in the words of toby keith &quot;i love this bar!&quot; <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-7pm $1.75 beers, but if you miss <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> don't fret, domestic beers are only $2.25 all the time! i highly recommend stopping in on wednesdays where you get an 8 oz steak, baked potato, green beans and a salad for $10! super friendly bar staff, pool table, juke box = good times!

i love their lunch and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials! great food and great customer service!one of my favorite restaurants.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> m-f till 8pm only in bar. would have given 5 stars but the hostess didn't share there was a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sat us in the restaurant :/ now we know!
bomb shrimp cocktails!! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> lunch special is the best! all for 10$!! with a beer or margarita!
shrimp cocktail is pretty good &amp; mango margarita. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is til 8pm for the drinks. pretty good deal on drinks here. its by the 60 freeway off mountain ave.
great for <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>....prices are very reasonable and food portions are quiet large. great atmosphere for everyone....sit by the bar section to enjoy a great time!
wow! 9.99 for two huge ceviche tostadas and a margarita on the rocks for lunch. &nbsp;for what your getting it makes life sensational!ramon the bartender whips up the most delish &nbsp;drinks and is very accommodating. &nbsp;come here to unwind after work and enjoy the amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
food was phenomenal. it comes with soup and chips and salsa. they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu under $10 and it includes a drink. atmosphere was great as well, &nbsp;i really enjoyed how clean and professional the restaurant was. my only complaint is that the service is slow to bring items you are looking for.
this place is amazing! &nbsp;the cadillac margaritas are to die for seriously! &nbsp;the service is excellent and the food is delicious. &nbsp;the lunch special and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are so amazing, i can't even believe that they are making money. &nbsp;great job!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is great!! customer service can be be really good or really bad. food is grey though try the nachos, they're great for a big group (sharing's caring). i got the ceviche which is $6.50 huge portion!!! couldn't even finish it all.
good seafood. grilled shrimp was awesome, so was the bacon wrapped shrimp. fish was a little salty but nothing a little lime cannot fix. we went on a weekday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so it was a bit noisy. perhaps restaurant might consider seating people away from the party goers. will definitely go back.
the food here is delicious and the service is great. my experiences here have me feeling like family. my food always has a great home cooked taste with the art of presentation and plating that make all the difference. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> has a great selection of apps and drinks monday thru thursday 11am-8pm, and friday 10am-6pm. sundays they have live music.in all my experiences with el pescador this place has been lively during the day and especially at night.
i love this place....been here a couple of times before. i love their ceviche de camaron!! yum...i love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> til 8pm every weekday except friday!!! service is okay...they can be better but very friendly. great place to watch sports and have a couple of drinks with your friends.
so they seat us in the main dining area. we came here for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks because the deals are really good. so our group all orders several drinks each. the waitress then informs us that they won't split the check. ok whatever, one of us has to take all the bill. so the bill comes and it is way more then it should be. they charged us full price. it turns out we weren't in the vip section, but in a section where <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> doesn't apply. i tell her we didn't know, they just sat us here. she says sorry and walks away. we tell the cashier and the waitress comes back. i think they should of given us the special as first timers we didn't know.
the food here is pretty good depending on what you order. service has always been good.i also love the drinks however they are a bit inconsistent sometimes.. &nbsp;i've had the best drinks there and then gone back and gotten average drinks. &nbsp;i guess it depends who's working at the bar. &nbsp;good micheladas. &nbsp;good mexican cocktails. &nbsp;decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
my friends brought me here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a wednesday afternoon... 2.75$ margaritas!! nice and strong, too! i noticed previous reviews slamming this place hard, so i was leary of their quality from the get go.we started with some buffalo wings and guacamole. &nbsp;both were well presented, the buffalo wings were delicious and the guacamole was fresh and flavorful. &nbsp;i would have enjoyed more heat in my guacamole but it was alright.for entrees, we had the aguas chile, which is shrimp cooked with lemon...very tasty! plump, succulent shrimp with vibrant, fresh flavors...very nice!i had the skirt steak with beans and rice. &nbsp;the steak was cooked extra thin &amp; grilled very nicely. &nbsp;the meat was nice and tender.the shrimp ceviche was loaded with fresh plump shrimp, cilantro, red onion and avocado...all served atop a crispy thin tostada. &nbsp;squeezed a few limes and chile on top and it was sheer perfection!overall, i had an excellent experience...and my friends, both i might add, are mexicans, thought it was very authentic, fresh and flavorful!i would definitely come back, especially for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!<span class="highlighted">happy</span> eats!
this el pescador mexican grill was very impressive. &nbsp;i've been to several other el pescador so i decided to come to this one. &nbsp;as always, the food was delicious!!!!i love the new decor they have on this location. best part, new &quot;bar&quot; area with a bunch of exotic drinks. &nbsp;perfect place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i highly recommend it. lastly, very affordable.
i really wanted to like this place. they have some decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, and that's about where it stops for me. i ordered two fish tacos with no onions or cilantro, which the waitress repeated back about 3 times, so i know it probably wasn't her fault but it came out loaded with onions and cilantro. it took about her 10 minutes for her to return to our table by which point my boyfriend was already done with his food. she took my plate back and returned me with what i thought would be a new plate in about 5 minutes and when i took the first bite i was pretty certain they used the same fish from my old place because it was cold and soggy. i didn't even finish it. sill got charged for it. i will tell everyone to avoid this place.
this place is awesome. my wife (who has lived in chino for over 20 years was telling me how no business ever survived this location ... according to her, it had been several different restaurants before el pescador took over some years ago. so we never went. about a month or so ago we decided just to check it out. wow ... this place is off the hook! the margaritas are rocking (they have the biggest selection of tequila i have ever seen at a local business), the food is solid (i love the fish tacos, or the carnitas) . and they have pretty decent flan. we've been back a couple times since (icing on the cake is they have deals on <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restaurant.com</a>), and will keep going. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a must!
came here on a random weekday afternoon and it was the lunch <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.i did the drink and meal for 7.99 option and was satisfied.the chips and salsa were bangin' and our service was great.i didn't have to ask our server for a refill once on chips or for our drinks.for my meal option i chose the cheese enchiladas. they came and they were tasty, but nothing really fabulous.the guacamole tasted like it was packaged, sad.the beans were good but the rice was disappointing.i was surprised too because i was hung over and usually everything tastes way better when you're hung over.seeing as that the food was just alright, i'm not sure if i'll make it a point to come back. but hey, if i end up there again somehow.. i wouldn't be upset about it.

i love this place! i'm not much for hookah, but the food is delicious and reasonably priced. sit in the patio area.... there is a beautiful fountain and you get a front row to the trains passing by! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on drinks can't be beat(wine $3) and done forget the bread pudding dessert. i mean before this place i've never even eaten bread pudding but omg. it's to die for here!
found this place when i was looking for a good hookah/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> location for after work. the only thing better than the hookah and drinks was the delicious food. i suggest the chicken kabobs. they were full of flavor and not too pricey.
this was our first time going tonight. some of our friends recommended this place, so we thought we would give it a try. we were really surprised by their hookah which is good quality, and just really a nice smooth taste. we had the watermelon and peach flavor hookah. some of our other party had watermelon and mint which was tasteful, however for me i prefer the watermelon and peach. we didn't try their food, because we stopped at dave and busters first, so there was no need, however will return back for food another time, that simply was not the mission tonight.we sat outside, and the patio area was nice and cool. the atmosphere was perfect and the dj (boss) totally revved it up, and of course we partied. we created our own dance area, that's how we like to party, and we had a great time. there were big screens outside, however no one was really watching, the dj had our full attention.now, yes there is the metro link right there, however maybe because of the time, it was late, it only passed by once that i noticed, and the dj was playing his music so we were not disturbed by the train. the drinks were average price for what we are accustomed to paying outside of a &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; price, and honestly they were good, so no complaints. the service was on top of everything, and was very accommodating. plenty of parking available and easy to find location. not sure if i would venture here in the day, but will find out because of business i will return in the day, and update if any change in view. i didn't give it a 5, because i did not try the food, so i can only write about my experience with what i tried. just a side note, advertisement states they close at 2am, however depending on amount of people may close at 12am or so.
my girlfriend and i came here for the first time 2 nights ago to give it a try since we were in the mood to try something new and have driven passed this place on a daily basis since we live around the corner. we were a bit weary at first glance since it didn't appear busy but after walking in the restaurant is very nice inside and also offers an outside patio with a projector to watch the games. additionally they offer hooka outside as well which i thought was pretty cool even though we didn't have any. the outside is a good size and offers various tables and booths for various size parties ...it was fairly slow when we went so it's hard to say how it is outside when busy with people smoking hooka but the ambiance outside is nice with a waterfall wall in the background but be prepared for random loud horns from the trains as they go by since they pass by just on the other side of the patio. although the trains were quite loud and scared us unexpectedly it is beyond the control of the restaurant and staff and thus does not effect the quality of the service and food.  &nbsp; &nbsp; we started with spicy hummus which was amazing and they give you a generous portion with plenty of warm pita bread. for dinner we shared the &quot;choose 3&quot; kabobs which come with rice and veggies that are absolutely delicious!!! we chose the filet mignon and the chicken (which came with an amazing garlic salt pur&eacute;e type sauce on the side) this was plenty of food for the 2 of us to share but we also got an additional side of rice because it was that tasty. lastly we finished off with the creme br&ucirc;l&eacute;e which was also very tasty! next time we want to try their bread pudding that comes with a scoop of ice cream too cause other reviewers say it's amazing. i don't remember the name of our server but he was amazing as well! although it wasn't busy or packed in there we enjoyed every bit of it and would recommend the food to anyone. we will be back and maybe to try their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as well!
hidden gem! after antique shopping in the area, my wife wanted some good (healthy) food other than the yelp listings of mexican, chinese, burgers or other fast food that seemed to dominate. &nbsp;so at first sight of the place, we both said &quot;there's nothing here&quot;. &nbsp;but the building looked nice and clean from the outside and it was next door to the metrolink train station. well let me tell you, it was delicious!. we ordered the chicken kabob plate and the caramelized roasted salmon, and both did not disappoint in terms of presentation, portion and most of all - taste! the spicy hummus was a little spiceless, but tasted fresh. &nbsp;ended with a dessert we never tried before called kafne, which can only be described as baked cheese with lightly sweetened bread crumbs. they give you a spoon but use a knife to cut the somewhat chewy but not so sweet dessert. &nbsp;the waitress was very friendly and attentive. couldn't believe the place is open for breakfast and as late as 2:00 a.m. on the weekends. &nbsp;very clean with outdoor covered patio, although inside is nicer. the trains going by felt like you were in a travel destination somewhere in the world. we were there on a sunday about 4:00 p.m. so we owned the place and had to ask if it was open. the prices were very fair and they told us about the sunday brunch from 10 - 2 for about $14 and served with mimosas. &nbsp;also mentioned <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> m-f 3 - 7. &nbsp;very good for a just opened restaurant. will definitely be back whenever we're in the area (antique shopping) since we live a little far. &nbsp;keep up the good work and food guys! thanks,<span class="highlighted">happy</span> first timer.

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> = bomb
ordered mushroom and zucchini appetizer and it was very fresh and hot! the wings were the same and of course their homemade chips are always super good!! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! totally recommend this place!
i came here after work. love their mango habienaro, chipotle bbq, and honey bbq wings. we also shared chicken bruschetta, which was rather tasty. i must say, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is cheap.
uncrowded and that was a plus during lunch <span class="highlighted">hours</span>! service was fast and they have a good draft beer selection. various flavors for wings and surprisingly the sriracha lime was the best! i love spicy. they could add a bit more sauce onto to the wings - a lil stingy but still good. &nbsp;didn't make it to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> -bummer, but aside from their 3-6 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tues. - fri. they have all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sun and mon. so i'll be back!
there used to be more food options but they redid the menu a while back and our favorite item is gone. the food is okay, especially if you are going there for wings. they also have good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials and have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day sunday and monday.
love this place great wings!...but they used to have the chicken strips on their sunday and monday all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and not anymore! ended up paying double the price as usual. and the waitress brought us the wrong beers.
this place is where it's at for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials and good food. granted i'm pretty loyal to the chicken nachos and jalape&ntilde;o poppers but i've tried a few other items on the menu and i haven't been disappointed yet. sunday and monday is all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! me and my bf usually stop by here every other week and it always hits the spot. they have a wide selection of beers on tap and the service is always fast and friendly.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is where its at!with hardly any space for a stack of napkins a group of 4 can fill a table with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials including drinks for around $80. you pay for what you get and $80 will get you &nbsp;plenty. the food is great, i normally stick to wings and appetizers. &nbsp;like any wing flavors at any wing dealer stick to the wet ones. as far as appetizers go try as many as you can there all delicious. service is great and the atmosphere is friendly. proud to be a wingnuts fan!
i've officially changed my mind about this place. awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! im in love with the honey bbq wings. they're a little spicy but awesome! i'm a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> <span class="highlighted">happy</span> girl today!
one of my favorite places! but was disappointed today after finding out they took out their amazing chicken strips off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu :( however they have a buy an entree get one free soooo that's still good :) aside from that the food is def good!
place has bomb flavors. love the variety. better then wild wings. they also have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day sunday. perfect for sports. the ribs are fall off the bone good. mango habenerio is the best
great beer variety glad they have darker beers, great sundays all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and most if not all football games on tv's. 1/2 all appetizers
good food kinda high on prices and for beer too had a sam adams small glass. nearly 8 dollars. we were not advised anything on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the burger was small that the bun engulfed the whole patty. small portion of chips and too much lettuce. will not return.
i'm nuts about wings, therefore this place is a must for that first timers. &nbsp;good flavors and variety of meats to choose from, and not just nuts, i mean wings... tip: go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and you won't disappoint your wallet. &nbsp;overall, it depends solely on you to judge this place around pomona-claremont-monclair.ambiance 4.4flavor 4.5presentation 4.3service 4.3price 4.3grade: 4.36
went on a weeknight right before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> rush. conveniently located rt off the fwy in a strip mall area. the restaraunt is not as big as buffalo wild wings which might be good for those that enjoy a smaller eatery. ended up having a yummy chicken salad and a cold one. rtn visit only if in the area.
i frequent this restaurant with my family at least one a week. they have great all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> offerings on sundays and their menu has a great variety of food other than wings. the staff is very nice and always friendly especially carlos, doug, liz and edgar. i recommend their wings over bww any day.
their sunday breakfast menu is huge. i had the chicken and waffles. so good. too much food. came with two waffles,fried chicken and potatoes. i love their bloody mary too. we come about once a month for all day sunday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. have never been disappointed .
i liked this place for there beer on tap, extra tasty hot wings and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. at first i wanted buffalo wild wings &nbsp;but didn't want to drive or deal with the large crowds or wait for a table. &nbsp;i decided to try the local wingnut spot and was very <span class="highlighted">happy</span> i did. they have friendly service and had plenty of seating to watch a game. their &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials were pretty good and the bar was ice cold. perhaps their only draw back would be their tv's. they were ok but didn't seem have super high definition which is a huge plus when watching a sports game. &nbsp;all in all i had a great time at wingnuts and would definalty go back.
awesome!!!! stopped here on a whim and what a great experience. food is amazing and prices are great. we have made another trip back even though a little out of our way. ant wait to go back again!!!!!! not sure about the bad reviews on here. i thought everything was delicious, well priced, great service, and a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!
my only complaint is that one of the times i went, the power went out on the whole block. we were still there for about 30 mins after the power went out, and the staff wouldn't let us leave because they couldnt remember how many beers we ordered, therefore wouldnt give us our bill. big turn off. i like their food, &amp; they usually have good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals, but i will never go there again because of that one incident. i prefer bww anyways :)
what the heck?! we loved this location, we looked forward to our <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> here, with wings, they removed them from the specials. then they had 'strips' to replace those and now, those are gone too! honestly if you are a wing place and you don't put wings or strips on special then why would you eat here? now the only good &nbsp;thing left is the staff!
general-only went there for lunch. they have a killer lunch deal from 11a-3p which is buy 2 drinks and buy one entree, get the 2nd entree free. so my bro or co-worker and i *i work in ontario* gets a 20 pce wing platter or the wing and rib platter. going with 3 folks? no problem, just order a beer for the 4th drink and get 2 entrees free. this is a steal. price-very cheap with the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal. $10 per personbut without the deal it's easily$15-$20 but keep in mind, im a fatass.drinks-many many many beers on tap and bottles. also has a wine. full on bar with tv's.food quality-it appears to be very good, but everything i get is deep fried so i wouldn't really know.food portions-big!!! some of the wings rival kfc legs...food taste-has about 40 different type of chicken wing flavors and about 12 rib flavors. the bbq mac salad is good. but i recommend getting ranch sauce. the best flavors are honey bbq, lemon pepper and scheswan. the diablo is spicy as hell...ambiance/environment-since i always went there for lunch, you have everyday type of folks who are eating lunch on their breaks. otherwise it's like a sports bar. kinda like hooters except the waitresses were fat, but, they were still very kind.service-hit and miss. depends on the waitress. overall-i go there 3x per week so we got to know the regular workers there. the food is cheap because of the deal and you get full as hell. if you are a light eater, you can get 3 people full for about 20 bucks and eat like no tomorow. pros-the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal. great food. great variety. lots of parking and it's never packed during the daycons-the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> will stop and i will feel ripped off if paid full price
this was my first time going here today and to be honest even with the price being more than reasonable i thought their wings were still shitty. i felt the sauces were generic and not really flavorful at all. this place should have a way better <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> especially with the food being as plain as it is. they need to reconsider the way they cook there wings( even if there is 3 dozen flavors or so) and look on getting people a cheaper buzz because thats the only way to enjoy it.
i went here last week to watch the usc game with my dad and bf. go trojans!!!! ... that makes two times at this location and it gives me a decent idea of the place. parking: huge lot!service: deserves a 5/5 star. this is the only reason why i keep coming back to this spot. service has always been on point. the waiter and waitress i had were both courteous, quick, always refilled our water and came around pretty often. food:one word: subpar. +the jalepeno popper: pretty yummy!+<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and daily specials: great deals-the wings: have gotten pretty down hill over the years, they're dry and do not have much flavors. just ehhhh.... i would only come back on wednesday when the wings are on specials, and during office <span class="highlighted">hours</span> for cheap drinks! but i really hope they can bring up the quality of their wings to bring it up to par.
came to wingnuts for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and they have some pretty sweet deals, half off all appetizers, and $5.50 for a 23 oz imported or premium brews, $3.75 for domestic beers. i had to go with the sam adams cherry wheat beer which was great, sweet but not to feminine. &nbsp;and we split a surf and turf appetizers lemon pepper shrimp, about 8 of them pretty good a little to lemony tasting, and 4 buffalo chicken strips, that i enjoyed, and it came with blue cheese dressing, it was $9.80 but because of hh it only cost me $4.90. go in for hh, some great deals.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the worse time to go during weekends. service slow, not attentive, food slow to come. basically order drink and u can get any appetizer 1/2 off. we ordered bbq ribs and it came with the propeller chips. we were not told that and ordered side of propeller chips. whole table filled with chips! wish server could have been nicer to tell us that. ribs was too salty. &nbsp;ordered mini dogs and it was salty too, although the dog itself is juicy once you remove the fried skin. we never got refills, had to ask for it, and figured we should leave b/f having to wait forever for wings. what a nut we were for coming here, and left w/o any wings.
came here with my nursing girls after a dreadful class and it was just what we needed. we came during 65 cent wings wednesday and i got 6 chipotle bbq wings and 6 pomegranate wings. they also came with ranch, celery, and potato chips, which we weren't aware of until the order came. you also had to order a beverage to get the 65 cent wings, and water didn't count. i'm not a fan of the chips because they were way too salty. the wings themselves were not too bad, but they weren't amazing either.wingnuts is a great place to come and socialize. it's probably packed during big games and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i would say that it's a nice kickback place. but i don't know if i would come back anytime soon.
i had just got into town on a sunday night and was starving, when i saw the &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day today&quot; banner on the building. what an awesome way to promote yourselves. that was enough to stop the search immediately for me, and pull my <span class="highlighted">happy</span> ass in for some chicken wings. when i first walked in, i immediately fought the urge to groan and shake my head. i don't know why every goddamn chicken wing place has to go with the whole aviation/plane theme (yeah, i get it. planes have wings, lolz) and it's just ridiculously cliche by now. oh well, i guess it's the &quot;clever&quot; new thing these days, like how sushi places are all naming their rolls the &quot;booty booty super dui 3 am pile-up with a transvestite&quot; or whatever retarded shit they can come up with. anyway, appetizers were half off, so i ordered the buffalo chicken nachos to start. they were pretty damn good, and got us full for $5 before our wings came out. seriously, as soon as the waitress brought out our wings, we packed them up, took them back to the hotel. so, hell yeah for chicken wings for breakfast the next morning!way better than wingstop, and i might have to make another trip to hooters for comparison. way better prices/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> than hooters offers, and i'd definitely be returning if wingnuts were to build a location in fresno.
for the wing connoisseur this place slams buffalo wild wings. lemon pepper (dry rub) deserves 5 stars, service is a hit or miss and that is why i down graded from giving 4 stars. a must try are the potato chips they give instead of fries which make a close 2nd to the l&amp;p wings. ask for a side of bbq sauce and dive them bad boys homemade chips into it and it's aaaammmmaaaazzzing! on sunday's it's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day and appetizers are half off. stay away from the chicken nachos because they are chunks of meat on some chips with some cheese aka wack! but look here's the bottom line if you want a good variety of meaty bone wings, some decent tv's, beer on tap with no big crowds... then this is a spot to give a try. been back 3 times and i've come out a fluffy, <span class="highlighted">happy</span> camper!
as the name suggest, wingnuts has great wings.i've come here quite a few times before and it always is my go-to spot for wings and a tall glass of guinness. they have lots of beer to choose from (like 20+ on tap) and have about 20-30 flavors of wings and they change it up every so often. my favorite used to be tequila but they got rid of it.. now i guess it's the mango habanero. the service is usually pretty spot on and the tables are big and comfortable. parking sort of sucks though but it's manageable. i never come here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because i heard it gets crazy so i can't comment on that, but i can say that service during normal <span class="highlighted">hours</span> is great. i would recommend this place to anyone, but it can get a little pricey so a star knocked off for that. overall i keep comin' back.
i really don't want to like wingnuts. i've been there twice and both times have left with a similar feeling. considering the location, decor, and food quality, i expect it to be really cheap. it's not. in fact, the food is sort of expensive and doesn't taste good. i've eaten the chicken strips with a couple different sauces (they have a lot of sauce choices) and the buffalo chicken wrap. the strips were okay. the buffalo wrap was like someone made a paste out of chicken and blue cheese dressing and coleslaw and stuffed it in a tortilla. that's not a wrap! yuck.but, the reason i keep going back is because the beer list is pretty nice. while it's not cheap, i've paid more than $8 for 22oz of big daddy ipa (not easy to find around here!) plenty of times. there are lots of beers you don't see often, and they come in two sizes. i do like places that wil give me a big beer.they have daily specials (i dont know them all): <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day sunday and monday to save a few dollars on beers, 50 cent wings on wednesday, buy dinner on a friday and night and get discounted tickets to the movie theater across the street. overall, i won't make the mistake of ordering food here again unless the situation is pretty bleak, but i will probably be back for a beer.
i wanted to give it more stars, for the simple fact that it's not a chain (every friggin' wings place out there is part of a chain), but their wings are pretty hit and miss. i like the fact that there is a wide selection of wings. a very large selection in fact. also, i love their mac salad. it's quite tasty. on the other hand... like i said before, their wing flavors are hit and miss. there are some that are crazy good. there are some that are just okay. and there are some that leave you scratching your head, haha. my friends and i decided to make it a tradition to go every wednesday for their wing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, or whatever it's called. we would each get one or two wing flavors, and that way we slowly got to try most of the flavors. now that i moved back to la county i kinda miss it, if only because of the fact that it was a cool tradition to go here and watch an nba or nfl game. that's another thing i like, their prices. well, you have to know what and when to order, but when you squeeze their best deals together you end up saving quite a penny while trying some rather appetizing wings.
the best wings i have found and i have eaten at a lot of wing places. wing nuts is a great local place with sooo many sauce options you really will find your favorite right here. the staff is always friendly and the games are on. the bar is small but still have good choices. sunday or monday you will usually find me there because its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day. doesn't get much better &nbsp;then this.you have about 35 choices of flavors and thats just for the wings. i would highly suggest the strips instead of the wings only because they make their own daily from fresh breasts.i do have to say that the last 2 times i was in the strips were cold and i had to send them back, okay three times but then they were amazing the manager had to make them himself, he is always so helpful. but that aside i will go back again and again. oh ya you must have the blue cheese cole slaw really really the best cole slaw i have ever had

awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> every night!
we go there on a regular basis and always eat at the bar. &nbsp;all the bartenders are super friendly and efficient, &nbsp;especially &nbsp;ryan. we were a little disappointed that they stop <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at 6:00. &nbsp;love the rib sliders which are on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu.
had a midweek <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at the elephant bar and wasn't very impressed. they change their menus and have taken off a lot of the favorites i used to like. ahi tuna is ok maybe even a little tough, the sliders were good flavor but nothing special. i think i'll be trying other restaurants for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for $32 for three people : 4 plates (fish taco, quesadilla, coconut shrimp skewers, lettuce wraps), 1 ice tea, 1 sangria. = <span class="highlighted">happy</span> people! the food is better than the drinks, (altho they are beautifully decorated) so id stick to beers and wines if i were you. (hence my 3 star rating)i like our server ashley, she's sharp and astute. anyhoo, not much you can go to around ie, so elephant bar it is! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is until 7pm!
food is very good!! service is wonderful! great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and watch sports in the bar. &nbsp;i like the cowboy ribeye, and the wife likes the thai high chicken salad. &nbsp;all the food is good. i've never had a bad meal here. this could become a regular place for us.
wow! i had such an awesome experience tonight. &nbsp;not only was the service fast and friendly but thet were spot on. the food &nbsp;came out hot and exact. &nbsp;im a bit picky and they catered to my needs. highly recommend stopping by to get dinner or a drink. &nbsp;awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as well. for sure comming back!
i'm totally impressed with their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;very large menu with great prices. &nbsp;the lettuce wraps and coconut shrimp were great! &nbsp;highly suggest it!service in the bar was great.
i always enjoy the food at elephant bar. &nbsp;we go there at least twice a month. this last visit, there was only one bartender that was excellent but she was running around like crazy. i also feel that the menu is not very good since they changed it. &nbsp;i think they need to advertise their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> more. i am going to have to rethink my dining choices because it is just not the same.
i had a great tasting raspberry lemondrop martini. &nbsp;there was no skimping on the vodka. the bonus was the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price. &nbsp;thanks eb! &nbsp;too bad the tempura salmon roll was awful. &nbsp;it had too much sushi, a few very small pieces of salmon, plenty of tofu, and some avocado half way through. &nbsp;two <span class="highlighted">hours</span> later i have a tummy ache.
last thursday, i called elephant bar at 2p.m. in the afternoon. i spoke with a friendly young lady. the purpose of my call was to see if they could accommodate my handicapped sister and mother. i wanted to take them to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but with my sister's leg brace, and with my 87 year old mom 's limited mobility, i knew we could not sit in the higher bar chairs. the waitress on the phone assured me that elephant bar would accommodate us. when we arrived at elephant bar, the hostess told us we could not sit in the bar. there were only tall stills available. not handicapped assessable. when i asked to speak with a manager, a young man approached me. he said there was room in the bar. when he took me to look at the space it was for three. there were four in our party. he told us elephant bar could not do more. i was upset. we come to elephant a lot for family gatherings. my sister and mother were visibly upset that they were not being considered. we were told we could not order on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. when our waitress appoached, she could see i was shaken.i explained the treatment we received from the male manager. she offered to get another manager. bertha approached our table, and she listened to our concerns.she was respectfull of my elderly mother and handicapped sister. she told us she would accommodate us. i will go back to elephant bar because of bertha, and our thoughtful waitress. please elephant bar talk to bertha about how to treat all people with dignity.please note our final bill was mostly not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items, we just wanted the consideration.
had dinner here with the fiancee last night before the angel's game @ 7.we sat at the bar because i wanted the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. we first started out with a lg newcastle &amp; &nbsp;sm bud lt &amp; sweet potato fries. the fries were ok. kinda too soggy for my taste. i like crispy fries... also too much salt. preferred it salt free.then we order our entrees, oak grilled rainbow trout w/ lobster sauce &amp; braised beef on noodles. both entrees came pretty quickly. i asked for extra sauce because i'm saucy like that... but that made the fish too buttery. the noodle &amp; beef was yummy. only had a chance to steal 2 bites from neil. the noodles were a little doughy for me... would have like it to be thinner pressed.overall...ok.
busy busy!! yummy appetizers the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good deals and great food!!there chicken wraps / sushi rolls / buffalo strips / sweet potato fries/ &nbsp;and margaritas and rum drinks are good. dinners not so good portion is ok. but their plates are kinda of bland!!appetizers are not. at the bar is busy but if u get the seating at the round area of the bar as soon as u sit the bartender sees u and takes ur order i usually order appetizers and drinks so they don't take long to come back and place uour order! delicious recommend it
i usually come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and enjoy their drinks. &nbsp;i hate sitting in the dining room because service is usually slow. &nbsp;but my girl insisted we sit there so we did. (easier to agree than to fight) anyways our server came over with the same old boring spill. blah blah blah. and i thought great i should of sat at the bar. but as she progressed she actually knew what she was talking about. well i was surprised. &nbsp;and she was quite attentive. &nbsp;as soon as my beer was more than half way she asked right away. i would definitely sit back in the dining room as long as liz is my server.
3 star because there was nothing really wrong, but it also did not stand out as anything super special.we walked in early on a wednesday night and where seated right away. we asked about the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials and where told it was only in the bar area. the hostess moved us to the bar without question.we ordered an appetizer and beer, our server came right back with our drinks, and another server came with the appetizer. it did take a bit for our server to get back to us to take our order. but once he did he was very helpful with our questions. the other server brought our food out pretty quickly. both of our dishes where good, well prepared and decent portions.my grip with this place, and others similar to it is the menu. why must it be 10 pages with 15 different ethnic styles?? elephant bar does not fit into a category like diner, asian, french...etc. it is just food on a menu. with that i am in no rush to run back here.
maybe i'm just really lucky cause i've always had good service here!! i especially love their <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, the thai lettuce wraps, the jambalaya, the sweet potato fries, and the kona kooler!! :) my friends and i have had some close intimate dinners as well as some big group events and we have never faced any issues with this place. their waiters and waitresses are really nice. there's never been an exceedingly long wait and i think the prices are fair!!they're willing to substitute your white rice for brown rice, free of charge.. they can split your orders (since the portion is huge) and they dont mind if one person want white rice while the other person wants brown rice :) one time i was being picky and they gave me both in a yin and yang shape!! lol!! i always sit around and chill, they never rush me!! and i love the wanton ice cream thing they give you on/around your birthday!! one time they brought us our two, so we both can have one, even though it was only on one of our birthdays!! haha...overally many good meals and many good memories here!! :)

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> best time
food is bleh. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> doesn't apply in the restaurant (only the bar) yet they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials posted at the tables in the restaurant. go to the bar to get them, though. makes no sense.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around 6pm, but probably won't be back anytime soon. &nbsp;the food is what you'll find in your typical &quot;fancy&quot; mexican restaurants. &nbsp;we basically ordered the entire <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu from taquitos, quesadillas, guacamole, and chicken wings. &nbsp;the food was good, but nothing memorable.our waitress seemed inattentive and forgetful. &nbsp;service was slow when the restaurant wasn't that busy.
good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.i came here for an event and the cantina was poppin. but the bartender was slow and they didn't have enough staff to meet all the demand. they had a dj though which was cool for a restaurant. there's a small dancefloor and a bunch of us were dancing around.
i went there during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and to be honest it was pretty good. the only food that i dislike was the extreme nachos, they tasted kind of raw and it felt like they were overcooked. the place is a little small and like one of the other people that commented on acapulco, it does get a litle noise after the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends!besides that, everything else was ok! the drinks were very intriguing, beer prices were reasonable, but it might a little pricey for the normal joe smoe!! i liked the bonesless wings and the buffalo are pretty good to. there is good entertainment and a good dj jamming on some hits at times...it's an ok place, no the best but for a quick fun night out...not a bad place at all!!
this place is pretty decent for friday night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;they play old school, drinks are cheap and the chips are plentiful. &nbsp;the crowd is a bit older, just like the music, but if you bring your girl its alright, just dont come looking for one or you will be disappointed. &nbsp;oh yeah, and stick to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu or you will be disappointed again.
my wife and i went here on a tuesday night for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sat in the cantina. we had the place to ourselves, they had a table full of chips/salsa that you can help yourself to. we got a few margaritas and appetizers for real cheap and left <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with full bellies for only $25! (including tip)
there is always coupons for acapulco in the paper so thats what brought us in! &nbsp;we had the place to ourselves for the first half of our meal! &nbsp;we sat in the dining room and the waitress was nice enough to let us get the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials which were only supposed to be in the bar! &nbsp;we each got our own meal but one meal easily could have fed all three of us!great value and service-we will be back!
last week i went in on monday with a group of friends, i was informed it was monday margarita and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4-8 at the bar! what can i say best deal by far :) the cocktail server was friendly she upgraded our margaritas for $1 more! i'll definitely be retuning with my friends! the vibe was great and the wings were yummy!
well 2 dollar margarita mondays , and tuesday kids eat free but this place isn't what it use to be food is still good but it's dead and they seem to have lost plenty of cliental , on tv screens tennis and some reality show &nbsp;but i will say this the bartender extremely kind and attentive , and it really is nice to go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after a long day of working , it's just a chill place so that you won't die of boredom , take a friend overall it's ok
this is my go-to spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with my girlfriends, although the last few months i've noticed that the drinks seem a bit less &quot;leaded&quot;, and there is no longer a table with help-yourself chips and salsa, your waitress brings them now....food is generally good, standard mexican fare, with occasional special dishes and all-you-can-eat meals. their shrimp and spinach queso is wonderful most of the time, last week for some reason it was thin and not as dip-like. &nbsp;all in all a decent basic mexican restaurant with reasonable prices.
damn you acapulco for having such a sweet ass <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but such bad service, you seriously broke my heart. came here last night for a bday gathering we had a huge crowd and everyone complained about the service and getting orders mixed up.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 4 to 7, $3.95 for house margaritas, $3 well drinks, half off appetizers, and they also have some free food, such fluatas and beans. the regular price for well drinks is $4.25 and $4.75 for a large bud light, so still not bad prices.the drinks were of course pretty watered down. the food came kind of cold, and it took about 30 minutes to get. our table was not brought any plates, napkins silver ware, love, chips, salsa, or water. i just think the poor waitress was handling too many tables and people and did a horrible job. seriously she straight ignored me a few times, brought me over the wrong drink once, and she forgot to place our order for calamari.if you do decide to come here for hh try the calamari, 3.35 hh price, macho-tizer appetizer. $5.99 hh price, comes with shrimp nachos, fried bananas and pork, 4 buffalo strips, and 4 taquitos.this place is large, but not enough tables, people were desperate for them. they do have a dance floor, a dj, and a failed attempt at karaoke.to top it off i went outside for some air and the douche bouncers at the bar, they set up around 730ish, i got there at 5 said they didn't see me leave the so they needed to see my id, i showed it to them and they didn't believe it was me so i has to show them another id. after they decided i was old enough to be at a bar, they tried to say i had to pay $6, which i of course said i'm not paying anything, i just walked for some air, and they made the first smart decision in their lives and stopped hassling me and let me in.
years ago, i used to meet a friend here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i remember the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals being pretty decent, but their drinks were not very strong. &nbsp;chips are too thin to be really authentic style, but they are better than the typical store bought corn chip trying to pretend to be a tortilla chip and they are warm. this was not really my choice this time as i don't really like chain restaurants, but i was meeting relatives and didn't have a choice. i figured i would play it safe by getting soup and salad combo cuz you can't really screw that up. &nbsp;and i was right, the tortilla soup was good. lots of veggies. &nbsp;and caesar salad with cilantro pepita dressing was good also. my mom said her rice was too bland. &nbsp;my aunt said her enchilada and taco was &quot;okay.&quot; my big annoyance was their nutritional chart that they have at their table. oooh, cool! lets check this out. &nbsp;i'm gonna get something low fat! well, the calorie count is there, but for those that prefer counting fat grams, you are out of luck. it only lists saturated fat for each entree. and i am sure a lot of people don't even realize that and think that is actually the total fat grams. misleading. &nbsp;intentionally, misleading, i am sure. the salsa club starts in the evening. had to fight through all the cha cha chicks and latin music as we left.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in the catina is the bomb! 2-8pm every day $2.99 margaritas and food items!got a free entree up to $12.99 for my bday, so came to try it out. free chips and salsa (choice of 4). $2.99 house margaritas are gigantic, not very strong but still very tasty. ordered a muy grande platter for the entree, which came with shredded beef enchilada, grilled chicken and carnitas. it was a huge plate of good stuff. also ordered canita taquito which came with 3 for $2.99 - 5 stars - must order! the mini tostadita was ok. my waitress was super nice and attentive, refilled my water constantly, and checked back regularly - everytime with a beautiful smile. she was very pretty, very smart and very quick. love this place!
service has gotten really bad and the food is bland. i heard that they have a new manager which absolutely shows. one night we came in, it was empty besides one table but it took the guy (who acted like he was doing us a favor) more than 5 min to seat us. &nbsp;but, we gave it another chance for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and again it was bad. the drinks had very little alcohol and the spinach/shrimp queso was soooo watery it fell off the reheated greasy chips. . all in all i do not think i'll be going back.
well, i have been to this place like two or three times for weekend <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, just drinks and chips with friends. i was there on saturday for no longer than 20 min and parked right in front. the window of my car was broken out at 1:00 in the afternoon and some things were taken. the girl at the front desk said this is a common occurrence. i asked if they had cameras in the parking lot they said no. i just think, if this is such a common thing, they would want to protect their costumers and employees with either cameras or some type of security. dont leave anything in your car here. i wont be back :(

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around :)
2pm-8pm 40% <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, 75 cent taco tuesdays. i only like this place for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food
awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> which is good if your a poor college student
this place is amazing. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, strong drinks, billiards, darts, strong drinks, strong drinks. awesome staff.
this is my go to place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and pool with my number one. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 2-8. the girls there are always nice when serving us. this is the perfect place to sit out on the patio and just drink on a nice day. :]
all i got to say is <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and skeezers...nothing more...nothing less!
their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is pretty legit! &nbsp;taco tuesday= $2.25 beer, $.75 tacos and $2 tequila shots.
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around. 50% all food and drinks. friendly staff, great service. i love this place!
interesting establishment in upland. i came here to meet up with my roommate and her co-worker. they were surprised i had never come here. apparently they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. all i had was a glass of merlot which was about $3.00 so not bad at all. the vibe is really kick back. the service is a little slow but friendly. it's a fun place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...
cool place to watch a game. or shoot some pool. and i like their food and drinks...they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals. this place gets crackin... i love the vibe in there so lively!! easy parking.
this place is filled with older folks. people aren't lying when they say this is the cholo go to spot. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is pretty cool, not gonna lie. the atmosphere is wack. don't take the shots they offer they are watered down and are a waste of money. the waitresses are nice but i can tell they get bored. the music is not always great but i've only come on a wednesday night before with friends. definately not a hot spot as far as i can tell. the wings are decent sized you don't need to order a lot.
first off, i'd like to say that i'd never go to tequila hoppers for anything besides their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday from 2:30-6:30 pm. it is awesome! half off every single possible alcohol selection and food. i recognize the clientele is a little shady and unappealing, so my friends and i always sit in the corner spot. i've never had problems with shady characters approaching us, so it's all good. the drinks are always strong and the service is typically really good. like i said, i only come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so it's usually pretty empty. as for the other yelpers that gave them low ratings due to the cover charge, i agree with you. the cover prices they have are ridiculous, especially for fight nights, but give them another shot solely for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it may make you change your mind on tequila hoppers!
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is freakin awesome. half off everything from 2 - 8 everyday and they do raffles every friday giving away a free flatscreen tv. fun place. food is good not great
what can i say that hasn't been said about this place. great prices on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, food is ok and the servers are made to look like funny bunnies. those are the upsides if you will. terrible service, crappy atmosphere, &nbsp;terrible service, lack of knowledge about their own items, and terrible service. if you can get past all this and the douchebag men and women this is your spot. oh and make sure to watch out for &quot;natalie&quot; she'll forget everything you ordered.
drinks are good with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> being 40% off all drinks....food sucks though. service was good the girls are nice. music kindve sucks, it was my first time there, i dnt know if i would really go back....too empty
loveee this place, for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday 2-8, its super long and half off everything on the menu! my boyfriend and i go there for the mile high nachos, definitely worth it and they live up to their name! and the pitchers of beer (before i was pregnant) theres a ton of flatscreens and 2 pool tables. sometimes service can be a little slow but it can get pretty busy, once we started going there all the time the waitress remembered us and we got a lot faster service. definitely can't get a better <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> than this!=) also, after the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends at 8 they have different specials diff nights of the week, i like saturdays for the $3 you call its (or whatever they specifically call it!) make your own drinks for a good price!!=]
had a few drinks and a few appetizers at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, decently priced. went to the bathroom, and was waiting for the stall. during that time, a guy puked in he sink and clogged it, they were out of toilet seat protectors and i found a bag that appears to have previously stored drugs.
ghetto, ghetto, ghetto!!!!! only reason it gets anything above 1 star is because they do have insanely low drink prices during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and a ton of tv's.
celebrated a friends birthday...they over charged on two bills...the girl closed out because she was leaving wth... never heard that before....even another host was like i'm not sure why she did that. then had to wait to open it up again. one star for okay <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. definitely won't be going back there.
cheap beer but cheap people. &nbsp;the ghetto of ontario and upland call this place home. i will go here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but once the tables are moved out and the place becomes a &quot;club&quot; i'm out. &nbsp;not really into having old cholo's hit up on me. &nbsp;food's good though.
worst experience ever! lady at the front was very rude. you have to stand up and wave at the waiters to come to your table. it took 30 minutes! 30 minutes to get our drink. waiters never stopped at our table the whole time. place is cool. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good. service is horrible! ruined my experience. never coming here again. won't recommend this place to anyone.
we've been coming here for a long, long time. ever since the current management took over it has steadily gone downhill. very depressing and dirty. it's no wonder the waitresses &nbsp;seem as though they don't want to be there. i can see why all the rest of the regulars won't come here any more. the food is hit and miss, but ever since they did away with 40% off on food at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> we are done with this place. so good luck to the fat blonde manager that's all you have going for you.
good food average prices. &nbsp;good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. this place used to be a favorite of mine, but now the get pregnant contagion is in full swing. &nbsp;there are plenty of better breastaurants in the area with ladies that make the time and the money spent more worth it. &nbsp;i used to drop $20 for food and $50 in tips for the girls: this time i tipped $2 and walked out.
i've come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which is not competitive compared to other places in the neighborhood. this place becomes a club during the after <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. when it becomes a club, this place gets packed with people. it's the only place in town that i have found where women have to pay to get it, whether or not its crackin or totally dead. there is no way to find this out until you pay the $5 fee and step through the doors. :-(taco tuesdays are chill to catch a game and enjoy some $2.00 beers and tacos.
love tequila hoppers!!!! the food and service is outstanding, especially <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;my favorite items are the macho nachos yummm and their mexican chicken salad! &nbsp;great place to meet friends after work play a game of pool, and watch the numerous games on their flat screen tv's.
cool &nbsp;place to have a cold one during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and watch sports on the dozens of tv's all around the joint, &nbsp;service was decent during my visit and it get busy as the evening progresses, &nbsp;we ordered a mexisampler plate and it was nor good at all, &nbsp;the meat on the tacos was dried out and just unappealing at all, but is best to pair food when consuming alcohol to better handle it.
their beer selection was good. their service was good as well, however the reason why i'm leaving them a 4 star rating is because i felt that the appetizer like the zucchini wedges weren't really up to bar. the breading was rough and the amount they give you for the cost wasn't worth it. other than that, it's a cool place to watch your favorite teams play! plus they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 6 to 8pm (i believe) !
best selection of beers and drinks in the area. best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 40% off everything until 8pm or 8:30. but either way its a great deal for what you can get. especially compared to other bars. the selection here puts other bars to sleep. ive noticed their beer selection is always changing and improving. if youre a beer freak youll love this place.
i have been going to this place for the last 7 years . its great for watching football,and lakers &nbsp;games on sundays and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;specials are half off everything on the menu from 2:30 -8 . this place always has some type of drink special going after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;ends. it used to turn into a small club on fri and sat but that has gone down in the past years . the crowds are not as big as they used to be and the girls arent as cute as they used to be but its still a cool place to hang . they have an outdoor smoking patio, 2 dart board ,and &nbsp;2 pool tables .you might not want to finish your night here on a fri or saturday but its a great place to start .be sure to come by on tues night , its always packed and always a good time .
it has it's moments. when you're a regular and you get to know the waitresses, this place is a good time. if you're new or just haven't been in awhile don't expect to get the best of service. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good and taco tuesday is worth it's weight in carne asada. other than that, it's a very typical sports bar with some interesting activities when the [televised] games are over (10pm+),
i stop in here time to time when i don't feel classy or particularly pretty, but am in search of a good time without leaving upland/claremont. on weeknights its usually full of middle-aged men just off work watching the game. they have about 20 tv screens. whatever game you want is on. the beer list is pretty impressive, and when they say &quot;small&quot; they mean a pint. the food is typical bar faire, nothing special but better than some and fairly affordable during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which is pretty much all the time. speaking of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, since no one else has i feel obligated to let you in on the deals:every day 2:30-8 half off food and drinkstaco tuesday (7pm) $2 mexican bottles, $1.50 tequila shots, .75 tacoslatin wednesdays (8pm) 1/2 of draft beer, appetizers, margaritasthursty thursdays: i sadly don't recall, but it starts at 7friday/saturday: you call it well-drinks $3.50 with a $5 cover after 8pm)sin sunday: 1/2 off food and drink all dayoverall it's a gross sports bar with lots of cheap, delicious beer.
went here with the wife on wensday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. everything was 50% off. &nbsp;i tryed arrogant bastard for the first time and .........well if you like guinness ur love bastared. &nbsp;i did try new castle summer ale and fell in love. &nbsp;the food was ok. we tryed the sampler (cheese sticks,quesadillas,potato skins). &nbsp;the bar keep was nice looking. kinda had a strang six pack going on. anyway see you next wensday yelpers!
this has been one of my favorite inland empire <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> for years and years. great prices, decent food (the tacos suck though) and a big location. two things: 1) this is a great place to get a dui. the cops stake out the parking lot, be careful.2) i don't think they've ever cleaned the lines for their taps. the last few times i've gone the beers i ordered tasted awful. they're unresponsive to fix this problem and i only order bottled beer there now.hopefully the management reads yelp and attends to these problems or i may end up taking my business elsewhere.
this is one of the most polarizing bars in the ie. &nbsp;either you love it here or you hate it. &nbsp;i've been here more times than i can count so my review is coming from a different perspective. &nbsp;i've been here on taco tuesdays, celebration &quot;holidays&quot; (st. patty's day, cinco de mayo), friday and saturday nights and football sundays. &nbsp;i keep coming back so i obviously love it. &nbsp;pretty good food, it's never made me sick and always well cooked. &nbsp;i suggest the mexican sampler. &nbsp; so fire &nbsp;and their drinks are awesome especially the bulldog and rose-royce margarita. &nbsp;and on sundays, they have an all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with their drinks being 40% off. &nbsp;how does it get better than that? &nbsp;the atmosphere is fun. &nbsp;i've never seen any fights break out since i've been there. &nbsp;anyone that's there is there to have fun and nothing less. i gave it four stars for two reasons: 1. they do charge to get in on the weekends after a certain time. &nbsp;$10 i believe which i think is absurd and the bathroom situation. &nbsp;they're too close together and too small. &nbsp;outside of that, if you're looking for a fun bar to turn up at for cheap, this is your spot.
this is our go-to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you can't beat it! 50% off all drinks and food 2-8pm seven days a week?!?! we try to come here at least once a month and invite a few of our friends to hang out. my husband loves the danny burger made with the parmesan bread and i go with the chicken strips and chili cheese fries (which i absolutely adore!). their chili cheese fries are bad ass because they use chili with meat (yes, meat!) and kidney beans. they have a large choice of beers on tap and i love their well margaritas. service can be give or take (depending on how busy it is) but overall it is always worth the wait. after you experience the spend thriftiness of tequila hoppers, no other <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> will compare. only downside is if you're there purely for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a saturday, make sure there's no ufc that night because hh will end at 6pm and then they want to charge $10 a person to stay after 6pm. also, the last time we used the juke box you couldn't hear the music i paid for (the old one used to work very well) so don't waste your money on that or using those <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2frestaurant.com&amp;s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restaurant.com</a> coupons. tequila hoppers always has a special and you'll never be able to use it (overheard a couple trying to use it during hh--no dice). i haven't been to the &quot;club&quot; part of it but i hear it can be a little ghetto but i'd love to go just to people watch for train wrecks. :) &nbsp;the only other downside are what the ladies wear as part of their &quot;work attire&quot; which might work for the gents but does nothing for me. when i used to go there in the early 2000s, the girls wore referee short/skirt combos and a short shirt but as time went on, it seemed they would be wearing less and less clothing. at one point, they were just wearing bikinis and my husband and i joked that the next time we would come in, it would be a topless bar. ;) even with that, i'm too economical to not go for some great food and drinks.
been to this place a couple of times. &nbsp;alot to be desired here. &nbsp;service is very slow....faster to just go the bar and get your own drinks, food is dice roll...some of it is good, some bad. &nbsp;clientele is definitely a younger punk type crowd. &nbsp;cover charge isnt worth the experience..!! &nbsp;if you go...go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and roll before 7pm...it doesnt get any better as the evening comes on.
went here on a friday evening to watch the yankees game. i was hesitant after the previous reviews. to my surprise i had fun &amp; enjoyed the hospitality of the employees. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is till 8pm which is 50% off everything on the menu! nachos &amp; buffalo wings were excellent! drinks were great &amp; made strong (to my liking)! beers were 50% off too. after 9pm it because a small club. i had a great time &amp; look forward to going again!
this place has one of the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing 7 days a week. the 40% off anything you want whether being food or alcohol drinks is awesome! the food surprisingly is a+ with large portions ...example i ordered the mile high nachos and they were huge..only about $6 too! &nbsp;the chicken taco salad with grilled chicken was very good as well.the cherry on top were all the huge screens showing multiple sports games.only con is when it gets busy the waitresses always forgets either to bring our drinks or check up on us.. i've learned simply to go to the bar n order the drinks n bring it back to the table.
i can't say that i'd travel out of my way to get to tequila hoppers however if you're in the area it's definitely worth a stop....to my recollection, someone already commented on it however the food here is as hit or miss as the hospitality provided by their staff. i've never had a bad experience per se' but on occasion, the waitress did go into hibernation requiring me to search for someone else.the music is typically cranked up to full volume and this place has more flat screens than best buy. as someone stated as well, this place does become a club after <span class="highlighted">hours</span> (fyi) and in turn, parking can become extremely tight. aside of that they charge for everyone - regardless of your gender.the &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; prices can't be beat $2 shots, wells and appetizers). come to think of it, why am i not there ---- now?
the best nachos!!... hamburgers fantastic and the chicken teriyaki sandwich in beyond good. &nbsp;ok...so it is loud sometimes...and the waitresses dress skimpy...bikini-ish. &nbsp;but...they act very professionally and it is not uncomfortable. &nbsp;you just have to pick when you go. &nbsp;from 2:30-8 every night is <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...and everything on the menu is 50% off. &nbsp;i highly recommend the nachos....1/2 order...2 of you won't be able to finish it as a meal!!
i am a regular here &amp; i absolutely love it! i believe they have 88 beers on draft, full bar, and some of the best food i've ever had at a storts bar, all for half price during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which i might add is everyday! the only thing i noticed that i wasn't pleased with was that they were a little bias with certain individuals and they're dress code, i even witnessed then turn people away because they had jerseys on, come on folks, it's a sports bar.
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> restaurant in upland. i wish they would add more items to there menu but my favorite is the big danny burger. also like trying different beers; large selection of beers on tap and bottles. has the most tv's i've seen in any sports bar. i'm a regular so i don't get carded and the service is good. i go to hang out with friends and watch laker games.
love this place! best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around! from 2:30 - 8pm everyday! 40% off everything. during football &amp; <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, my husband and i usually get a half order of nachos (the full order is huge!), a few tacos, jalapeno poppers &amp; about 3-4 beers each and its always around $35. you cant beat that. .on friday and saturday nights they have a dj. its $5 to get in. no dress code. they have specials starting at 8pm - 40% off on all liquor - they serve food until midnight and music all night. they have a ton of beers on tap that are ice cold. big selection of food that is very good. always has a great atmosphere with mostly friendly staff. the bouncers don't tolerate much so it keeps all the bs out. our favorite server is vivian! she's awesome. always has so much energy and is so positive. definitely the best there!&amp; i say mostly friendly because there are a couple girls with pissy attitudes, very short with guests. couple weeks ago, we had issues over a sever not knowing what section she had (vivian had already gone home for the night). understandable, i'm a server. i get it. but when she finally realized it, she came to the table with &quot;what do you want?&quot; really? we sat there for 20 mins and no i'm sorry, i was busy. sorry for the wait. thanks for being patient (because we were). nothing. not even a hello! so i told her we didn't need anything anything,&amp; that we would go to the bar. i pulled a manager to the side and she was sincerely sorry. she bought us our first round and sent over a new server for us. really turned the beginning of a bad experience around. haven't had an issue since. overall, this place is great!
expensive.just your average quality pre-frozen, then nuke n serve mediocre bar food. nothing special, no inspiration.high prices on food and drink.you can do better elsewhere on food quality for less money.we bought a round for the bar that we were charged for but no one got their drinks.self-centred bartender vanished down a black hole and never came back.dated, old, oddball, shop worn tv's, no high definition.tequila hoppers website is abandon since 2010.neglected atmosphere and no energy like when absentee owners who have lost interest are trying to sell the place for more than it's worth.doubt we'll ever go back for anything more than a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special drink, then it'll only be hit and run.friendly cocktail service when / if the help sticks around.
this place has a different <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ever day and it is awesome. the service can be real good, and than it can be lame. but the prices for sure is what gets you to go back. they have &quot;security&quot;just in case. i love that they have 80 beers of draft, than they have a large amount of beers in bottles. the bar area is awesome, i've always like the way that they designed it. the have to small coin operated pool tables, and they also have darts. they have dancing friday and saturday, don't come here just for the dancing. no one really seems to come for that. cover charges for men. parking is ok. they good at keeping your empty off the tables. this place is cool for groups i also like to come watch sports here, they have a lot tvs
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing 40% off before 8, and different drink specials each night after 8! cover charge on friday and saturdays! it's gets packed pretty quick especially if there's a large sporting event that night or taco tuesday. not enough parking so get there early. pete (one of the night bartenders) is the best! he's very attentive and can hold a conversation well. i don't know many of the waitresses because i only sit at the bar but most of them seem friendly and approachable. there are a few that seem to always have a mean look on their face. best to use cash, because if you start a tab and leave a card they run it at the beginning and the end so you will have a few pending charges for about a week but only one will clear. 4 stars because i've been arrested here twice! my fault lol!
let's be serious... it is not fair to expect exceptional service and amazing atmosphere from a joint called 'tequila hoppers'. &nbsp;the name itself assumes that you go there to get fucked up. &nbsp;that is why tequila hoppers exists, and that is what i use it for.my niglet jenny and i discovered tequila hoppers years ago, and it's a bearable distance away. &nbsp;service is usually slow, regardless of how many people are in the bar. &nbsp;sometimes, you have to clean your own tables, and sometimes you have to go up to the bar to ask for things, but in all honesty i have never gotten overcharged or cheated by any waitress at tequila hoppers. &nbsp;this is not something i can say for every bar i've ever been to. i can ensure that it is almost always a spot for people watching.the food isn't half bad. &nbsp;the crunchy, greasy bar foods we all know and love are especially good. &nbsp;try the chili-cheese curly fries, cream cheese jalepeno poppers and good old quasi-mexican bar foods. &nbsp;a new discovery by my favorite jenny - - downright amazing fish and chips. &nbsp;who knew??!!??!!don't go there on a date!don't go there to see and be seen!don't dress up and pretend like it's a club!don't pay cover and complain about it - you could have just left!go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, get everything half off and just get over it. &nbsp;the last time jenny and i went and hung out for about 4 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of laughing, gossiping and drinking for less than $20 each! &nbsp;it's a bargain. &nbsp;and sometimes god comes to us lowly humans and tell us that we can go drink totally alkie-satisfying amounts for totally economic-downturn prices if we're willing to not sweat the small stuff. &nbsp;so if you really think about it, through the magic of tequila hoppers 7-day a week, every-single-freaking-item half off <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, god is making us <span class="highlighted">happy</span> and teaching us important life lessons.damn, that's deep.
this place was one of the first places i was exposed to when i turned 21 and its stuck on me for a few years. &nbsp;back in the day my friends and i used to roll there 2x sometimes 3x a week when i was still in college. &nbsp;in 2005 i'd say tequila hoppers was a good fun place to hang out at, it was consistently crowded, drink prices are good, and the dj's were better. &nbsp;now in 2010 it's gone way down, the place looks scummy, high cover charges and they charge on thursdays! (maybe used to, i don't know now) &nbsp;the patrons are just as the other yelpers say .. not the greatest crowd to hang out with. &nbsp;after expanding my spots over the years, tequila hoppers is definitely not on my top lists of spots to go to at night.pros: -<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 7 days a week, great for an afternoon outing-nightly drink specials apply right after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>-two large projection screens for sportscons:-high cover charges on certain nights, there are way more options locally than tequila hoppers and many who are cheaper than $10 and some don't even charge a cover-very slow service at times, messy tables-bouncers who think they're hard-staff neglects to mention when specials are off based sporting events and time, it's one of those things you have to already know
i have come here only during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for football season or hockey (go kings!!!) and i always have a great time. all the sandwiches/burgers i've ordered are good. the appetizers are eh nothing too special...could be better. i feel like they are the frozen ones you could buy at any market. service depends on the waitress. i've had great service days and horrible service days. the first time i came i asked about the bottled beer selection and the waitress told me they had everything, so i ordered an asahi. &nbsp;she quickly notified me that they don't carry asahi. haha. i guess they really don't carry everything then! i still come regardless of their service off days to hang with friends and watch some hockey and football. i love that they have several tvs everywhere so you can watch your game or catch another sport. they also have a huge movie screen with sound playing the most important games. during football season, they give out raffle tickets with every purchase for a tv that's raffled at the end of the game. during hockey season they have a 40% off everything <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...over 80 beers on tap! &nbsp;we got a pitcher of our current fav, hangar 24 ipa. &nbsp;food was above average for bar food. &nbsp;got a half order of nachos (but you would never believe it's half) with chicken and beef, next time it will be just chicken. &nbsp;nothing wrong with the beef but the chicken was way better. &nbsp;we both got a burger, fries &amp; onion rings. &nbsp;burgers and fries were ok but the onion rings were fantastic...i got mine extra crispy. &nbsp;tvs plaster all the walls, you could easily watch 4 games without shifting your eyes! &nbsp;there are also pool tables and dart boards...and the place turns into a dance club at night but i can't comment on that.all in all, i will definitely come back...and recommend to friends!
i had my 21st bday party here and it was going well but then as time passed we were waiting on our food for like an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> the waitress was kinda taking awhile and the workers/manager were very rude!!! my friend who came the same night told me that the waitress had taken $20 from her and she has a receipt to prove it and she had confronted the manager and she did not even look them in the eye basically the bouncer was talking for her. i mean that's not the bouncers business to talk for the manager that's her title for a damn reason! any way i just think if u come to this place make sure they don't rip you off be aware of what your spending! as for drinks they had nearly everything good specials and deals when it comes to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> alone warrants 3 stars. the beer is good, 75 cent tacos. good place after work when you're broke and just looking for a couple beers and some cheap (but yummy) tacos.i went once on a saturday night cuz i heard it &quot;turns into&quot; a club. i don't know what kind of 'club' it turned into, but it was pretty skank. and i say that in the most flattering way possible.first thing i noticed - lots of big girls. i'm a big girl myself, so i notice these things. super hood crowd, lots of gangbangers with their baby mamas. the dance floor is small, made smaller by the large girls who frequent it. the dress code seems to be ghetto fabulous (light on the fabulous) and you will get pat down heavily by the bouncers.the outside patio is probably the best asset. $10 cover is entirely too much for what they're offering.if you're a big girl - you'll feel very comfortable here.if you're a guy who likes big girls - consider this a buffet.
expensive cover for ufc ($10 a person)good atmosphere, but most only seemed interested at the main event.food, ordered from best to worst. &nbsp;buffalo wings were actually pretty good.mile high nachos are decent, better than the chilli fries.calimari. &nbsp;bad bad bad.zuccini sticks, equally bad.drinks:<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on beer are pretty good, prices seem a bit high otherwise (eg.. $24 pitcher)pina colada apparently was terrible, low alcohol, and was chunky chunky ice, not well blended at all, maybe it was made with a hammer instead of a blender.service. &nbsp;courteous waitresses, but slow, and never came back to check on table or refill water.overall, food wasn't good, and cover was high... won't be back, 2 1/2 stars
i think this place has one the best <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> i have ever been to....ever. the music is actually decent. &nbsp;food is good however there is one problem that i have with them. i ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and i asked for a pickle. what a suprise when i looked at my bill and i was charged a $1 for my 1 pickle. the waitress never informed of it but and was shocked to see it because i'd never thought i'd see a charge for it. i asked the waitress why? she said because of the recession that they charge for all add ones like pickles, lettuce, onions, etc. i am not cheap by all means but damn really. luckily the food was actually good!
i may as well be considered a regular here. i have celebrated my birthday there twice as well as all of my friends. if we're not celebrating a birthday we are just chilling. as many of you have mentioned, the service is a hit or miss. there is one &quot;waitress&quot; there who is all around terrible.. not sure her name, i just know her by her terrible amanda bynes-esque extensions. avoid avoid avoid her tables at all costs. there drinks are priced about average for a bar, beware the cut off time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, there were a couple times where we lost track of time and wound up with a couple hundred dollar bill! our fault, would of appreciated a heads up for the cut off but oh well.tv's galore!---need i say more?when it is a nightclub you can expect an array of music from old school hip hop/r&amp;b to todays current hits mixed decently. if you get there early enough you don't have to pay to get in but really who wants to get there at 4pm??make sure you try the buffalo strip nugget things! they are probably swanson brand that you can buy anywhere but with a nice cold beer and a vat of ranch for dipping you are in sport watching heaven!
i really wanted to like this place! the outside looks so pretty! and tequila is myyyyy poison of choice! as soon as i walk in, i hear &quot;jump, jump&quot; bumpin' on the speakers. &nbsp;nice! old skool...i like it. the bouncer looked mean but i guess that is their job. plus, i always enjoy getting carded (now!). then we went to the bar area and it was open seating. the waitress took a long time to take our order and not many people were there. they have a greaaaat variety of beers. and i think they are half-off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they also had 0.75 cent wings! woooot woooot! i order 10! well, they came back all soaked in bbq sauce. the waitress also tempted us with a $2 shot. i think it was called a sunset something...it was quite delicious and it didn't taste like it had any alcohol (but those are the worst kind...) they also have pool tables which looked like fun from afar. all in all, the food wasn't too great, the service was slow, and i also heard that fights break out a lot. but it looks soooo nice from the outside! come on, upland! can we feel the love?
had an awsome time tequila hoppers bar and grill inc. last night. they have some new beers on the menu, and our favorite waitress, mary, was anxious for us to sample them. our favorite, peanutbutter stout. this is truly one of the best beers i've had in a while. gives dale bros brewery's mango shandy a run for it's money, although they are two different breeds intirely, to be fair. their food is fantastic. &nbsp;if you're looking for a burger, this is it! &nbsp;try their mushroom burger, bbq burger or bourbon burger, you can't go wrong! &nbsp;they also have the best onion rings around, and their pizza is good. &nbsp;their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals can't be beat. &nbsp;40% off. &nbsp;it's what got us in there, and we keep going back. &nbsp;if there are large sporting events, there may be a cover charge, so that's a downer when you're just looking for an early dinner and some drinks. mary is the best of the best when it come to servers! &nbsp;she always remembers us and what types of beer we like.
i am old and married and way past my bar hopping/clubbing days...plus i am a mom....so why, you ask did i enter this place....well, i'll tell ya. the sign outside said buy one get one free lunch entree from noon to 2:00. hubs and i were hungry...and intrigued so we went in...at like 1:00 p.m. on a saturday...seriously, we increased the population of the bar 100%.to say it was dead is an understatement....hubs had a burger and fries and two beers - bass. i had a steak sandwich with onion rings. hubs' burger was huge and really good....my sandwich was just enh...but the onion rings were really good. we paid like $ 20.00 with tip. however, 1/2 way thru our meal a couple came in...must have been tweakers....they had that pocked face, fidgety way about them....had no teeth and looked like they just rolled in from mississippi.....total white trash...then it gets better.....they were dixie loving, in bred freaks all tatted up with white pride tats. classy.so, while i have no idea about what <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or the 'club' (i use that term loosely)is like....the lunch special was good, the tweakers were free entertainment....so, if you are bored to tears or hung over and need a greasy meal and cheap beers to get over the hang over hump.....plus to see either inbred jed and his sister/wife or some gang bangers....check this place out.

i love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here the staff is really nice and there side table guacamole is so good. i recomend there tropical sunrise.
came in with my friend during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a sunday. server was great paid great attention and right away as soon as we sat made us aware of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. my friend and i were here for couple of <span class="highlighted">hours</span> enjoying a chat and we were still receiving great customer service. definitely will come here more often
get there before the rush.. we went at 1130 on sunday.. bar had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! whoo hooo!! amazing service and i love the layout of this chili's!! &nbsp;ok chili's is not my first choice of places to go.. but this new one in the colonies is super nice and i love the dinner for 2 for 20. &nbsp;whoo hoo
of all the chain restaurants in the area, my circle of friends are drawn to this one. i'm a fan of the strong margaritas, especially the presidente. if only they'd leave the bottle of tequila on the table, i'd never leave.for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> this place is great. get yourself a beer, a queso skillet and a good friend. the bartenders are typcially friendly. this location tends to attract mall flys, that is, employees from the neighboring montclair plaza. here is another place where i had a star sighting: pamela anderson with her boys. cute mama in person, for real.for dinner, there's no place better for a steak. oops! not sure if i should be ordering a steak medium-rare in front of my vegan friend, but i think she anticipates it. this past weekend we had with a very cute balloon boy who made star a butterfly. i think she named it flyey.the following night we arrive for late-nite drinks, but were told that they close at 10:30 pm on sunday. really? this is why i hate the ie. the bartender was nice enough to suggest another bar. hmm? i wonder if corporate would be <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to hear that.
corner-pub-ontario
do not judge a book by it's cover. this a great little bar to kick back and relax at. don't bother asking the bartender for drink specials/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, because it's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day with the best prices in town. there is always a mixed crowd, and they welcome everyone. i love playing darts here with the locals. stop in and have a few!
i have been coming to this bar since i was 21. if you like good friendly staff and dive bars this is the place to come. if you are just flying in ontario international or business. or you just need a beer after work. there really is no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but all drinks are priced greatly.
this bar very close to home, but besides that, the bar has a set of regulars whom are very nice people. i enjoy stopping in for just one or for a few. the pool tables and darts are a positive addition to the bar. they even have people/customers bring in food for special occasions which makes it even a better place to visit! i love the senior citizen staff here! reminds me of my grampa!i suck at pooldon't finish your drink before you order another!ryan is bartending so gunna be a good nite... well till 10:58...gotta be home before she gets off work.$0.50 pool and $2.25 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beer!oh yeah gotta cold glass...disregard the previous tip!don't give the bartender an empty glass, cuz he will use it again &amp; againturn a/c on and serve me my drink!walk here and u won't get hurtclose to home! if u ride a bike the will lock it up in the back.
applebees-montclair
good place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> good selection of beers good appetizers as well. best night would be wensday karaoke nights
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was cool... service was prompt at the bar. she was nice and super attentive about our drinks. basically as soon as i was finished with my beer, she offered to give me another. this was really nice but i feel like i spent more than i meant to (lol).
first off this place is lame to come to for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and second we didn't get ask what beverages we wanted to for a good 20 mins we sat down on top of that the food sucked
went in for late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> friday night, 5/15/15. the male bartender was quick, attentive, and non-intrusive. great service. strangely, there wasn't a bro to be seen anywhere, something ubiquitous with applebee's. not a single angel's or dodger's cap. it was very nice and pleasant. i am not giving it five stars because the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> appetizer of spinach artichoke dip is noticeably smaller than the regular menu. i'm sure it's smarter for me to have a smaller portion, but i want to feel like a disgusting animal from eating appetizers: not a calorie-conscious person.
food was apple bees good, but something was pretty off tonight at this location :/came here late night about 10pm. we were &nbsp;greeted by 2 hostess and asked what type of seating. i asked if there's a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and one of them said &quot;yeah we have a dinner special!&quot;. so yay! and self seating at the bar. me and my partner assumed the high tables too, but then they stopped us saying that they only have 3 servers, 1 in each section (booths/tables, and high tops in bar area). we decided to wait for high top since we wanted <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food.finally got to our table and our server was a sweetheart. i asked where's their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special foods and she replied there's none. so the hostess deceive me :/ and worse she had an impatient attitude. since it was only 3 servers tonight, service was pretty slow but our waitress was still sweet and smiley.what makes this whole night a mess is that they are clearly understaffed of waiters on a saturday night. i don't know their logic, but it's saturday! how can you not have more servers? i know the economy is just okay, but it doesn't mean downgrade on service, especially when it's thur-sat with great chances of many people dining and enjoying the night life.i'm very wary of returning to this location for dinner.
came here for sunday dinner with the family and the service was great! our waitress was very attentive and made sure to check on us regularly. the food came out in a timely fashion and the manager even swung by to make sure everything was good at our table. this location also has great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
9 o'clock <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!! how can you go wrong!!!! 3 dollar domestics and 3 dollar mixed drinks(they have like 6 for you to chose). well worth it.. and honey bbq wings uber bomb
i go here once in a while...always good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>... went here today for take out tonight...got some shrimp weight watcher meal...closed out at bar...curbside closes at 9pm...hey when there is nothing else to get semi healthy late night...definitely can hit up the weight watcher menu...yum

super small place, so you wont have a seat on a weekend, unless you get there pretty early. the drinks are poured pretty stiff, but nothing real fancy about this place, and it isnt &quot;dive bar&quot; cheap. the food is pretty good, nothing great. definitely better mid-week for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. not horrible though, and my wife really likes it. i've been about 10 times, and im sure we will go another 10 through out the years.
tj mccutchins has a sports bar atmosphere with better than average bar food. &nbsp;jd salingers has a little bit of outdoor seating and one flatscreen outside.jg wentworth's has lots of daily specials.one of my favorite daily <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials at aj spumoni's is the sliders.on slider night at pd eastman's they have a fixin's bar.come to think of it, at hr puff n' stuffs they may have the fixin's bar all the time.we have been here to mj tolkein's probably 5 or 6 times and my wife still calls it something different every time, hence the many references to kd burelli's.anyway, look for upscale bar food and sports bar atmosphere at jk rowling's!
this place is okay. i work in the area and always passed by the place so i stopped in. first thing i noticed the minute i walked through the door was a weird smell that overwhelmed the place. didn't smell like a certain type of food or burnt food it smelled more like wet clothes lol but x10. like a weird smell like that. like clothes have been sitting out for a while. i was like whatever. sat down at a table and soon the smell was gone cause i got used to it. anyway i went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but skipped on a decent drink selection and ordered a chicken caesar salad with water. food was really good, i love chicken salads and this one was yummy. the place is kinda small but it's not awful. it's hard to get your server when you need her sometimes cause she has like every table in the place but she was friendly. i probably would go back but not as a first pick place to eat. the smell really turned me off, it was really bad. but the food made up for it.
j.d.'s is a little bar in downtown upland. kinda small but the bar seats about 10 and there are 5-10 little tables plus outside patio seating. when the lemon festival comes to town in late april the patio is prime real estate. it boasts a full bar with reasonable prices and a decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the food is surprisingly good.
this place wants to be your neighborhood go-to bar.walking in, i first noticed the open kitchen, then the l-shaped bar that seats maybe 15 people, and plenty of tvs for the sports fanatic. &nbsp;it seems like a cross between an upscale sports bar, lounge, and a california pizza kitchen with all the contemporary amenities.we sat ourselves at an open table. &nbsp;our server seemed really dedicated to her job. &nbsp;service was curt and she didn't seem like she wanted to chit-chat as we asked her why the old baldy brewery next door closed down, but didn't get an answer. &nbsp; we ordered pomona queen, which is similar to a killian's red, on draft. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> run from 3-7pm and each of our pints cost about $3.79.we were in luck as they had $1 tacos yesterday. &nbsp;you tell your server how many tacos everyone can eat, she gives you tickets, then you take it to the guy serving tacos at the kitchen counter. &nbsp;there are also plenty of hot sauces, cilantro, onions, tomatoes, salsa, and other condiments for your &nbsp;tacos. &nbsp;you have to hurry as last call for tacos end around 8pm, but varies because the sign says, &quot;$1 taco tuesdays! &nbsp;3pm - ?&quot; &nbsp;ooh. &nbsp;the question mark makes it so mysterious like party invitations.tuesdays - $1 taco night (tiny 3&quot; diameter tortillas)wednesdays - karaoke nightfriday - djsaturday - live music

love this place. the house pan roast(mild) is my favorite! they have blue point oysters at a really good price. staff is friendly. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is pretty awesome too!
been here several times now, and we still like it. &nbsp;we like it even more now that they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> since they have clam chowder and their calamari on the menu. &nbsp;the clam chowder is really good, and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> portions are filling. &nbsp;the oysters, which are also on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, taste fresh. &nbsp;good service, too. &nbsp;from their regular menu, we love the pan roast.
this place never lets me down. &nbsp;food is always good. &nbsp;with food this good, it is very satisfying. &nbsp;give the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu a try. &nbsp;none of it disappoints.
i love this place! i went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and started off with the bacon wrapped shrimp and crab cakes. both were delicious and came out really fast. i ordered the jambalaya with a spice level of 7, it wasn't that spicy i'll probably up it to an 8 the next time i go. there was tons of shrimp and andouille
love this place! the pan roasts are amazing...i made the mistake of ordering my gumbo really spicy and i wasn't able to enjoy it. the management is great and the staff is really friendly. i love the appetizer sampler that they have during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>..their sausages are amazing. it's kind of pricey but its worth it every now and then. if you like spicy, this is a good place to go. it's never too crowded. try going during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>..they have great deals. it may not look like a lot of food at first but i never finish it! great place.
gumbo was good-the base was thicker than we've had before. shrimp scampi with linguine was great and you can choose hotness and add and take things out to make it just who you like it! &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> til 6pm so they have great oyster shooters for $3(2).
my husband and i have only been here for dinner. their dinner portions are huge and more than enough for you to share. they also have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials during the beginning of their dinner <span class="highlighted">hours</span>.i would recommend their house pan roast if you enjoy seafood and the calamari appetizer.
had the louisiana oysters on the half shell for an appetizer... on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. awesome, huge meaty oysters served with lemon, cocktail sauce and horseradish. 2 oysters for 3 bucks. niiice. had the house pan roast... and it was... amazing. big pieces of seafood, delicious sauce. it was a hefty portion, couldn't finish it all, so brought the rest home with me. my server, myra (i think) was great.i'll definitely be back.
everytime i come here i always order the same thing cilantro chicken and sausage #4. i'm not a big fan of the too spicy ones. they hve <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> at 4pm to 6pm. the crab cakes are a must try. it is really good. i have tried almost everything on the menu from my boyfriend's plate. they aren't too bad too. they are actually pretty good. the service is always very good here.
great service - happened to show up at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the good news - a small selection of beer on draft. &nbsp;too bad the appetizer jalepeno poppers tasted of raw flour breading. &nbsp;pan roast was good as the rice portion was not too big.
they have amazing food here. my all time favorite is the house pan roast and it is just amazing. i've tried a few of there entrees but i always come back to hpr. the service here is great. the staff is very attentive. also if its your first time here, sit at the counter its always a cool experience. you can see how the chefs make the dishes. they also have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials as well, try the crab cakes and calamari.
its from the chef that worked at palace station oyster bar and the pan roasts remind us exactly of the palace station but the place is cleaner and when we went no wait so thats cool too. they also have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on some select apps and beer.
i went on a monday evening. there were not that many people which was fine, no wait! had the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> calamari and pan roast. the calamari was like biting into a cheesestick. nice thick portions of squid with just enough batter crunch. the pan roast was ok. i thought it was too rich after a few bites on its own. it had a good amount of shrimp and lobster. the rice that accompanied it was so small. an extra bowl costs over $1.50. thats outrageous! not sure if id go back for the price is not worth the food.
the food here is amazing. i used to be one of the cooks here for a while. every dish here is good. it all depends on what you feel like eating.for appetizers the bacon wrap shrimp and oyster rockefellers i definitely recommend.for the entrees i personally think the jambalaya, house pan roast and gumbo are the top 3. for dessert i would recommend the creme brulee and bread pudding.they also have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials m-f 5pm-6:30pm
kettle cooked seafoodfood is good but i feel a bit pricey. &nbsp;the dinner pricing is around $15-$25 for an entree. &nbsp;lunch is cheaper and they have an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.everything comes in a bowl which means they are &quot;soupy&quot; in everything they serve. &nbsp;gumbo, jambalaya, chicken and sausage w/ noodle soup, house pan roast (which is like a chowder) etc.house pan roast: &nbsp;in a creamy tomato based chowder (heavy in the cream) with bits of crab meat, lobster, shrimp and clams very delicious! &nbsp;they were not shy about the portions of crab and lobster which i appreciated very much.linguini w/ clam white sauce: &nbsp;it looked sort of like soup there were a lot of white wine butter sauce in the bowl but it too was yummy.i'd say go there for a special occasion but too expensive for my budget these days. &nbsp;next time i'll hit up the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> =)staff were attentive and nice. &nbsp;place was crowded. &nbsp;sit at the bar if you want to be entertained, the chef cooks in steam kettles in front of you!
my friends and i dub this place, the best restaurant in the 909 because quite frankly, it is.i have been here on weekends and week days for dinner and there is usually not a wait. &nbsp;but one time i was here and it was packed, that has not happened since.it is a quaint little restaurant with table seating and bar seating. &nbsp;i always get the house pan roast. &nbsp;it is a thick seafood broth with a tomato base. &nbsp;they don't give you very much rice, which is unfortunate, but they give you unlimited french bread that can be used to be dipped into the broth. &nbsp;the bread soaks it all up and it is amazing.i also enjoy the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i believe it is from 4-6:30 pm, i believe even on weekends, but i am not 100% sure. &nbsp;i have had the sausage, it is not that great in my opinion, i wouldn't use my money on that dish. &nbsp;my go to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items are the 2 oysters on the half shell for $3 and the clam chowder! &nbsp;the must get here is the house pan roast!
we love coming to dinner here. we avoid the rush and get there early. sitting at the bar is the best. the chefs talk to you explain what's in the dishes and how it is cooked, they are all friendly. &nbsp;the food .... yummy! when they have the fresh clams in white wine sauce get it! they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu top picks the oysters rockefeller , and chowder. we always order the house pan roast! amazing!!! finish off the dinner with a creme br&ucirc;l&eacute;e ...
i love the setting of this restaurant. at first, the bar seating looked a bit intimidating. but as i sat down, i realized i had made a mistake not sitting there to watch the chef work his magic!<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=h7cpcnckbduhdtxqfzhmya&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>the service here was superb. they don't have a huge menu, which i love! but being first timers, there were endless questions. what is the most popular dish? which is your top choice? how spicy is spicy? what do you mean it's still <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>?!?!?<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3xtxqf7mgmmoeehcgatazg&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>we got there just in time before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended so we had to take advantage. the prices are about $1 off regular price, so we ordered clam chowder (yum), scallops, and the bacon wrapped shrimp.<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lafixac2zuf8ltzcom15-q&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>and let me tell you about these babies, they are absolutely to die for! i'm not the biggest fan of bacon nor cheese, but when you put them together with shrimp... you get a master symphony of incredible bursting inside your mouth. i would go back just for these suckers.i ordered the house pan roast, which is mixed seafood swimming in a tomato stew.<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_4-ilqvfujt-m8fp2tx4hq&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>my friend ordered the jambalaya, which i thought was quite delicious. he goes over the top with spice, so his level 6 spicy was bearable to me, which meant it did no damage to his taste buds. but luckily, the waitress came over with an extra side of spice to save the day.<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bofj2e9gofcfbsagpdkh2a&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>
my mom took me and a few other family members here. we ate dinner here before going to my brother's marching band competition at ayala high school. my mom and dad have been here before and really liked the place. this place really reminded me of ritter's steam kettle cooking. we got there earlier than a couple people of our party so we ordered our drinks and appetizers. our server was nice and helpful. i got their iced green tea to drink. we were there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so we got their crab cakes and jalapeno poppers. the crab cakes were really good, big, plump and filled with a lot of crab. there were also some chopped peppers in onion in there too. the jalepeno poppers were hot, fresh and not too spicy. the cream cheese inside was piping hot. it's best to eat their poppers with a fork and knife. my mom ate it like finger food and it ended up exploding in her face. so be careful with those. when the rest of our party arrived we ordered our entrees. my mom and i split a caesar salad and their famous pan roast. the salad was really good, but caesar salad is my favorite anyways. it didn't have too much dressing and was topped with a generous helping of parmesan cheese. the pan roast was good too. we got it level five spicy which proved to be just a little too much spice for me, but the white rice helped cool it down. it was creamy, thick and had lots of treasures from the sea. my mom said it was a little too sweet for her liking, but i think the sweetness balanced out the spice really well. we skipped out on dessert because we had to leave and they didn't have beignets. they should really serve some beignets. this place was really good though, i'm glad my parents found this place.
finally, i don't have to drive all the way to las vegas to get a good pan roast!the staff here is very friendly, chef ritter is a great guy and easy to talk to. &nbsp;he comes straight from las vegas where he used to dish the pan roast at palace station where i used to have to go to satisfy my fix.the food is great here. &nbsp;the pan roast i thought was a little more seafooody than i remember, but its still good. &nbsp;i suggest getting the rice on the side instead of in the pan roast. &nbsp;the clam chowder is to die for, get the biggest bowl possible!! &nbsp;this place also has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and lunch sized/priced portions. &nbsp; will come back here again!
so after our annual vegas trip and trying oyster bar in palace station for the first time, i started craving the pan roast about a week later. &nbsp;so i started searching for a similar meal in my area. &nbsp;i found the boiler on yelp and was excited to see good reviews. &nbsp;so my gf and i decided to come on a sunday after church and was sort of perplexed to find the restaurant almost empty. &nbsp;it was around 3pm i think, so i wasn't expecting it to be packed, but there were maybe 2-3 tables and maybe 3-4 people at the bar total.either way, we sat down and noticed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and ordered up some beer, &nbsp;fries, oysters, and a house pan roast. &nbsp; i was a bit disappointed by the beer selection but whatever. &nbsp;the cajun fries were delicious. &nbsp;i love fries, especially seasoned fries, and these were spicy which i love as well. &nbsp;the oysters were good, not as fresh as oyster bar in vegas but still good. &nbsp;the rockefeller oysters were baked and came out piping hot but delicious. &nbsp;we enjoyed the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals for a pair of oysters and a discounted price. finally, the house pan roast. &nbsp;we ordered it at spiciness level 8. &nbsp;that was slightly disappointing as it was not spicy at all (for me). &nbsp;however, the flavor profile of the pan roast was pretty close to oyster bar, it just had less seafood which i expected based on the yelp reviews. &nbsp;anyways, everything was pretty good, service was good, food was good. &nbsp;i did go again a few weeks ago and it was actually better this time. &nbsp;we ordered the combo pan roast with sausage this time and it was better and had more seafood.
as if this place couldn't get any better... last week when i was there (sunday afternoon), they were offering <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! my anchor steam draft beer was $3! they also had appetizers on the hh menu, but we already ordered our hearty meals. i will be prepared next time - a 3 mile run before the boiler, so there's no excuse not to get tasty beer, creole sausage appetizer, and bouillabaisse!!
my wife and i came here for the first time last tuesday evening and we were very pleased. we arrived and were cheerfully greeted and promptly seated. we took advantage of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials and ordered a couple of house pinot grigios, crab cakes and bacon wrapped shrimp. all were delicious. for the main course my wife ordered the gumbo and i ordered the pan roast. both were well executed and available cooked to your level of spiciness. there was however something lacking in the seasonings as other yelpers have noted. as the servings are large, we had some to take home. the next day, we added a blend of cajun spices we keep on hand and that was the cat's meow! i would have given a 5 star rating if not for this lack of proper seasoning. we will be back but next time, we're bringing our seasoning to supplement theirs.
went here the other day and it's only gotten better! ^_^ i'm so glad business is hoppin'.house pan roast was perfect! gumbo was perfect! oysters were delicious! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is cool with cheap appetizers! i love being able to try something new, especially when it doesn't cost a fortune, just in case i don't like it. ^_~ they were all good, two different kinds of sausage with neat dipping sauces, and the calamari was made from crazy 1&quot; thick humbolt squid! i don't know if chef ritter went out to catch it himself or not, but it was super fresh! :dthe waitresses need to step up their game. maybe they need to stop worrying about who's table is who's and concentrate on checking on their customers. good thing great food always overshadows mediocre service in my book! ^_^
i have to start by saying that i took a trip to new orleans for the first time last year and it changed my view on food forever ... primarily the technique of well infused spices into dishes, especially cajun style seafood - so really everything ever since then has been compared to how well nola did it. &nbsp; &nbsp;we came around 545 on a sunday night right before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended at 600 pm and were still able to &nbsp;catch all the <span class="highlighted">happy</span> deals on drinks and small dishes (how lucky were we?!). &nbsp;so taking advantage of the deals, we loaded up on starters and tried as many little dishes as possible ... there were a couple others i would have tried (like the oysters and crab cakes and mussels) but for the sake of being greedy ... &nbsp;there's always next time! &nbsp;for starters we tried:-cajun calamari: huge portion, good crunch, not your average calamari rings - comes in long strips -new england clam chowder: creamy with a peppery kick, just the way i like it! -bacon wrapped shrimp: bacon was too crunchy, almost burnt, but shrimp was perfectly cooked-jalapeno poppers - you really can't go wrong with jalapeno poppers ... cheesy and spicy and yum!as far as main dishes were concerned, i was able to sample the seafood gumbo and the etouffee and i enjoyed both. &nbsp;both seafood dishes were well prepared, spices were well infused, and overall both were well ... tasty! the seafood gumbo came complete with okra, shrimp, crab, clams and andouille sausage served over rice in a deeply flavored stew. &nbsp;the etouffee was lighter and tomato-y with shrimp and crawfish ... yum. &nbsp;we were seated around the kitchen/bar area ... it was fun to watch dishes being prepared right in front of us.tips? come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so you can sample as much as you can ... and cheap beer is always a plus ... duh! and, as suggested by a friend, only order one main dish and share ... the portions are huge - feeds enough for two people! &nbsp;if you like spicy, don't be afraid to go spicy - &nbsp;level 5 was not enough for me ... next time i'll try a 7!it's no new orleans ... but good enough! i will be back.
mmmm mmmm mmmmmmm!! this place is delicious! my friend told me about this place after i told her i've been wanting to try the oyster bar in vegas. and omg. bomb. i went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (5-6:30pm &amp; i believe it's m-f). i got the 2 oysters for $3. they were huge! tasted fresh &amp; yummy. and i also ordered the house pan roast. ermahgerdddd. so. freakin. delicious. i felt like i was scarfing down my dish because i was eating it super fast. it was so good. it's $19.55 for dinner. kinda pricey but def worth it! it's a tomato cream based dish w/ lobster, shrimp, clams, veggies, i forgot what else, &amp; a scoop of rice. if i didn't love to eat i would be able to share but no thanks, i want my own :) lol. anyways get the house pan roast next time! you will not regret it!
my husband &amp; i absolutely love this place and dine here often. &nbsp;not only is the food incredible, but the chefs (tony, chris, jimmy) and staff are friendly and eager to please. &nbsp;we have tried many things on the menu, but our absolute favorites are the bouillebasse, house pan roast and fisherman's soup (white clam chowder soup on steroids). &nbsp;the appetizers are also great (e.g. cajun calamari, blue point oysters, bacon wrapped shrimp). &nbsp;i would definitely recommend hitting the restaurant at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so that you can take advantage of the discounts and sit at the bar so that you can watch the varied preparations. &nbsp;we love it here and plan to return often!!!!
hmm not sure how i feel about this place yet. i didn't enjoy it as much as oyster bar in las vegas but one thing i do like compared to vegas is more seating!! the bar seats about 15-20 people and there are about 10-15 other tables surrounding. same feel as vegas with the bar set-up. i came for dinner so the house pan roast (mixed seafood) was $19.95, cesar salad $5.50 and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> crab cakes $4.75. our total came out to $38 with a 18% tip. prices here are about the same - however they do have different lunch and dinner pricing - i suggest coming for lunch when dishes are about $5-$7 less!i typically eat mild but ordered a #6 for my pan roast- watch out - dare devil over here!!! :p - it was a little spicy for my liking. the pan roast wasn't as creamy with more of a marinara taste here then vegas. the food wasn't bad here, service was good. defintiely something to try out before you go to oyster bar. i set my expectations too high..
amazing seafood gumbo!!!thank you yelpers for pointing out the way to this place! &nbsp;we came on a saturday just in time for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which highlighted a few appetizers on the cheap. &nbsp;i decided i wanted something to warm me up and curious about their new england clam chowder and boy was it reminiscent of the one i had while i was in boston. &nbsp;it was delicious.i will keep this short.ordered the seafood gumbo and when our server was explaining what was involved in the preparation of their gumbo, including a 4-5 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> stock, i was drooling. &nbsp;when my dish was served, the smell the emanated was amazing. &nbsp;you can smell all the spices and the seafood that it had and it was delicious. &nbsp;it had real crab meat shredded, pealed shrimp, clams and a heaping of rice. &nbsp;i decided to take it easy and went with number 3 for spiciness and i was very <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. &nbsp;in the future i think i can take it up to maybe a 5 but that will be pushing it for me. &nbsp;the dish had so much flavor that you can actually take apart. &nbsp;the texture was thick but it didn't feel heavy like it was made out of cream. &nbsp;that would be their pan roast.service was a little more on the slow side. &nbsp;seeing how they prepare using the steam kettle, it does take some time to prepare their dishes. &nbsp;but it was definitely worth the wait.
cajun fries must try (different take on what normally fries would be).. had there jalapeno poppers which had the thickest and crunchiest batter i ever had (pure awesome). i ordered the &quot;gumbo&quot; which included huge pieces of shrimp, fish, sausage, okra and other shiznits i don't know about. full robust flavor, wonderful aromatics and everything u would want @ a really really good bayou restaurant except its in chino hills. no 5 stars cigar because... service really really i mean really slow. i suggest go during lunch time (before 3 pm) because come dinner time, the prices jump like $5 or 6 dollars.. on the flip side, if you get there between 4-6 (dinner time) <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and get your brewski (bottle) for $2.50..
two words pan roast! after venturing out into the oc with fellow yelper juliet c. to ritter's, we have been dying to try more steam kettle cooking. so after we learned that chef ritter used to work at the boiler in chino we decided to drop by for dinner earlier this week.when we arrived the wait was only about 10 minutes which was a pleasant surprise since it was labor day. we compared the menu to the menu at ritter's and realized that the prices at the boiler was slightly cheaper and they even have a reduced pricing for lunch. although, after ordering our food we also noticed that the portion sizes were also slightly less so you might actually be getting more bang for your buck at ritter's. since i enjoyed my clam pan roast at ritter's so much i decided to order the same thing again. juliet ordered the house gumbo. we didn't want to go too spicy so i stuck with a level 5 and juliet chose a level 4. overall, i felt that my pan roast tasted pretty much the same in comparison to ritter's. i also really enjoyed the complimentary bread which i used to dip into the pan roast which soaked up all the flavor. i also tried some of juliet's gumbo, but i felt that it was nowhere as good as the pan roast. the texture of the gumbo was thick and had the consistency of gravy. it also tasted a bit watered down so we assumed it was because the spice level was too low. i'll definitely come back again to try their lunch special pricing and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
shanon y. and i wanted to try this place after our amazing visit to ritter's skc in oc! chef ritter used to work at the boiler and i believe he played a vital role in starting the business, as well. in comparison, i would still prefer ritter's because it's newer and chef ritter himself actually works there, but admittedly, the boiler is still pretty damn legit. the wait to get seated was about 10-15 mins. shan and i came for dinner on labor day. get the pan roast!! i will be ordering that from now on after sampling shanon's dish (she ordered the clam pan roast). i was curious about the gumbo, so decided to order that. it was definitely good, but not nearly as delicious as the pan roast! my seafood gumbo had a gravy like taste and the consistency of a thick stew. on a spiciness level of 1 through 10, i asked for 4, but it wasn't spicy at all; not in the least bit. if anything, i would have wanted more flavor! however, the seafood was really good and the dish was tasty. it just could have been even better. shanon's dish was....amazing! taste was comparable to the pan roast at ritter's skc!! the portion sizes at the boiler are a bit smaller than ritter's, but the overall prices are a bit cheaper too. heard this place has good lunch specials and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 6pm, so i def need to check it out again soon!service was great! our waitress's name was destiny and she did a spectacular job. she was so sweet and so efficient!
amazing food! this is one of my favorite places. too bad they're so far away.came here for dinner with the boyfriend before eminem's concert.we walked in at around 5 and the place was pretty empty. it was a pretty hot day though, i would say like 100 degrees.we sat down at the bar. the head chef (never got his name) was super nice! he asked if it was our first time &amp; we said yes, he brought us out a cup of clam chowder to try. it was so delicious!! yummm my boyfriend isn't really big on seafood but he enjoyed it.we ordered the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> appetizer sampler.i ordered the house pan roast and the boyfriend ordered the cioppino.we got our sampler which had bacon wrapped shrimp, spring rolls, and sausages (we ordered the loiusiana sausage). all 3 appetizers were delicious! yummmmmmwhile we enjoyed our appetizer, the chef started to prepare our entrees using the kettle, it was fun to watch.our food was ready once we finished our sampler.my house pan roase was delicious! it comes with jasmine rice. words cant describe how good the pan roast is. i dont know how to explain it but i guess you can say it's like curry, cajun style..full of spices and fresh seafood. i think its worth every penny. simply delicious! i really want more...my boyfriend really liked his cioppino. it's pasta with really spicy seafood. i dont really like spicy so it was a bit too spicy for me but it was tasty. my boyfriend said the sauce was perfect, the spice was perfect, and the seafood was really fresh. he kept saying it was realllly good =)so me and boyfriend really enjoyed this place. i cant wait to come back soon =d must try!
yumm! i absolutely love the boiler. it really is a tasty and unique place that always has me craving for more. it might be a bit on the pricey side, but honestly, what do you expect when your bowl is loaded with seafood??? you can even sit at the bar and watch as they make your food in their special steam kettles. &nbsp;i'd rather come to this place than going to the boiling crab for some sort of cajun food any day. my absolute favorite dish is the house pan roast. ahhh delicious. the sauce is creamy, loaded with seafood(shrimp, crab, lobster, and clams), and with the right spice level (i usually get a 5-6), it's like an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. it normally comes with rice, but you can make it pasta instead, which i like a whole lot better. if you don't like shrimp or one of the things they put in the house pan roast, there are other pan roasts that come with just clam or just crab and etc. this place even has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which gives delicious appetizers for cheap! every bowl is pretty big and good for sharing. most of the time, even if i do share, i still have leftovers. if you don't want to try the pan roast, i'd say that the shrimp diablo and the cioppino are pretty delicious too. if you haven't come in and tried the food at the boiler yet, you definitely should. it'll knock your socks off!
a little gem here in chino hills! i love this place! &nbsp;this small cajun restaurant is homey at best, &nbsp;you can sit in the bar and watch the chefs cook your meal in their steam kettles. the service is phenomenal and the food is heaven in a bowl. appetizers are great, the calamari is okay- not my favorite item in their menu but the bacon wrapped shrimp is awesome and the oysters are nice and clean. their clam chowder is good, a must have when you eat here. almost everything in their menu is amazing but everyone's favorite here is the house pan roast- it's seems like every time we come here, this is what the majority eats. &nbsp;their jambalaya is amazing too! the cioppino is also good. you can pick the spice level on how hot and spicy you want them (0 being not spicy at all to 10 being burn your tongue good) they serve wine and beer- which are even better during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ($3 for wine, $2 beer). &nbsp;their desserts are good too, a must order is the creme brulee. so come check it out and you definitely won't be disappointed. this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants here in chino hills!
my partner described the house pot roast as throwing rice into a boiling crab bag. &nbsp;i like to describe it as a better version to tikka masala.let's begin by saying how much i i love indian food. &nbsp;i love their food for the abundant amount of spices to create a flavorful dish. &nbsp;for anyone who loves indian food, i can bet that their favorite dish is the tikka masala. &nbsp;if i am correct, then you will definitely love the boiler's house pot roast. &nbsp;it is another version of tikka masala... but (i'm so sorry to say this) better than tikka masala... it had a nicer blend of the spices than indian food, only because sometime indian dishes can have a bit of an overload on their number of spices. &nbsp;you can definitely taste the lobster that seeped into the rice. &nbsp;i had about 5-6 jumbo shrimps which were delicious, and the fish was a nice touch. &nbsp;i think it would've been a little better if they added sausages to it. &nbsp;my partner in crime, who also loved that dish, described it as rice put into the bag at boiling crab. &nbsp;i disagreed because i do not like boiling crab at all... but for those who love boiling crab, you can be the judge yourself.he also got the cippiono. &nbsp;we both thought that it did not go well with the pasta. &nbsp;cippiono are not supposed to go with pasta! &nbsp;however, the sauce was really good and so were the seafood. &nbsp;the sauce had a sour and sharp wine taste to it -- like a marsala (like the marsala chicken pasta at cheesecake factory). we also got the calamari, bacon wrapped shrimp, and oyster rockefeller from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;i only enjoyed the calamari, which was very thick and lightly fried. &nbsp;it wasn't chewy and was very tender to the touch. &nbsp;i do not like bacon, so i have no other comment on that starter. &nbsp;the oyster rockefeller was not as amazing as it appeared on the menu. &nbsp;i would have enjoyed the raw half oyster more. &nbsp;i would come again for lunch but not dinner because the price is a bit too much -- especially if my partner believes that it can be easily replicated by adding some rice into a bag at boiling crab. &nbsp;it would definitely save me the drive, considering how far and out of the way i had &nbsp;to make for a visit.
5 starts strictly for the fact that there's nothing else like it. &nbsp;oh, great food and service don't hurt either. &nbsp;i first heard about the boiler last year after eating at the oyster bar in vegas. &nbsp;seafood soup? &nbsp;and spicy seafood soup? &nbsp;two of my favorite things! &nbsp;i also love watching food being cooked right in front of me, so sit at the counter if you can.4 of us arrived on a saturday for an early dinner (6pm) so luckily, there was no wait. &nbsp;a hot bowl of yummy deliciousness is just what we needed after a long day of snowboarding. &nbsp;since we arrived 10 minutes prior to the end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, we also splurged and ordered the fried calamari and sausages. &nbsp;yum!having already tried the pan roast in vegas (a creamy spicy soup with rice), i went for the cioppino and loved it. &nbsp;a variety of fresh seafood over linguini in soup. &nbsp;i chose level 3 (out of 10) on the spicy radar which had just the right kick. &nbsp;(i've lost my ability to eat really spicy at my old age. &nbsp;*tear*) &nbsp;all the seafood was cooked to perfection. &nbsp;i also tasted my friend's bouillabaisse (also a 3) which was similar, but no noodles. &nbsp;i'd totally order that next time. &nbsp;i didn't try the gumbo because my friend ordered a 5 and i was afraid my tummy couldn't handle it. &nbsp;the fact that he was sweatin' bullets scared me too, but he said it was delicious. &nbsp;i was lucky enough to even taste the clam chowder, which was different than any other clam chowder i've had. &nbsp;there's a spice in it i just couldn't pinpoint. &nbsp;it was good and not too clam-y. &nbsp;eating at the counter also allows you to talk to the chef, ritter. &nbsp;he's a super nice guy and knows his food. &nbsp;he manages to handle all 12 steam pots at once to serve the entire restaurant and their take-out orders (which there were plenty of). &nbsp;they also have a bar and flat screens with the game on.it's seafood people, so it's not gonna be cheap. &nbsp;if they weren't so far away, i'd come back more often. &nbsp;(p.s., irvine peeps, they're coming to you next....)
if you've been to vegas and ate at any of the oyster bar. this place is better and closer if you're located in socal. my favorite place to go to after coming back from snowboarding from big bear.food: their calamari was good, nothing too special. maybe it's because i'm not a calamari fan, but overall it was pretty decent. the bacon wrapped shrimp tasted fried instead of baked, i'm not quite sure but it was delicious especially with the sauce they drizzle over it. my must have appetizer when i come here is a cup of their new england clam chowder. mmm the best clam chowder i've tasted so far. i tend to always come here on sunday night so it's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> time for appetizer and drinks. i recommend all the new-comers to try the house pan roast first. tastes like a creamy spicy tomato roux and it has white fish, shrimps lobsters, and clams (i believe). they serve it over rice, but i prefer pasta instead. the spice level is from 1-10 with 1 being mild. i choose 7 for everything because 5 isn't really a medium. for those returning who'd like to try something different. their gumbo isn't the best gumbo i've tasted, but probably the best gumbo you'll get around southern california go light on the spice level on this one because this one does have a lot of pepper in it to begin with. my cousin had the etoufee and he's absolutely in love with it. instead of the tomato creamy flavor it's more of a spicy seafood roux and contains shrimp, sausage, and crawfish served with rice.decor: it has a nice feel to it. it's like a modern look to it. but the best seats are the counter seats. the bathrooms are a bit small, but the restaurant itself isn't too big. i would say they could probably seat 65 people. there's a second bar for drinks, but their drink selections aren't that big.service: it's an interactive type restaurant if you sit at the counter. the chefs are funny especially chris. the waitresses are on top of their game. if it gets busy they might not check up on you as often, but if you ask any of the waitresses for anything they won't hesitate to get it for you. overall, friendly staff makes a better experience. the food does take a bit of time to cook. so if you're starving and want food to come out in a few seconds, this place isn't the right place for you.compared to oyster bar in vegas. the flavors aren't as bold (in a good way). the wait isn't ridiculous, but you might have to wait like 30 minutes if you're caught in the rushes. the staff in vegas are a bit more interactive with the customer, but they're dealing with 16 customers instead of 65.
after driving 60+ miles one way from la to play on a nice golf course in the inland empire, the boiler was a nice treat. one of my favorite go to places in las vegas is the oyster bar at the palace station hotel. that was when my friend's first introduced me to the whole steam kettle cajun cooking. some time later we got wind that such a place existed in southern california. rumors started circling amongst my buddies that a worker from the oyster bar branched off and opened up his own place in chino hills. we still don't know the real story or if the boiler has any ties to the oyster bar at all even though the concept, menu, and taste are almost identical. as you can imagine, i was ecstatic to finally have the opportunity to try out the food at the boiler.they have some weird closing <span class="highlighted">hours</span> similar to traditional japanese restaurants. check their website or call ahead or you may end up knocking on a locked door. i believe tuesdays they don't serve lunch period, mon-wed &amp; friday they are closed between the <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of 2:30-5pm, and on weekends they are opened open to close without a gap in between. they also have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, as well as beer and wine.we walked in a little after 2pm on a monday. the place was nearly empty and the waitress didn't seem too thrilled that we came in right before they were about to close. yes, i know the golden rule that when a restaurant is about to close, you should try your best to not walk in and sit down. as customers we are entitled to walk in a minute before the closing times but it's generally frowned upon. besides, i worked in a restaurant for many years back in the day so i know that sucky feeling. plus, i've been looking forward to this meal for a while. it's not that often that i find myself in this neck of the woods. however, our waitress lightened up after we chatted a little bit and she figured out that we weren't going to be those typical slow patrons. we were there to do work and gtfo. we were seated at the main bar and although the menu is extensive and everything looks enticing, we were able to pick out our food right away. we chose what we would normally get in vegas. what i appreciated seeing on the menu was that they had a &quot;lunch&quot; time portion. that meant less food but at a cheaper price. i ordered the lunch gumbo, spicy level 5 (medium) while the homie ordered the lunch house seafood pan roast, spicy level 7. the dishes were about $12-13 each. personally, both dishes were just as good as what we experienced in vegas. full of strong and intense new orleans inspired flavors, a good amount of seafood, and the scoop of rice will ensure that your belly is satisfied by the end of the meal. if you enjoy a nice tang/sour taste then i'd say go with the pan roast. reminds me of an upgraded and thicker version of tomato soup. the gumbo is on the richer side but you'll find yourself licking the bottom of the bowl. both weren't too spicy to me at all. if i wasn't curious about some of the other items on the menu for future visits, i would happily order these again.there's plenty for everyone off their menu although the majority of dishes lean on the seafood side. watching the chef make the food from the steam kettle is pretty cool and i really do believe that the food tastes better made this way versus the conventional stove and pot style. you may opt out to sit at the bar so you can witness the magic happen right before your eyes. definitely worth the stop and will be thinking about this place every time i'm in the area. a perfect meal after a long and tiring day at work or in our case, after 4.5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of hacking up a golf course.
my sister found it on yelp and she said she wanted to try it for her birthday. so we did.the reviews on yelp allowed me to have high expectations for this place.our first impression was that it was a nice looking place. the bar did not seem well stocked, but i liked what they had on tap. out of the everything we ordered, the only thing decent was the arrogant bastard we had on tap.cajun calamariit was just little slivers of meat. it wasn't the kind of calamari you would expect at this &quot;highly rated&quot; restaurant. it looked like the ones that came in the box. they were soggy, no crunch whatsoever. so far the best calamari i have had is at michael's in rowland heights.oysters on the half shellthey claim to serve blue point oysters. &nbsp;the oysters that we were served were certainly not blue point. the meat was swollen with water, it seemed like they were just injected with salt water. to someone who has never eaten oysters, they would be <span class="highlighted">happy</span> because they're getting so much meat.what they didn't know was that it was awfully bland. there was no taste. blue point oysters are sweet. &nbsp;the only good thing about their oysters, a previous yelper mentioned was that they shuck them well. &nbsp;i'll give you that. but for $16.95 for a dozen i'd rather go to the place i usually go for oysters. &nbsp;that would be the original fish company in los alamitos. appetizer combothe combo is something they have only during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it came with 2 spring rolls, &nbsp;3 bacon wrapped shrimp, and one sausage. the spring rolls were not spring rolls, they were vegetarian egg rolls. it just tasted like an undercooked filo dough with oil soaked cabbage. the bacon wrapped shrimp was served with dijon mustard was literally tasted like honeybaked ham. we went with the louisiana sausage which was overcooked and overseasoned.steamed musselsmy mother loves the steamed mussels at fish company, so when she saw this on the menu along with the description she was all for it. when the waitress brought it to her, she found hair in it. later when they took it back to the kitchen and remade it, she took a sip of the broth, which is supposed to be an exquisite reduction of the sweet juice from the mussels, white wine, sherry, shallots, and a few other spices. this was beyond the blandest soup ever. it just tasted like water with a hit of garlic and oil. my mom was so dissapointed, now we know to only trust the original fish company.house saladthe salad was romaine lettuce, red not purple onions, and avacados with a lemon vinaigrette. it was a huge helping of lettuce, but they were cut so big we had to cut the lettuce into smaller pieces. it had literally 5 cubes of avacado. the vinaigrette was not appealing, the olive oil was the good kind, but it was not balanced with the lemon and the vinegar. so for a dressing, there was only lemon juice.new england clam chowdermy sister loves clam chowder, and this one was just alright. the cream based was way to thick and there were too many potatoes it almost seemed like cubed potatoes with gravy. pan roast house this is supposed to be the most requested item on the menu. one reason i believe is what the yelpers say. when i first saw the pan roasted house, in my mind flashed a pan with olive oil and shallots and some garlic browning along with the fresh seafood all pan seared and then placed along the jasmine rice. really what it is tomato soup with seafood. if you look at the kitchen in the center and watch them cook it. they take a scoop from the cream base pot and another from the tomato base pot and stir, add some olive oil and add the precooked seafood mix. that's it. they ask you for how spicy you want it, we got a 9 and it tasted like chunky campbell's tomato condensed soup. my brother asked if they can make it hotter and the chef said oh i'll create a sauce that will take it up notch. he made the sauce, we tried it. it was not that spicy. salsa is spicier than that. if we were going to compare to the scoville units of a pepper. the 9 that he made for us would be a belle pepper. and that extra sauce with that kick would be the equivalent to a jalepeno.this place was a disappointment, and we will not be returning.
i guess this place is a great alternative to the oyster bar in vegas since its a lot closer. i have been here more than 5 times and i still am not satisfied with their food.yeah, it is good and its almost the same as the palace pan roast i had at the oyster bar but no, its not the same. i dont want to be too detailed and picky about the food but their pan roast tastes a little too sour for me. theres that right amount of sourness in the palace pan roast i had in vegas but this place is similar but its just not the same.this restaurant also takes as long as the one in vegas. why? i hate it when they are so slow and make us wait for a whole <span class="highlighted">hour</span> for our food. i was all <span class="highlighted">happy</span> when i placed my order pretty quick but i got my food exactly an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> after i placed my order. the shortest time i waited was 45 minutes.vegas is worse but why here?i did occasionally visit when my boyfriend stayed in corona for school but now that he is back here, we hardly have time to go back.decent food but you have to wait forever.
now featuring the palace station oyster bar in chino hills!!!i was turned onto the oyster bar in palace station by one of my mba friends several years ago and have introduced many of my socal friends to amazing food at the vegas 15 seat oyster bar.i'm so <span class="highlighted">happy</span> the boiler opened up in southern california. &nbsp;no more frantic drives to vegas for a pan roast craving.ritter, one of the best chefs from the oyster bar, has open this restaurant in chino hills for all of us to enjoy. &nbsp;the pan roast is only an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> drive away. &nbsp;the restaurant is only 9 weeks old however the cajun &nbsp;flavors are 14+ years in the making. &nbsp;the food is exactly the same as vegas: amazing. &nbsp;being a new restaurant, the operations are a bit bumpy. &nbsp;the chefs are on the ball. &nbsp;the food is worth the wait and you need to overlook the issues with the servers. &nbsp;the servers are a bit lost but they are trying. &nbsp;my server, some white dude, messed up more than one order with customers around me. &nbsp;food amazing: house pan roast hotness level 6 - awesomeclam chowder - awesomeseafood chipotle chowder - awesomei wanted to try the oysters however they did not have any at the time. :(definitely try it out!!!! &nbsp;for all you oyster bar lovers in socal only 1 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> drive or less depending on where you live.good luck ritter with this endeavor.
this place has gone way downhill over the years ever since chef ritter parted ways with them. &nbsp;first it's the taste and the quality of the food going down, and then the chefs there basically scoring a failing grade every time we go, and now they're shrunk their portions as well to barely enough to feed an average adult male. &nbsp;that basically marked the very last time i'll be going there.i've been very supportive for local restaurants over the years and i've been very excited to tell people about this place. &nbsp;really come to think of it, of all places they opened this one in chino hills. &nbsp;there were days where we had to wait for an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to get seated and we were still more than <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to go. &nbsp;but two incidents from my last 2 visits basically sealed the deal for us.first one was a couple months ago when i went with two of my friends. &nbsp;nothing's wrong up until we're getting our food... which almost never ever came. &nbsp;the restaurant wasn't particularly busy that day, but man... it took them over 1.5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> to get our entries. &nbsp;we're really not difficult people to please, and we don't have exceedingly high expectations. &nbsp;but 1.5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> for on a week night and what we ordered was nothing out of the ordinary? &nbsp;and the funny thing is we were not alone, as we noticed several tables of patrons all sitting there patiently waiting for their food that really almost never came. &nbsp;the flavor... well, let's just say it wasn't as good as it was.second incident was a couple weeks ago when i went with my wife for lunch. well, the chef was busy getting our food ready this time and apparently it came too quick 'cause he immediately jetted for his break and dashed out the door after sending the orders our ways. &nbsp;it's all good except our food wasn't fully cooked... the lobsters in our plates were still translucent. &nbsp;what's with the seafood restaurants in the area really why can't we just get appropriate food safe for consumption? i'm not sure how this can happen, either the chef really didn't even care, or he just dropped frozen lobsters into the steam kettles and it barely defrosted. &nbsp;either way i don't care anymore 'cause they lost my business. &nbsp;for those who might be interested, chef ritter, the original chef here has opened up his own restaurant in oc. &nbsp;i'd rather drive a little further to get appropriate food.
i've been here once - introduced by a friend to try it. i ordered the crab pan roast and it comes standard with rice unless you request for noodles as substitute. the flavor was exceptional, i had the guy who made it rank their level of spiciness from 1 mild to 10 hottest. i chose 9 and it was hot but not to the point that i loose my taste buds.the pan roast was thick and creamy full of flavor. i could not help but dip my french bread over and over this creamy sauce. overall, i think if you like cajun and seafood, it unique presentation of how the guy cooks and prepare your meal right in front (i sat at the bar) and the portion is big.my take is a for the item i had. b for its location and it's set in nowhere land. and c for its pricey nature, even for the lunch menu.the reason i gave it a 3 stars is because of the inconsistency of their business <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. i brought a friend who was visiting from l.a. over just the other day and the place was closed. not too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about it.

two words <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
yummy pizza and there is a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on sat :-)
excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices! great food the chicken nachos are delicious.. great beer selection. one of my favorite places for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
wow their mini-burgers for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are absolutely delicious..warning: you will be craving the burgersgreat service and fun people. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pizzas too!
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! lovely service and great food!
always a good time here! delicious beer and food on the late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! who doesn't love good deals?!? late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 10pm till closing!!! love this place :)
decent service...<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu has changed and there's no more pastrami sliders! they removed it from their menu.
love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. get the chicken nachos and ask for fries instead of chips!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! one of the few places in the area that have a late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or any kind of decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. love the 1/2 price appetizers (definitely way more affordable) and the chill yet nice ambiance. yard house is a chain, but a good chain.
best place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i usually go for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because their entrees are a bit expensive and not as great as they sound. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is always the best though. the only yard house that i know has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 7 days a week. i really wish they had a bit more of a beer selection like the one in san diego, but it beats all the beer selection around the area.
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials can't be beat! the food quality is excellent and the portion sizes of all appetizers are the same during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as when they are regular price. &nbsp;the service is always friendly and fast. &nbsp;my recommendations for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>:bbq chix pizzachicken nachosspinach dipspicy tuna roll
i rarely eat here when it's not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because it can be pricey, but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (every day after 10pm) has amazing deals. it's half price on certain appetizers and a few dollars off beers. examples: huge portion of chicken nachos for $5, onion ring tower for $3-4, pints of beer for $4-6. service is usually good. it is pretty crowded during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on the weekends so expect a wait (up to 1.5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> sometimes). it's also pretty loud inside.
i usually only come here for there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is delicious. great place to take a bunch of your friends and venue is at a good location. wish the restaurant was a bit larger.
pros: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> service. quality of food. atmosphere.cons: none.first off, i have only gone here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, because who doesn't like discounted beer? <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts at 3 and ends at 6 daily. anyways, i have yet to be disappointed from yh. the selections of beer on tap is astounding. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu has a variety of good eats. and allows you to order multiple items to try and taste. i have never gotten the same server twice but they are all consistent on levels of friendliness and service. good food and drinks mixed with great friends, makes for an amazing time out.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu in yard house is the bomb, i have been to several defferent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> restaurant, yard house is the best. everyone should try!!! 5 stars
this place is evil and sucks now because they got rid of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at night and on weekends... &nbsp;their menu says <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is only on mon-friday and only in the afternoon.... if they still have late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> maybe they should include it onto their menu.... used to b our occasional food/hangout spot.... the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> used b half off alot of food o well the food is still good though
they <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is worth your existence. good for groups and a fun spot for an afternoon date. everything on the vegetarian menu is delicious.
i love this place!!!! my favorite place to eat in chino! i went to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here two weeks straight! the pizza and tacos are amazing! if you have room for dessert try the smores brownie! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks aren't cheap but the atmosphere and food are well worth it.
good and service were very good. come here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and load up on appetizers. it's after 10 pm
this review is for their late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the only yardhouse that has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after 10pm everyday!. &nbsp;my go to spot if i'm bored and want to snack on some appetizers and watch some espn highlights.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ftw!!! this yard house has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> daily! yes you heard right it's daily! countless good memory happened here, good old college days, reunions, girls night out, game night, celebratory dinner, birthdays, first date and many many more!everything on the menu is good but im usually here for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cause it's so worth it!! they have so many options in terms of draft beer, bottle beer, domestic, import, fruity beer, wine, cocktails etc. let me just say there's a drink for you no matter what your preference is.they may get very packed cause full bar, decent food, tvs everywhere, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but i'm usually too busy having a blast to care about not so attentive service.pretty much everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu are good, trust me cause i've had every single item.
we love coming here for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only. &nbsp;it's our favorite place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in this area.the prices are great and the beer on tap selection is extensive.we usually just order from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> appetizer menu. &nbsp;our favorites are the hawaiian poke stack, chicken lettuce wraps, and spinach cheese dip. &nbsp;yummy and filling for a reasonable price.
definitely one of the good place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you can stuff yourself on appetizers and as much as alcohol as your body can take. the place is really comfortable and the surrounding area is safe so you won't have to worry if you are going out late.their nachos are definitely the bomb and the service are really great as they check on you quite often. i can't say much about their regular menu because i've only been there for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. parking is plenty and there are plenty of things to do in the area too.
great place to go after 10pm. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and all apps are half off. always coming here after 10pm, service is great!!
we have been to yard house several times for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and dinner. we love the the great price for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. so far we have tried onion ring, calamari, chicken lettuce wrap, the vampire taco, hawaiian poke stack, seared ahi sashimi, and we love them.the service has been great but if you go to yard house on friday and during the weekend, the wait migh be long and it may be a crowded.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, especially spicy tuna roll. spicy tuna roll - so rich in avocado cube slices and chilled for this summer appetite. love it!california roll - good but not as fascinating as the spicy tunabbq chicken pizza - great price for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>drinks - ordered a strawberry lemonade (free refills!)
my girls and i were starved, but we held out for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu that starts at 3:00 pm. we had a half priced pizza, lettuce wraps, sliders, and mac and cheese (not on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu). &nbsp;each item was tasty and well-worth the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price. &nbsp;our server was friendly, attentive, and boxed up our left overs. &nbsp;solid 4 stars on this trip!
friendly, accommodating staff. they usually let us get by a couple minutes early for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if they see we're waiting.sometimes food comes out a little slow, but rarely.
i love yard house! alcohol, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals, yummy food. :)
is there much to say about a franchise? well, they're not all the same. the good thing about this yardhouse is that they have late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day but be warned if you go on a friday or saturday, it could get pretty ratchet.it's always been a hit or miss here. food, service and drink-wise. for example, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> calamari.. it's the same portion as their non-<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but there were times the calamari came out stale and a bit cold. there were times the calamari came out in a way smaller portion too.. strange.as for their service, like i said earlier, hit or miss. for the most part, servers are professional but at times they tend to forget about your table. at my most recent experience, they forgot an order for 30min and played it off like nothing.drinks are for the most part, good here. i think there was only about 1-2 times out of 15 where my mixed drinks were made incorrectly. since they do have a full bar, they can make mostly anything you want that isn't on their menu but they do charge a premium.all in all, place is a solid 3 stars. it's great to come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...... or a forced birthday or mixer (eh...). but just keep ordering drinks, it'll make your worries go away.
yardhouse <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!!you really can't beat their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. a lot of good food for a great price.their nachos are a must and if you want to give it a little twist, replace the nachos with fries. it will blow your mind!sliders are delicious and the pizza's are solid...don't think i was ever disappointed. rarely but occasionally the food will come out a little cold...but if it wasn't for that, i would give it a solid five.
best local <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! great choices for food and beverages. service is always good. gets crowded on friday nights. my fav combo is honey blonde w/ chicken nachos. &nbsp;nachos are packed w all the good stuff! not for light eaters.
i only ever come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because it provides the best value so my review is going to focus on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - yh pretty much does the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around - for the amount of food you get coupled with the price you pay, it is definitely worth going time and time again. when i go, i always get the chicken lettuce wrap, nachos, chicken tenders, spinach and cheese dip, sliders - i'm about to name everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu - it's that good. the beer selection rotates occasionally, and they always have a wide selection - if you don't know what you like, the waiters are glad to help you and give you samples. this review applies to all their chains, not just the one in chino hills.
great service, fresh food, huuuuge portions! made it in time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and it did not disappoint! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> goodies: bbq chicken pizza, chicken nachos, ahi stack, mushroom lettuce wraps... and of course we had to get their normal dishes: caesar salad, jambalaya... basically, we got too much food, but it was all delicious!!
yard house has the most amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! you can get great food and drinks for around $5-$10!!! they give you generous portions and the drinks are delicious, especially their martini's. this is an awesome hangout place to get a big group friends together. the customer service is great. if you are not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with your food and/or drink...they will do everything to make it right. if you want a fun, cheap, and delicious <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...head over to yard house. it's also great because they have late-night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
i don't know why they made this venue different from the regular yard house. this is the only yard house &quot;bar and grill&quot; that i've heard of. the only difference is their beer selection is significantly less. i wish they had the full selection!but i'm a fan of this place because i love still love their beer selection on tap, their food, and their great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: m-f 3-6pmlate night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: sun-wed 10pm-midnightmy fav dish= spicy tuna roll (not really a cut roll. it's like a sushi cake with edamame instead of rice and avocados and cucumbers)i also love their garlic noodles!those are both part of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too!
another standard yard house location, this one has the same set up as all the others. &nbsp;service is a bit slow here but they do have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i recommend ordering the thai chicken pizza, chicken nachos, chilaquiles, bbq chicken pizza, or even something from the gardein menu if you are vegetarian. &nbsp;there are so many options and their prices can't be beat during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! parking is convenient and free at the lot at the shoppes.
it gets the job done. i only go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they have half the amount of beers that most yardhouses have. the staff is very friendly though, not sure if that's cause i go 2 sometimes 3 times a week for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
i go to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> almost every friday with my friends and coworkers! sometimes we're there twice in the same week. it is by far my favorite <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot! definitely gets very busy on friday nights so i recommended going around 930-945 and just waiting till <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at 10! service wise...these 5 stars are for servers sebastian and tyler. we get one of them as our server almost every time we go on a friday! they're always on point! even during the craziness of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. food: i've tried almost everything on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu in terms of food and my personal picks are definitely (in no particular order):1. chicken nachos2. moo shoo eggrolls3. blue crab cakes4. margherita pizza5. bearnaise slider (gardein and regular are good!)6. pastrami slider (for $1 more get it w/ truffle fries! yum!)7. fried calamari 8. chicken garlic noodles9. mushroom lettuce wraps!i know that's almost the entire <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, but i haven't been disappointed by anything i've ordered yet! other non <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items i would recommend are the deviled eggs, ripped potatoes and crispy brussels sprouts with malt vinegar aioli, the gorgonzola and mushroom burger, crab/lobster artichoke dip, lobster garlic noodles, and definitely the pepper crusted filet mignon with brandy shallot cream sauce! good lord it is delicious!!! i love this yardhouse! definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! 10pm-closing 7 days a week!
best service and fairly decent food. good place to chill, go to a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and watch some sports. must try's are truffle fries and shiitake garlic noodles. kimberlee is so sweet attentive and efficient, you're lucky if you get her! i would definitely recommend you go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, just go at least 10 minutes before the end of it. they took our names down when we arrived 15 minutes before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and seated us exactly 2 minutes after it ended.... as for drinks, try the pineapple express if you're feelin' something fruity.yummilcious factor = b+
since when does this place have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during the day?? i came here yesterday for a mid-day snack with my friend. i was super <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to find out that they had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during the day now! my friend and i shared the nachos (huge!) and the chicken lettuce wraps (our way of being healthy :p). both were around $6 each. now that i know they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> earlier in the day, i'll make sure to come more often! :)
i love this place. they always have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every night unlike most locations so i never have to worry about if they offer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or not. their food here is usually pretty expensive when it's not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but come at 10 pm and half their menu is on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> discount!! definitely recommend the chicken nachos (substitute the nachos for fries). portions are huge and delicious! great beer and alcohol selection, so plenty of options. they also have so many games and highlights playing that you'll find something you would want to watch. the one thing that gets me is that it's usually really crowded when i come and they don't take reservations. expect a minimum of 15 minute wait, but that just shows you how popular this place is.
this place is the perfect environment if u like to be around people but still like a modern atmosphere...i love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!!
this is my favorite <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in chino hills. it's the only yard house that has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every night starting at 10pm. the menu is a little different because it's a &quot;bar &amp; grill&quot;, there are some dishes that are not on a regular yard house menu. that really doesn't matter because the best place to go is during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.the service is good. the managers are always walking around making sure everything is going well. but beware, it's one of the only places in chino hills that's open past 9pm so it can get busy.the only thing i must complain about is the music. it gets too loud when the sun starts to set, that you will have a yelling contest with the people at your table.
food is delicious. can be a little pricey, i recommend to go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. :)
wanna save money?go at <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> times, everything worth eating is half off.i have never been here when it has not been <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> since the regular price is expensive.recommendations for getting during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are the bernaisse sliders or pizzas, or literally anything on the appetizer menu. almost everything there is worth it, taste and filling.if you are really hungry, chicken nachos are what you should go for.if you are one of those people who go to place, and try a kind of &quot;standard&quot; level of french fries, i recommend trying out their truffle fries, tad bit pricey for fries but worth it.alcohol: what can i say, you are at a restaurant, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> can get you a $6 goblet of sweet beer. recommend to try their lindermens(sp?).
this is my favorite yard house location. the poke salad is a must and half off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! great for everyone who love beer and good food.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every night after 10 unlike the usual sun-wed at other yard house locations!!my favs for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is their spinach dip with fresh pita chips, sliders, onion rings, garlic noodles, crab cakes, calamari, nachos, and their pizzas. prices are really fair for the amount of food you get. i'm glad that this location finally extended their menu like other yard houses. they also have pretty good lunch specials during the week.service is usually good. ambiance is chill. thurs-sat nights for <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> can get pretty packed.
i love yard house and their amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials! &nbsp;this location, though, doesn't have the best service. &nbsp;the staff were all very friendly, but i think the servers always get really overwhelmed by <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> orders that they run around like crazy and drops drinks off just anywhere on the table (even in front of a baby...). &nbsp;i wish there was a closer yard house near where i live though...
i've been here about 4 or 5 times for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i've always had a good experience.haven't had a time where the service was bad thus far. waiters are always attentive and friendly.i usually order the chicken nachos or chicken strips from their appetizers menu during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (i wouldn't pay regular price for these items but definitely worth it during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>).my last visit, i was able to get a sample of stella artois in case i didn't like it. it was pretty good and i ordered a pint of that along with the chicken nachos and chicken lettuce wraps for the girlfriend and i. $20 including tax and tip. not bad at all!honestly, i wouldn't come other than <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> just because their foods are pricey when it's regular price but it's good food and a nice, clean environment.
love this place! the ambiance is great, whether day or night. in the evening, the lights are dimmed, perfect for intimate conversation, if you prefer. the drinks are good, but can be a little pricey. you do get your monies worth though. the bartenders are friendly as well as the wait staff and hosts. the service is good and the food is tasty. i recommend trying the spicy tuna roll appetizer if you are a fan of sushi. if not, the calamari and tacos are good. great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
monday night = <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all night.idk if its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all night every monday night... but it happened to be so last night when i tagged along with a friend of mine. 8pm wasnt crowded so was seated right away and the waitress was really nice n quick when it came to service.food &amp; drinks ordered:spinach cheese dipblue crab cakeslost coast apricot wheatstop lightiono bout the stop light ($8) but the rest of the items were half off!! yay! the spinach cheese dip was reaaaaally good and id definitely get it again (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> time). blue crab cakes... make sure u eat it with a good amount of the sauce.. otherwise itll taste like something's missing. apricot wheat: fruity &amp; my kinda drink~ ^^<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> + bomb food/drinks + great service will always make my day~
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great. half off food. good quality. fun environment and everyone's <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. good beer selection and you can get a huge yard glass.
this location sucks imo. &nbsp;too small and vibe sucks. &nbsp;brea location is much better.our server at the bar didn't even mention <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;experience would have been better if they mentioned it to us.
ask for the special chicken nachos at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> times. if you like fish, get the seared ahi tuna, you'll lick the plate clean.
so i've been coming to yardhouse ever since they opened at the shoppes. i work at the cpk next door so we frequent yardhouse <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work. i absolutely love their spicy tuna roll, spinach cheese dip, and chicken nachos. my favorite martini is the gobbstopper.about 1.5 (or so) years ago they took the gobbstopper off of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu! i was pleased to find out that when requested, can still be made. i come to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every thursday night with my girlfriend who i've introduced the gobbstopper martini to, and who loves it also! tonight we made our usual thursday stop on a wednesday since this was the day our schedules permitted-- and guess what?! apparently &quot;a couple of years ago&quot; you could get the gobbstopper on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but definitely not anymore. uhm hellooooooo -- i get it every single week! i even pulled a couple of servers that have served me previously to the side to ask them &nbsp;now don't get me wrong! i wouldn't mind paying 10.50$ for the martini regularly. but the fact that they tried to make me feel stupid by saying you haven't been able to order that on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for years frustrates the hell out of me. i would give no stars for this experience if i could.
love coming here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> especially for their chicken nachos! i substitute the nachos for fries because fries are betterr than nachos in my opinion. the portion is hugee so it's really great to share amongst big parties. i also love their pizzas. just a side note, their spicy tuna roll isn't your average cut roll. it's literally just one big circle of layers of the sushi ingredients. it's a layer of rice, spicy tuna meat, avocado, seaweed, and so on. same goes for the california roll. &nbsp;however, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is really a great deal and everything on the menu is delicious! their miami ice martini is really good too and super pretty. the bartenders were also great serving our drink at the bar. however, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> does end up gettin pretty busy so service can be a bit slow.
this is the go to spot hand down! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every night after 10!? you can't go wrong there. &nbsp;not only is there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food delicious, but so is the beer! &nbsp;i frequent here often and not once have i had any issues here. &nbsp;good job yard house, keep up the excellent customer service!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. bomb. i came here with my girlfriend, and dinner during hh came out to be $14 for the both of us. all of the appetizers are half off, but i forget the alcohol specials. i guess it's pretty evident on what i am more concerned about.bottomline: the food is really good, and the pizzas are awesome. the nachos are giant too! with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, you can't beat any place else!
its all about <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.this place is great but the restaurant need to turn on some more lights sometimes (but i understand if they want the kind of atmosphere). all the servers are great, but the one that i usually get is a guy named corey is he pretty cool and is very courteous. things to try if you are new to this place:-chicken nachos (ask for them with fries instead) which are only 5 bucks during - &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>-blue crab cakes are awesome-chicken wings (firecracker glaze)
i luv this restaurant for 2 things: they r vegetarian-friendly ( they have a whole section in their menu for veg foods) and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazeballs!!! only thing is that theyr olways packd on <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> so...it took too long for booze n food to arrive
we love it here!!amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> .never had a bad meal here.good food, great beer and wine.kids love it! nice staff, good manager, music is fun.
they have the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! great food, great drinks, and great services! you should really try these during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>:+ spicy thai chicken pizza+ turkey sliders+ chicken nachos+ bbq chicken pizzafor some reasons they tend to be busier on thursdays, you might have to wait a little. but other than that, they usually seat you pretty quickly. the only downside is probably the high noise level; it gets really loud and might be kinda hard to keep a conversation going.
the one time i get something other than the appetizers, it was not that great! the surf and turf burger was not worth the price in my opinion.i think i'll stick to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and appetizers from now on.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 3-6pm, 10pm- closeselected appetizers and pizzas are 50% off. beers and cocktails are also discounted.their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> selections are very limited. there is not much to choose from, but it's great for the price!we went at 3pm and we didn't have to wait for seats, but i'm not sure if it's the same at night. their food was average, but i'm sure most people come here for their beers. our server was friendly and attentive.
really enjoyed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;got the onion tower for only $5 and the chicken lettuce wraps for $7. &nbsp;totally worth it and delicious. &nbsp;we couldn't finish it all. &nbsp;my husband got a bloody mary and was thrilled it comes with bacon and a shooter of beer. i got the miami ice martini and it was strong, but good. &nbsp;would definitely come back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;not sure everything would be as good if i was paying regular price. &nbsp;nothing like saving some coin and tasting good too.
(this review is based on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only!!! )went here on a weekday last week w/ the boyfriend n his lil sis for some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food..we were pretty starving and we each ordered 2 things from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. lol (yea we were really hungraaay) coming for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a pretty good deal b/c most of the appetizers are 50% off!!! i highly reccomend ordering the bearnaise sliders for $5.95 it's totally worth it..the sauce is super tasty and the sliders are served up w/ a big side of fries. we also ordered the spinach dip, spicy tuna roll, ahi sashimi, calamari, and fried chicken tenders. the tuna roll is so-so...it's not exactly a roll either but it's different b/c its like a stack at the bottom is cucumber sunomono salad, then a layer of edamame, a layer of the spicy tuna, and topped with a layer of fresh avocado. the calamari is pretty yummy and the fried chicken fingers are tasty too.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is mon-friday from 3-6 pm..this yardhouse location is pretty small and located at the shoppes at chino hills..so i would imagine that on a weekend for dinner this place probably gets pretty packed...so for me, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best bet! =p i did notice that they do have a number that you can call ahead to put your name in for a reservation though..if you don't come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> though..two of my favorite things to order: the ahi tuna sandwich or chicken garlic noodles(ask them to grill the chicken instead of havin it minced...sooo yummay)
when it's late at night, and you don't want the normal fast food. it's either oke poke or yard house!! love love love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here. either 3-6pm or their late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which is 10pm-close. the usuals we get for food are the chicken nachos, sliders w/ truffle fries($1 extra... but worth it!), spicy thai chicken pizza, or kung pao calamari. &amp; not all those in one sitting! for the drinks.. my fave is their rose garden &amp; black velvet. rose garden = hoegaarden white &amp; lindeman's framboise. fruity and light. :) black velvet = cider &amp; guinness. downside is that sometimes.. our food isn't cooked the way we expect it, or like it. examples: when we ask for well done truffle fries, &amp; they come out not at all crispy. brussel sprouts w/ sauce on the side, &amp; they come out drizzled in sauce. but other than that... love this yardys!
food quality and service is the same as other yard houses around but gotta dig the large variety of beer they have on tap everyday! parking is abundant cause it is in a mini-mall area and isnt too crowded at times. &nbsp;pricing for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is cheap compared to the regular prices. &nbsp;service is excellent and staff is very friendly!best thing about this yardhouse is that they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> daily and not just on the weekdays so going for a drink on the weekend with friends isnt gonna break your wallet.
never had a problem here. good service, &nbsp;good food and drinks. &nbsp;hangar 24 orange wheat on tap. chicken nachos, turkey sliders and wings are my preference. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pizza and beer are also great too.
i love yardhouse!the late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best! 1/2 priced appetizers from 10-close every night! foods great, service is great, and you can always sit at the bar and watch the game!
likes: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best and happiest time to come. &nbsp;spicy thai chicken pizza and hawiian poke stack are pretty good. &nbsp;the surprise birthday chocolate molten cake and ice cream was super awesome! :)
an updated review for this place is long overdue. i'm surprised that i gave this place a 1-star so long ago. what makes this place a winner is their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is an awesome deal. half-off most appetizers, reduced prices on pizzas and sliders, and drinks are much more affordable.i strongly recommend that you come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (mondays - fridays from 3pm-6pm). i love their firecracker chicken wings, the chicken lettuce wraps, and the spicy tuna roll. the wings have this nice savory asian kick and are deep fried to perfection. the lettuce wraps are fresh, cool, the chicken is delicious, and the 3 sauces they provide (peanut, soy sauce, and sweet &amp; spicy) are wonderful. their rendition of the spicy tuna roll is unique and delicious! it's like a cucumber and edamame base filled with spicy tuna, caked with a layer of whipped avocado, finished with radish, sprouts, some seaweed flakes, and their red shredded red cabbage. there's no rice involved!their chicken nachos, chicken strips, and calamari do not disappoint either. come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with some friends, share the food, and you will love it!
good: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices and selection, have late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> alsobad: wait time and hostess we came across before where she quote us 15min but end up 50mins waitbeer selection is good, food is not consistent enough at times, service is ok a lot of times server get side track with other bigger parties.too bad this yard house is a smaller one cause they sure could use more space to minimize the wait time.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. all yard houses don't have the same menu. this one by far has the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in the la/inland area. its monday through friday 3 - 6 pm and everyday after 10 pm. not many vegan options, but hummus and dip is always a solid choice. save your appetite for the yard!
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> any night of the week from 10pm til close. i wouldn't recommend ordering the mac 'n cheese because the portioning was way too small for what i paid.
i love this place! there are few restaurants open until 2 am and yard house is one of them. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing, from drinks to food and to appetizers; are discounted during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! my boyfriend and i are literally here about every weekend and not once do we ever feel rushed to leave. very comfy and relaxing environment.
go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> between 3-6 pm. &nbsp;drinks are always good and there's no crowd. &nbsp;i ate their turkey sandwich and pizza with my beer. &nbsp;the server was friendly and i enjoyed after lunch meal with friends at the patio.
this is a very nice yard house. they have a very comfortable patio area, plenty of booths inside. i think it's a little smaller then the one in brea, so they can fill up fast. yard house has the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you should try to go and try it out.
i definitely recommend going to any yardhouse for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. half off selected appetizers, pizzas, sliders and drinks. the first time i went i ordered the chicken nachos and ham and pineapple pizza. the nachos weren't bad, but the ham and pineapple pizza was really good. it's similar to cpk's pizzas, only it's half off! it's probably not worth going when it's not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if you're craving pizza and buffalo wings or onion rings. their buffalo wings are fantastic, too! for a dish that's half off you still get 10 wings. talk about not skimping on the wings!their service is great. the waiters here never look angry or upset and they have no problem bringing you condiments or extra napkins. the food comes out pretty quickly, too. i'm not big on drinks, but i've tried their classic cosmo (which was slightly too strong for me) and their pineapple express (which i didn't like at all because it was way too strong), plus it's not one of the half off drinks during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. boo.other than the fact that their regular menu is a bit pricey i recommend going here whether it's the 3pm - 6pm or 10pm - closing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> :)

my friends and i have a favorite beer, petrus aged red, and this is the place to get it on tap. we come here mostly for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which (for us anyways) is from 10pm-close every day. pastrami sliders and the onion ring tower are amongst the favored shareables. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here makes the food and drink prices worth it, otherwise it can be pretty pricey.i would give it a 5-star rating but the amount of service versus how busy it gets is very lacking. many times when we go and it isn't all that busy it still takes quite some time to get our drink orders taken and fulfilled.
great for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i like the different martini selections, even though they're a little on the sweet side. &nbsp;since people have already commented on just about everything on the menu... i'll rate the clam chowder, which isn't something you would normally get here. &nbsp;it is gooood! :)servers are pretty attentive here.
customer service is so good here! it was my first time &amp; boy was i <span class="highlighted">happy</span>! we went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &amp; so we got some pretty good stuff. the menu for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is pretty good.i ordered the mac n cheese that they have. bomb dot com. it has bacon, chicken, mushrooms and just a whole bunch of yummy in it. we also ordered, the truffle fries, sweet potato fries, sliders, bbq wings, and chicken nachos. yea, we're fat - we know.i loved everything about it &amp; i'm definitely coming back!
i came here with my lovely family. we came for my dads birthday. it was the first time for my dad. i have come here many times for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and for birthdays.we all ordered very different entrees. we also got drinks. my dad got me a mango mojito which was delish. my dad got wine and he definitely seemed to enjoy it. my over all experience was great. they did not make us wait for too long which was good. i would definitely go back for more. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing. they have a lot of options and the appetizers are great.
i like this particular yardhouse because it's the only one i've been to with a daily <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. yes sun-sat 10 to close. whooop!sliders...to die for, always a staple when we go grab drinks here and of course, this is where i was introduced to the infamous truffle fries...yummalmost every other yardhouse i've visited has yet to live up the truffle fries here, so it definitely does depend on which one you go to.i don't live anywhere close to here (i'm originally from riverside and go to school in irvine), but i am always willing to drive the 30 minutes just to enjoy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here.
this place has a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it's one of the few bars with 2 <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> a day, and one of them being at 10:00pm. great selection of beers and half off a few appetizers. it can get really crowded, so come early if you want to sit at the bar. try the big sky moose drool if you like dark beer.
we came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;great prices and even better food. &nbsp;the watermelon &nbsp;margarita is a must it's &nbsp;amazing :) try to get lisa she was a great and attentive server. &nbsp;i would come back here just because of the service!
great food, friendly staff, and nice atmosphere. love the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day after 10pm. highly recommended
good beer, good friends, good times! notice i didn't mention good food? cuz i've pretty much never eaten here in the 673736293 times i've been here. stick to drinking i say. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends at 6 now (lame!) but late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is always appreciated (10-close) since not much is open late in the area...well except for the dennys across the street (its open 24 hrs btw) haha eat there instead!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only:yard house is still one of my favorite chain spots for good ol' <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it's always spacious and with plenty of tvs for all games. they have a vast array of solid appetizers available like spinach cheese dip, sliders, pizza, wings, lettuce wraps and more. the list is so extensive! always have a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> belly after.service is always friendly and parking at this location is usually pretty easy unless you go during peak <span class="highlighted">hours</span>.see you yh when i need to unwind with some friends!
i was here for a friend's birthday. it was during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so they had half off on all appetizers. i was seated at the bar area that was surround by multiple hd tvs, which was quite entertaining and fun. i ordered the bbq chicken pizza, chicken nachos, buffalo strips, and house amber which most definitely satisfied my drunk munchies. the ambiance was low lit and very romantically social. the service was prompt and responsive at the bar. drinks were refilled 2/3 in. overall, it was a good place, good environment, and good times.i would recommend coming here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to set a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> mood :)
gotta love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i just come now and get everything ordered before six. &nbsp;whats nice is that even at 5:30pm, there isn't a wait...i just keep going with their calamari, sliders, and pizzas. i didn't like their poke stack but that's just me. &nbsp;servers always seem to recommend it.
me and some girlfriends were in there last friday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and our bartender scott was awesome and very attentive. he made us a great holiday drinks that had us asking for more. there were even some generous patrons who were in the spirit of giving which made the evening better :) this is one of our local hang out spots where the girls and i meet up and have a good time. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best time to go, that night our bar tab was about $25 for the two of us and we were there for about 5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. spicy tuna roll and seared ahi salad are some of my favorites.
my husband and i came here late sunday night because it was the only place open still serving food (that wasn't fast food). the place is super loud, so dont go here if you want to actually hear the person across from you. the menu prices are a bit expensive. but luckily we came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. jackpot! appetizers (full size)and pizzas are 1/2 off and sliders are $6.50. we ordered the calamari and pastrami sliders. they were both excellent. &nbsp;i would definitely come back during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.update: we came again and ordered the margherita pizza to go (fyi, no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing on to go orders). i loved it!
a really great spot for hang outs with friends and having drinks. i usually go here during the weekends, gets busy at nights but i enjoy the environment. they have a large variety of alcohol drinks. music is loud there, but it's all apart of yard house. i also have to conclude their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. there are many selections to choose from. but overall, if you like to have a good time and like to eat and drink during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, this is one of my favorite spots for that. it does get busy most of the time and sometimes waiters are slow, but that's just a few down fall but i still give them five star.
this is as good as it gets in sh-tty chino/chino hills. &nbsp;sadly. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is packed because there is nowhere else to go in this town if you aren't a serial killer.
got my food order down by johnny vegara and already knew what kind of beer i like. stone ipa fyi. the dude analyzed my like a hawk. i've never see that type of service before. he even knew what type of appetizer i wanted which was the sliders. great place to go to with friends especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. probably the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around to have a good time.
for as big as this restaurant is service here is sucky. we arrived here at 930/945 we have had 4 different waiters. i do give then credit for there drink prices during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. we ordered there fried calamari extremely rubbery and kind of cold.
alcohol - full bar, great selection of beers on tap. really impressed by all the beer that they have on tap, they also have good house brews.food - i don't think i've had something here that was &quot;bad&quot;. all the food is very consistent every time i've come here. nothing is really spectacular but if you come for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, both regular and late night, they are pretty good deals.i usually only come here for the late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 10pm to close. pretty good deal, couple dollars off brews and half price appetizers. i like the spicy tuna rolls, the pizzas are not bad and the parmesan fries are good! usually sit at the bar and the service is always nice, even when sitting at a booth the service is good too.overall, can't complain about this place. really good and consistent with beer!
tilted-kilt-chino
really good time today. heather and monique were great bartenders. only complaint is the lack of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> value on the food side. enough choices in the area that the food prices should be more inviting for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. beer and &quot;scenery&quot; is great!
went back again. they have improved the speed and quality of service. i love the hoppy/<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. the ambience is awesome and celtic sported bar to the next level.
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals on appetizers! &nbsp;the flatbread pizza and chicken quesadillas are amazing and the homemade potato chips are great! &nbsp;girls are classy and sweet.
went there for super bowl! the waitresses are really hot! no minimum charge for the great game which is good. just a bit annoying when they trying to do the raffle during the super bowl ads. they mute the ads and do raffle in house. we cannot enjoy the super bowl ads. the food and drinks are good. price is fare. during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> even better. we have lots of ppl, so ordered all of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. the whisky beef is the best.
good sports bar with tons of tv's. we were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the beer selection and good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. the service was relatively good and everyone was very friendly. the wings i ordered were very tiny and not filling at all. *good beer selection*poor food options*great for sports events*average to good servicewe will be back again for football sunday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. unfortunately we will have unch or dinner before we come for drinks.
best service from jamid at the bar! must sit at the bar and have some great ice cold beverages and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!! great entertainment!
went to have drinks with the wife. the experience was great. service was awesome. always had a cold beer in front of me. never a empty glass. the garlic fries are off the hook good! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was fun. new things to try off that menu. if you want a fun environment go here!!!
great service at the bar from bartender jamid! nice place to hang out for a couple beers. good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the irish dip was tasty. i'm sure i'll be back again
i came to the tilted kilt because i had a coupon for free irish nachos, and good thing they were free cause if i had payed for those things i'd be pissed- they were greasy and flavorless. my black and blue burger was dry and unsatisfying. my mom really enjoyed her blackened chicken flat bread however. i give them 3 stars because the ambiance is relaxed and causal, a good place to grab a beer (they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>) and our waitress sasha was sweet and attentive. i'll probably go back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and steer clear of the irish nachos this time.
this place was super!! the food was delish, the beer was (non-alcoholic) excellent, and taylor was the best server of all time. she made us promise to return for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. and dinner. and breakfast... ;)
the girls are super pretty! but the service was horrible! food was good. we came <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>..etc etc. but the server lied and said it was 7 dollars but the tab turned out to be way more. shes stupid.
oooh my goooood fix your sound system. tvs cut out every 5 seconds.why does it take me 20 min sitting at the bar to get another round at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> when it's hardly busy?seriously tho. just turn off your sound system until it's fixed. this is horrible.
jenn is the cutest and has the best customer service in this place. i will definitely come back at least twice a week just because of her awesome service. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is worth coming for and the food is great. hooters is a thing of the past. long live tilted kilt.
first of all shout out to our awesome waitress camille. great customer service, give this girl a raise. i'm a big fan of the tilted kilt. reasonable priced beer and the best boneless wings anywhere. &nbsp;i suggest the tilted sauce on those boneless wings. i've had other stuff here too and it's was all very good.bring the entire family, no problem here for babies or grandmas, its super friendly environment. great <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, before 7pm and after 9pm. like this. just learned they serve breakfast. i must investigate and update my review.
this is my second time going to tilted kilt in chino hills. my first time was decent. this experience today was awful , not only was it awful but it had a lot of attitude. the minute we sat down we decided to order our( free text messaging garlic fries).the minute we sat down our server seems very uninterested in serving us food but very pushy to serve alcohol. she told us that the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu was only with the drinks listed on the table. trying to skip around the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu listed or (hoppy <span class="highlighted">hour</span>) as they call it. stating the prices was really no different then the regular menu. and that the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> went back to the drinks saying that was the only thing that was the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. i had to explain to her that we had already looked at the menu and we're going to order at 3 o'clock but first order and enjoy our free garlic french fries and when <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts we will order from the menu. (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was 25 mins away and we were there to watch the game)we ordered our food at three and watch half the world cup soccer game only because service was not so good. our food came out but not all of it , she then said oh and got the remaining order for us no big deal ... i understand its busy. we eat then asked for a bill since we are ready to &nbsp;go. &nbsp;our server charged us for the free french fries and i mentioned it shown on the bill. she then told me that i didn't show her the text message which i had showed her and clearly remember showing her to order our free french fries . she then said oh ok i'll take it off the bill but only after i showed her the text. service is crappy i don't even drink alcohol the food felt like left overs with sauces and put fusion style with major confusion to the dishes and it sauces. i had decided to mention it to management and she rushed to find me and asked me where my bill was since i took the check book and asked if i was going to be talking to a manager. i kindly told her that i had the bill and yes that i was going to just talk to the manager about a few things. she then rush to ask me if i had found the manager yet or if i had already asked to talk to one as if she was interested in helping me. &nbsp;i had then explain to management her service and also &nbsp;typically when people order on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu they tip more at times at least i typically do. &nbsp;i also told management that i can understand the pressures of working with an environment .i told management that they might want to tell the server that some people do tip: larger when ordering at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menus at times also that i wasn't trying to get her fired from her job. very inexperienced server but the management was great. he &nbsp;took care of our check and gave us 2 $5 gift cards on top of it. i left feeling satisfied, yet felt &nbsp;that the service wasn't worth compromising to make another complaint. i don't know if i'll come back.
only been there twice. they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-6, and from 10-close (11pm?). i'm not sure if that stands for every day or just weekdays. for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they feature $1off beers and $3 well drinks. both times i came here were after 10, which is when they close down their kitchen, so i have never had any of the food. they do last call 20 minutes before 11pm, and both times they had to wait for us to finish our drinks past closing time. we had one beer each (pretty big selection of beers both on tap and bottled) and two well drinks (rum and coke, cranvodka, etc..) and spent only like $30 or so which is really a great deal for 4 people. the first time it was a monday night and the bartender was a tall girl with black hair who took a while to take our orders but she was very friendly and had a kind smile. the second night ( tuesday, the following week) it was a shorter girl with black hair and tattoos who seemed to be closing up early. although she wasn't rude, she wasnt friendly and was trying to rush us and we felt as if she was trying to get us to leave. we had a better time the first day than we did the second. i haven't gone back since, but i could consider it, since their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices were appealing. they have a lot of tv's, so if there was a game on, you have many places where you can turn to watch. the bar was maintained neat, and i particularly remember noticing how clean their restroom was. not bad for the price, but i feel like i haven't really explored the full tilted kilt experience. maybe next time i'll come in during their mid day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so i can try the food.
i was there for the big title fight and clippers game at the same time. despite the huge crowd and tight seating my service was excellent and special commendations to the bar tender bryce who always made sure i was taken care of . the atmosphere is cheery and the food delicious. you cant go wrong with the flat iron steak salad . its marvelous. &nbsp;and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> grubs food is downright tasty . the shepherds pie a winner ! easy parrking, close to the 71 freeway and a great staff !
so my fianc&eacute; being scottish we decided to finally try the tilted kilt. we were ready for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and some football. we were seated right away, then waited.....and waited......and waited. basically we were there 20 minutes, and never once got a be right with you, here's some water while you wait, nothing. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended at 7pm. and we were there at 5. but given the fact we never got helped <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> would have ended by the time we got anything. its a shame. there menu looked good. we got up to leave and thats when we were followed out with, &quot;why are you leaving?&quot; really??? we have been sitting for 20 minutes, only to see the busboy checking his hair out in the mirror. the gave us money to come back and eat again. but do i really want to go through that again?? we went to dillons and got served right sway, sticking to dillons, yes its further from our house but its worth the drive to get great service. maybe one day ill venture back, but not any time soon.
good food, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 7 pm and good service. our server was jazmin and she did a good job. still learning the menu, but, that's ok bc they haven't been open long.  &nbsp;give this place a try. the poor reviews, in my opinion, aren't fair bc they haven't been open very long. like all restaurants, they are working out the kinks.
every year my mom and aunt take us to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to apple bee's this year we decided to try a new place. wow very impressed food was very good. super friendly staff even &nbsp;girls that were not our waitress came by and checked on us. one waitress bree was awesome she came vy we were bot her table did not know her and she got to know us. locef it here will be back for sure.

this place is like hooters but really nothing like it. this place is a irish pub restaurant. this place is the mecca of all sports bars because it's also a family restaurant. excellent selection of liquor and beer. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is where it's at at this place. all day everyday from 3pm-7pm &amp; 9pm-close. $2 appetizers, can't go wrong with that. ask for beer cheese, it's amazing. having a burger and buffalo wings are a must here, it is a pub after all so try bar/pub food. they also can pair a beer with your burger, that's pretty awesome. they show pay-per view events with a $5 cover fee. services is excellent. women dressed in kilts serving you. it's more of a family oriented vibe than hooters. hooters is a vein of my existence. tilked kilt is the new hooters with everything better especially the food, 100% better. very clean. extremely recommended.
went to the tilted kilt for the first time today. it was their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;their domestic beers, some on tap, and a couple ciders are included (the angry orchard is really good).the ambiance is a lot of fun. tons of tvs if you want to watch the game. the wait staff is very friendly, and will come and sit with you at the table, and chit chat along the way. &nbsp;(&agrave; la hooters). natalie waited on us tonight and she was a lot of fun. &nbsp;the rest of the wait staff was always ready and willing to help as well. the food was good. &nbsp;good portions. prices are good. &nbsp;my wife got the blue cheese burger, and she thought it was a bit on the salty side. &nbsp;overall though the food isn't bad at all, but it also isn't anything out of the ordinary. &nbsp;i'm glad they opened up a new hang out place near. &nbsp;we'll likely add it to our rotation.
the food we had was okay at best. &nbsp;we stopped in for &quot;hoppy <span class="highlighted">hour</span>&quot; on our way out to the dodger game. &nbsp;we texted in for a code that got us free garlic fries and we ordered the rest off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and split it up amongst us. &nbsp;the waitress was nice, but at the end she did not take the garlic fries off the bill (sidenote: i have been to this location before with somebody who has texted in for the free fries and they did not remove it from the bill that time either... i was told by our waitress last time that management tells them not to inform guests of hidden costs like for sauces, i will bet that management tells them not to remove the fries until they are told to fix the bill). &nbsp;overall, i am just so completely unimpressed with this location. &nbsp;we had close to every item on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, and all the food tasted meh. i don't understand what is wrong with this location, because i have never had any problems and the food has always tasted fine at the location in orange.
we waited 15 minutes before we got up and asked if we can get a waitress. &nbsp;there were girls standing around and sitting at tables but nobody wanted to help us. &nbsp;the drinks were $8 and the beers were $7 and it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ($4 for bud ). the garlic fries were greasy and the food wasn't good and they charged us extra for ranch. &nbsp;a restaurant shouldn't charge for condiments - no other restaurant chargefor ranch except fast food. &nbsp;very expensive,bad service and bad food. &nbsp;i may &nbsp;try it &nbsp;again for sunday football because of all the tv's.
first of all, heather is the best waitress. i came in with my coworkers after work on friday and she greeted every single person with a genuine smile. she then told us some awesome jokes and brighten up my first experience here. we also hula hooped which was really fun. the fries here are awesome! i couldn't stop eating my coworkers. the chips with nacho cheese and tabasco was tasty too. we came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so all draft beers were 3 dollars. this place gets compared to hooters a lot, but tilted kilt is definitely better. there are 3 large tvs so you can watch all the different sports you want to. the decor is very irish and bathrooms are pretty clean. i give this place 5 stars because their service is awesome and the waitresses are really fun. food is decent for a place like this. heather is the best!
great experience. we were in town to photograph a wedding and needed to hit up a best buy. as we pulled in i saw the restaurant and have heard good things about it. for a friday evening it was busy but we were seated right away!our waitress michelle was frigging great. not only was she beautiful, she was super friendly and took care of us! i orderd some aps since it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the corned beef and cabbage spring roll. sounded better than it was but still, ok. also orderd the irish poutine... yummy!!! fries, cheese, bacon, and this sweat yummy gravey... perfection.!my boyfriend orderd the shepherds pie for his main course and i got the irish stew. both, perfect! it felt and tasted like good home cooking! male sure you leave room for dessert! we got the white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie (hot right out of the oven) with &nbsp;ice cream on top! yummy!all in all. good food, great service, beautiful women,..(and men too... one guy walked by with a kilt on a almost fell out of my chair.. hubba hubba!!!!)
last night, i came here to meet up with a friend and based on my experience, i'll skip a return visit or even suggesting it to friends.  we came in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the greeting i received from the hostess should have been my warning for what was to come from the rest of this experience. &nbsp;i was told i could sit anywhere, but they didn't even offer to walk me over to the bar. i sat down in a place that i thought was the bar, only to realize that it wasn't. &nbsp;but the thing that really bothered me, was that we sat there for almost 5 minutes and nobody came to check on and/or welcome us. &nbsp;thinking we could get some better service or even acknowledged, we moved to a couple seats at the actual bar top. but even that did not work. &nbsp;we had to flag down the female bartender just to be acknowledged. (side note: an employee working behind the bar stood right in front of us 3 times and said nothing to us.) i asked a waitress for a knife and she never came back. &nbsp;i asked someone else and was told that they tend to run out of knives, so they make utensil set with just forks and quite a few people may get one with a knife missing. and that i should check my friend's silverware set for my knife. ummm, no...how about just bringing a new one out.seems like the staff only favor the male patrons. might as well, put a sign at the door saying, &quot;gentlemen only establishment&quot;. i will gladly go spend my money somewhere else, where they give the same attention to all of their patrons.food wasn't memorable and the beer was depressing.
i love that we finally have a tilted kilt in chino. i went to the one in santa clarita first after my boyfriend told me about it. the one in chino has tons of tv's and projector screens so that no matter where you are sitting you can see the game or all the games! the bar and the community table also look like a really fun places to sit and hang out with everyone. the only thing they don't have that the one in sc did was a pool table, which would make this location even more awesome. the food was also pretty good, it's a lot of bar food, and even though they don't have too many vegetarian options. my favorite food is actually the garlic truffle fries, they are so good! they have a good beer and drink selection as well, and now finally a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! service is also really great, the girls stop by often to ask if you need anything and always have a smile. i recommend this place to watch a game and chill with friends.
so ive been here for an 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> and ive had to ask twice to get served the same drink by two different bartenders. making excuse for your co worker is unacceptable this is your tip man!! tip: manage your bar better and stop making excuses for your co workers dam it!!!! im a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> drinker and will tip generously if you do your job correctly #imdone
stopped in for &quot;hoppy <span class="highlighted">hour</span>&quot; with my friend and was very disappointed. &nbsp;i'll start with the food and then get into the service.we ordered off the &quot;hoppy <span class="highlighted">hour</span>&quot; menu. &nbsp;we got the celtic poutine, whiskey beef and one of each of the offered sliders (one grilled meatloaf and one pulled pork &amp; bbq).their own menu describes the celtic poutine plate as an &quot;unholy mess&quot; and well, you can't sue them for false advertisement. this plate is just that, an unholy mess. &nbsp;nothing in this plate unifies it. instead of using a cheese that melts all over those fries they use white cheddar cheese curd (which just sits as clumps of cheese atop the dish). &nbsp;the sam adams boston lager demi glace is sweet (and to me, didn't work with the dish) and it pools oddly at the bottom of the dish, leaving your last few fries a soggy mess. &nbsp;this is the one time i wasn't <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to see bacon on a dish as the fries were already over salted (i mean, i get it, you're a bar, and salty dishes make people thirsty, so they purchase more drinks but please, too much salt might kill a man, you know?).the waitress warned me the sliders were small, and boy were they! not only were they small, they were unimaginative. &nbsp;simply meat between two mini hamburger buns. &nbsp;a little coleslaw added to the bbq pork slider and/or a slice of cheese added to the meatloaf slider would have given them some character. &nbsp;both sliders were equally and sadly, dry. &nbsp;again, i get it, dry makes me thirsty, but if you're going to make me thirsty, check on me every now and then and see if i'm parched, won't you?this brings me to the service portion of the review. &nbsp;if you're going to brag about all the beers you have on tap, please make sure you know what you actually have on tap. &nbsp;we were told they had a goose island 312 wheat on tap and then, without even asking if it was ok to swap it out, we were given some other goose island beer. &nbsp;all we got was a &quot;here you go, turns out we didn't have 312 anymore so i got you this other goose island beer.&quot; excuse me? it would have been nice for us to choose something else.if i really want to gripe (and i will), i hate being served beer out of plastic cups. &nbsp;this is a bar and grill. &nbsp;the furniture and decor is nice, but you can't serve me a beer out of a clean glass? i don't expect a goblet, snifter, tulip or weizen glass....but at the very least, a regular old, run of the mill shaker pint will do. &nbsp;i want the thickness of the glass to act as a buffer zone between my heated hand and that cold inebriating beverage (plastic just won't do).after our beers were served and our orders placed, we received an obligatory, &quot;how's everything?&quot; from our waitress. &nbsp;we had to ask for a set of silverware and napkins (i hate having to ask for napkins!!!!!)we did witness a group of women walk in and walk directly up to our waitress and start chatting away so i assume we got neglected because she was preoccupied. lastly, my chair was broken...well, the seat wasn't affixed to the rest of the chair. i wish we would have stayed across the street at applebee's all night instead of deciding to be adventurous and trying something new.

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4pm-7pm! sliders (4 small burgers) for around $4-5, fries, wings, chips, drinks for cheap!our server was great. she made sure we had everything we needed and always came back to ask if we were doing alright. oh get the hazelnut beer! it's yummmmy
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is pretty good, free chips and salsa. my friends and i only go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, the burgers are good- nothing spectacular, its the bacon cheddar fries and pints of stone ipa that keep me coming back.
my wife hates this place because they don't give you fries to go along with your burger order. &nbsp;i wouldn't care for it either except that their burgers and their appetizers are good. &nbsp;what makes it even better is that during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, all appetizers are 1/2 off. &nbsp;heck, we just sit at the bar, watch the lakers play and stuff ourselves. &nbsp;i couldn't think of any other way to enjoy dinner. hah

came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. had a great time. nice ambience. each kid got sketch a pad to play with. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> requires seating in patio or bar only. server, michelle (with glasses), was especially tentative to our needs. made our dining experience all the more better.
eh, the food here is very greasy and quality isn't good. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is filled with non appetizing filler foods. their grilled chicken bay sandwich isn't that great here. the food here is just overly friend, oily and salty. the decor here is very nice! loved the decorations.
good service. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> exists on weekends. we walked in on a saturday night during dinner <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and were able to self seat at the bar and be served right away. prices not too bad. ribeye ordered rare is truly rare, but gristly.
pleasant ambiance, great food, comparable to wood ranch in the shoppes. going you for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> i write defiantly recommend the chicken pot pie soup
come see russell! amazing service and love his enthusiasm. check out their phenomenal <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu everyday from 11-6 and 9-close! everything is delicious. especially the margarita. haha! love this place!
yum! railroad camp shrimp is the best! great pasta and the potato soup was delish! service was great and friendly. we'll be back. heck, we may become regulars. good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too!
had the filet &amp; lobster tail and it was great, top shelf margaritas and bloody mary was on point, after a few more beverages my dd drive us home. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 9th till close!
customer service is beyond great!! our server jojo was so kind and helpful. she went through the menu with us and was very attentive. the salads are delicious and the food is good too.cheesecake is yummy!<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials are so so great. the atmosphere is good too.
i've been here a few times. if you plan on coming here i recommended ordering off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. they have a lot of good appetizers and these decent sized burgers for 5 bucks with a side. unfortunately i can't say the same good things about the actual entr&eacute;es. the steak here is mediocre at best. i feel like i can grill a better one myself. the chicken wasnt bad, but wasn't anything to write home about either. the ribs seemed like they may have been purchased at a grocery store down the street. i can honestly say that the mashed potatoes were the best part of my meal. i'd come again, but only if its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i would like to note that the service was great!
came here for dinner tonight and absolutely loved it. russell was our waiter and the bartender (noelle??) were amazing. russell walked us through the whole menu and even offered us <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. my michaelada was delicious. this place is very affordable, but you can't beat the service. i could even taste the wood fire in my meal. because it was our first time there, he let us try a bite of cheesecake. it was really creamy and definitely hit the spot. will be coming back for more <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> and dinners because of amazing customer service. thank you tahoe joes for being a place where customer service still exists, rare to find nowadays but very much appreciated.
my wife and i stopped by the other day for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sat at the bar. first time here.first, the atmosphere was pretty cool. the decor made you feel &quot;woodsy&quot; with a hanging canoe and wooden furniture. really liked it. we sat at the bar and ordered 2 drinks and decided to have death by appetizers. we ordered one of each appetizer that ranged between $2.99 to $3.99 which is what <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> should be. domestic beers were a few bucks and i think an import beer, (tall) was $6.50 give or take a few cents. we got our drinks and waited for our food. out it came and the sliders were the best, awesome. loaded fries were good but since we don't eat cheese, it was a waste to order. not their fault. wings were solid and my wife really enjoyed the camp shrimp (or whatever the shrimp plate was called.)we ordered another round and finished the appetizers. the bill came to $45.00. when we are in chino hills, this will be our <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> place for sure.everything was perfect except one thing... the bar selection for liquor is a little limited. would have liked some different infused vodkas like cucumber and such, but that's just us wanting the world.
this restaurant was recommended by some friends. my family and i enjoyed every aspect of the restaurant from the food, decor, and service. our server (markay) was awesome. great salad, soups, apps, main courses, kids menu, and cheesecake. not to mention the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food menu, absolutely incredible! try them out, you will enjoy it.
returned for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> several months later. decor and design of restaurant is all it has going for it. it's basically sizzler quality food. if you like sizzler, rolling 7-11 food or crapplebees then this place will slide right in safely at 3rd base for you. if you enjoy good quality well thought out unique food this ain't it <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review. 4-6pm had steak sliders, the cheeseburger. &nbsp;5pm tuesday the restaurant was 15% capacity and yet the service was still slow. bartender conversation was awkward and all about him, odd? lol. &nbsp;the food? meh.... low quality fatty steak, horrible soggy fries and a mediocre cheese burger. &nbsp;the decor is very nice and open, refreshing, gorgeous patio. but you can tell the staff is not experienced or trained well i.e. i asked for steak sauce and i kid you not she asked me &quot;a1, cholula, sriracha or worcestershire&quot;. lmao. &nbsp;done
i finally found my favorite thing on their menu: joe's steak sliders with a side of their grilled green beans. sad thing is, they only serve the sliders during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and they are not on their regular menu, thus, the 3 stars. &nbsp;if tahoe joe's made that change to their menu, we'd be visiting more. so, come'on tahoe joe's make this girl <span class="highlighted">happy</span>!
my first time here today. staff was very friendly and the food was yummy. they offer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 2pm so got some apps: spinach artichoke dip, string onions, and the big shrimp. all very yummy and filling. for lunch i had the chicken pot pie soup which was very delicious along with the peppercorn sirloun with mashed potatoes and veggies. my meat was a little dry, but i'm used to eating more rare meats so that could be why. also tried their mudslide which was super good? would love to try this place again in the future :)
i love tahoe joe's! everything is amazing: steaks, chicken, juicy and delicious, it's took over almond wood. they have a killer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with cheap wings, tacos, sliders, jackpot nachos, camp fire shrimp are amazing. great salads friendly and fun bartenders, as well as amazing drinks, a great beer selection, all accompanied by unbelievably beautiful building!!! p.s the tableside baked potato topping service it's the best!
good food. i love the buffalo wings. i like how they have a toy for the kid to play with. and the fact that it's not an electronic device. however we got a server tell us no <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> on sundays. then manager said there is. then server said the manager fixed it for us. ok what? made it seemed like we forced it? what the hell. i'm sorry but the server just brought that star doown.
today i went and tried this because i was in the mood to try something new. it was so fancy perfect place to take someone on a date! the food is mouthwatering best steakhouse by far ive ever been too. i ordered bbq. chicken that was so tender and juicy,cane with the best mashed potatoes and green beans, and my boyfriend ordered ribs that literally fell off the bone! the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity you receive. i am definitely going back! :)yay for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>
only went once, but first impressions do mean something. i made it clear it was our first time there and we needed time but the server just kept hovering . (and not in a helpful way.) i got the burger and it was really good, but my wife ordered the steak and it was dry. the place wasn't crowded either so i thought the server should have been more attentive. at first she was hovering but then she disappeared and she never came back to refill my $4 tea. ripoff! my wife wants to give the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> a try, but i'm on the fence.
my first visit was awful. &nbsp;we were never seated after being quoted 30 min and waiting 2 1/2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. &nbsp;my second visit was better, but while the service was great, the food was nothing special. &nbsp;the cheesecake was worth the visit! &nbsp;third visit was better. &nbsp;cool <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals and the manager went out of his way to make a small problem all better. &nbsp;bought a whole cheesecake in between visits for a bday party and it was a huge hit! &nbsp;visited again on sunday night. &nbsp;sat in the bar. &nbsp;the service was amazing! &nbsp;the food was great. &nbsp;the pumpkin pie martini was so good! &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy</span> to be able to improve my first review.
came here on a friday night with my family. took a while to get us seated because we were a party of 9. i love the decor which really reminds you of being in a cabin in tahoe. we had 4 kids with us which is why we chose this place because they had a kids menu. our server was extremely helpful and nice. i had bacon wrapped shrimp with pilaf and it was excellent. it took a while for the food to come out which was not understandable because by the time we came the dinner crowd had already died down. overall, i would come here again for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or lunch
we tried this place 2 weeks ago and had to go back yesterday. it will become one of our &quot;go to&quot; places for great food! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu runs all day with drink deals and appetizer deals. but, the regular menu is awesome! aged beef (28 days minimum), the shrimp is divine, &nbsp;the baked potato is like a football and they bring out all the fixins to do right at your table! frank, the bartender during the day, is a gracious host. very knowledgeable about the menu and all around great guy!bon appetit!bob
first time coming here with my fianc&eacute; and service was excellent. we came in during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and ordered the house appetizer, railroad camp shrimp and the buffalo wings. for being the house appetizer it was only average nothing too special. i ordered a margarita that i didn't finish because it was super sweet. when my shrimp scampi came out the white wine sauce was to die for. it melted in my mouth. my fianc&eacute; order came, petite gorgonzola fillet, and oh my goodness, order this! not to mention the mashed potatoes were extremely flavorful. overall, great experience, beautiful ambience and a great date night! recommend this restaurant to anyone. (shout out to chase for being an excellent waiter. very helpful and descriptive with the menu.)oh and the homemade cheesecake was the best cheesecake my fianc&eacute; and i have ever had!
came here on a saturday night and decided to sit in the bar area to take advantage of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. we were seating promptly and then proceeded to wait for our server. unfortunately this was the theme of our evening.....waiting for our server.the sad thing was is that she spent the entire evening outside on the patio area at another table that was directly beside ours, only separated by the glass window. it is very frustrating to see our server through the glass laughing it up and having a great time at our expense.i'm sure the restaurant on the gentlemen's shirt she was chatting with all evening &quot;joey's bbq&quot; doesn't understand the meaning of customer service either since he felt it was okay to chat with the server instead of letting her do her job. i won't be going to that establishment now that i witnessed this.i was really hoping this new restaurant was going to be different than all of the other concepts that have tried out this location. it seems as though the location is cursed and nothing can succeed here.just take a look at all of the other reviews. they all point to poor service which means the owner needs to remedy this or they will continue to loose business.the food itself was actually good. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials were great (sliders, nachos) but when the service is this bad, the whole dining experience suffers.
the peppercorn sirloin was pre-cut and the sauce was peppercorn not the steak. the steak was a little cold due to it being pre-cut &amp; served on a cold plate. the mountain mashed potatoes were okay and the green beans were good. they just went for looks when serving vs function. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only consists of $4 22oz &nbsp;domestic beer &amp; $1 off others but good prices on food; they state they would like everyone ordering food to order a drink. nice atmosphere inside though.
been there 2 times already good experience both times a little pricey but standard among steakhouses of that caliber 15.99 for a steak salad. they have late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 9 til close. you won't be disappointed with the quality of meat. service a touch slow at the moment but they are busy! so it's understandable. i'm going back much more to try.
we have been here for dinner several times now and the food is better than we anticipated. &nbsp;they promote the railroad camp shrimp appetizer, but it's so crispy/hard that i don't really enjoy that one. &nbsp;what i do like is their appetizer salads, prime rib, side baked potato and a mai tai (one of the tallest glasses and sweetest i've tasted). &nbsp;their cheesecake is absolutely fantastic - very rich and new york style. &nbsp;i'm not even a huge fan of cheesecake, but this one is insanely good. &nbsp;all of the friends and family i've taken here really like it - but they love that cheesecake! &nbsp;the staff is super friendly and attentive also.the bar area is nice if you just plan to come in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and they also have a nice covered outdoor patio too.
came here for lunch based on a recommendation of a business associate that had hit the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> a couple times.first off, 70 minutes in-out for lunch is too long.not sure if there is a staffing issue or what but i saw 5 people total when we arrived and 8 total while we were there. long wait for each interaction with the waitress.(who seemed nice, hence the 22% tip )the food was hit &amp; miss @ best. grilled chicken that was dry on overly hard bread, soggy under cooked fries. steak sandwich that was average and the bright spot of the visit, a blue cheese burger, also will crummy fries &nbsp;(tip to mgr., when you see three big guys at a table, and you stop to ask how it was, notice that no-one has come close to cleaning their plate)i wanted to like this place and the d&eacute;cor is very nice but, chino just simply has too many choices for a good lunch to settle (and pay) for this.i may visit the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &amp; try the prime rib slider i've heard about but then i wont have to get back to work inside a <span class="highlighted">hour</span>.
was there on a tues evening, love the fact that they have two <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>; 4-6pm and 9-close. i tried most martinis on their menu and they were delicious. the decor is amazing! love that you can smell all the real wood as you walk in the restaurant. the food was simply incredible! i love that they prepare your baked potato table side. their steak is slow simmered so don't expect to get a steak on the &quot;rare&quot; side. we had both the cheesecake with fresh strawberries and the chocolate cake at our table, they were both to die for. the staff was great, friendly and very accommodating. will be back...hopefully real soon!
went on a date here and wanted to try something new in the chino area.have to say the place is very nice giving you a similar vibe as lazy dog, really good ambiance.the food is just okay. we ordered a steak sandwich and steak salad and started with calamari. while the ball and chain only had water to drink and for myself a ice tea.boom $48 bucks. yikesif the prices were similar to applebee's or chilis i would say good deal. but the steak on both plates is not just worth the price. calamari was very rubbery and wished they offered some type of sauce to dip.also we were overcharged for a drink we did not orderi really do not think we will be returning unless &nbsp;just drinks during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
been wanting to check this place out and finally did. a really neat restaurant. great decor and ambiance. &nbsp;the &quot;dinner for two&quot; promo they had was more food than we could handle. we will definitely return to try more on the menu. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials were also pretty good so might need to try that on my next visit.
1st time. read good reviews. &nbsp;had the joe's steak along with baked potato and rice and green beans. &nbsp;best steak ive had in my life. &nbsp;thick and juicy and tender. &nbsp;decor was ok. &nbsp;baked potato was topped off with optional bacon , chives, cream or butter. &nbsp;delicious food. &nbsp;waitress was very friendly, informative and attentive to our needs. &nbsp;would check up on us every so often..manager even introduced himself and asked if everything was ok.. would definitely go their again but next time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. &nbsp;yay
i only have one thing to say....thoroughly check your food. my husband bit into a nacho chip and immediately stood up and went to the bathroom. assuming he was done, i had them take the food away, thinking it was bad or something. therefore the concrete evidence was gone when he returned. my husband is 99% sure that there was phlegm in his nacho appetizer buried under the toppings. the chip he had was dry except for that unmistakable consistency... i won't get into the specifics, as it's making me nauseous to type this. the place was a ghost town. we were under the impression that the entire staff was trying to get out of there early as they were cleaning everything. it was 9ish when we arrived to try their 9-10 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.not to make a huge scene, we left and my husband called and spoke with the manager who apologized and offered gift cards. we declined for obvious reasons. why would we come back here for more food?!?!?spitting phlegm in someone else's food is horrifying and could transmit diseases. it's disgusting.we did not deserve this, my husband did not deserve this. he is the last person in the world who would complain about food, service etc.tahoe joe's, monitor your staff!
went here at 9 pm on sat night with a friend. &nbsp;little less than 5 min and we were seated in the bar area. ambience is bright and could be associated with nearly any restaurant, &nbsp;nothing to really set it apart. &nbsp;15 min after being seated we finally got a waitress to come by our table. ordered a couple appetizers off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu to try them. &nbsp;nachos and wings. &nbsp;nothing special about either, just avg. both of us ordered the ribeyes, mine med - rare and my friends med. when they arrived i was struck by 2 things, &nbsp;they were exceptionally thick and lacked the very tender section found on almost every ribeye i've ever had. mine was cooked correctly but lacked much flavor from lack of marbling. &nbsp;my friend's was cooked med on one end and very well done on the other. &nbsp;the sides were forgettable. the only saving grace this place had was our server was very nice, &nbsp;knowledgeable, &nbsp;and quick on the refills. &nbsp;i'll stick to woodranch for awhile till this place gets its act together.
as i sit here at the bar, i write this review. first, the place looks appealing. i was super excited to give it a try. i came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> expecting to be &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy</span>&quot;. it was everything but a &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy</span>&quot; experience. the bartender was rude, or maybe just overworked. idk. either way i thought i would give their &quot;skinny rita&quot; a shot. this thing was anything but skinny. reason being is because the bartender didn't put enough liquor/lime juice in it and proceeded to fill it up with soda. no where on the menu did it say anything about soda being added to the drink. when i asked about it, he said it was standard to put soda in the margarita. i told him then it really shouldn't be called a skinny margarita. to make a long story short, tahoe joes was not a good experience. i'll be speaking to the manager on my way out.
been here a few times now and thought i should say something about this place. i have tried many of the menu items here including steak, fish, and a few bar &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; special items. all has been a little above average except the double rack rib's and the cheese cake. both excel at what they offer. rib's meat fall off the bone and the cheese cake, well is just great. both are enough to share if you're not starving. parking is plentiful, &nbsp;on the negative side there is no wi-fi here (and they said they don't plan on getting any). great place for couples or family. it can be a bit of a challenge if you're physically challenged as getting around with a wheelchair can be tight but do-able. i recommend tahoe joe's.
first time here at tahoe joe's, it was a speer of the moment decision that my mom and i took. a key thing i have to say is the service was awesome! we were greeted and seated by kelsey she's such a sweetheart. it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so we took advantage and tried everything. our bartender noel was very knowledgeable about the menu which as guest we appreciated very much. at another point we were also engaged with another bartender justin who's very outgoing and friendly personality also gave great advice about the proper way to enjoy their sierra mary's that's served with a side of ale which is extremely good by the way. last, but definitely not least just would like to give a shout out to the management team annessa and russel truly genuine people who appreciated our feedback about our experience. the friendly staff that works here is definitely a reflection of them. i recommend this place to anyone who's looking to enjoy a sit down chow down with quality customer service and food with the modern cabin feel decor and a fireplace to match! ***the cheesecake is an absolute must don't leave with out trying it! -tamiko and jasmine
we visit tahoe joe's every so often and i am always <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with their service and food but today they were way off course. stopped by for a bogo lunch offer i received from their members club. service was at a snail's pace. the patio tables were disgusting, food in the cracks and do not look like they have been cleaned. they need to rinse them down or put place mats down (check out pics below).it took 15 minutes before my guinness arrived and that does not include the wait time before i &nbsp;ordered my beer. my rule of thumb is beer first and food second. i finished my salad before the beer showed up. i had to ask for water twice. there were no table settings for us, i don't mind asking but it can be annoying when your food is dropped off and the server runs off. beer finally arrived and we were given table settings to enjoy the food. of course, no salt or pepper at the table. i ordered the 6 oz sirloin with green beans and mashed potatoes, wife had chicken sandwich. food was great like always we just didn't appreciate being treated like second class citizens. i wasn't asked if i wanted another drink (i did want one but no one came by) and i wouldn't have ordered it anyways because i wanted to leave within the next <span class="highlighted">hour</span>. &nbsp;the computers were down so maybe that had something to do with it but still not an excuse. just because computers are down does not mean service goes out the window. taylor our server was nice but not what i am used when it comes to service when we eat at tahoe joe's. not sure if i will come back. plenty of other places to spend money and get better service.

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!
jacks is a great host as well as courtney, and the avacado rolls are amazing, especially combined with buffalo wings in my perspective. didnt get any real meals because of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, when all shareable appetizers are $2 off. how great is that!
i love bj's but their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is crappy. -$2 for shareable appetizers, -$1 for draft beers, and 50% off personal pizzas. not the greatest discounts and the portions seemed tiny. i'm on a mission to try all <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> in chino hills. so far, ra sushi and lucielle's is much better. too bad they don't hav bj's honey blonde or pale ale.
i like the beer....i like pizza...i like ice cream atop of a warm cookie. i also really love a good cheap <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i currently frequent bj's for the nutty brewnette. service here is what you'd expect from a chain restaurant...when it's good it's really good...when it's not so good...well...it's not so good. the pizza is pretty good for a chain restaurant....do i crave it...nah...do i refuse to eat it...nah...i have no complaints....but if it wasn't for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and that nutty brewnette i don't think i'd frequent bj's....
love this bjs location. we always get seated right away. if you go to the bar area be sure to arrive early if there is a popular sports game on. service is always excellent. very attentive staff. great customer service. go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sit at the bar. can't beat half off on mini pizzas!
there's nothing over-exciting about this location. u usually go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> now that ive known they don't actually brew their meet onsite anymore. mini pizzas are good value at hh but overpriced during regular times. service has been hit or miss with more misses at might since they seem to cut servers before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
they are testing a new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu which doesn't seem to be going over too well. their beer has even increased in price from 4$ to $4.50 only $2 off shareable appetizers &amp; flatbread pizza.1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas. no more mention of well drinks but a 1$ off cocktails and draft beer as well as glass of wine. if you were to compare the old &amp; new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu it is a little vague &amp; will keep the servers busy answering questions. i preferred the old one because you didn't need an actual menu to see the shareable appetizers it listed them on the table and under each price range. service is good at the restaurant and food is good. bar is great as well. lunch menu is worth it or sharing pizzas during dinner. hopefully testing will be over soon.
if this was a few years or so back, bj's restaurant &amp; brewhouse would have been 5*. &nbsp; today at most 3* and this why:1. &nbsp;although the chino hills location is newer compared to covina, covina used to have brew operations. &nbsp;if correct, many bj locations a few years back brewed on site. &nbsp;this is no longer the case. &nbsp;now, all beer is shipped in from a single location.understanding this was a business decision, it thwarted the local brewers ability to make many great &quot;one-off&quot; offerings. &nbsp;i remember getting a beer that may only be brewed in covina for example. &nbsp; local brewers would experiment with different concoctions which is no longer the case. &nbsp; chino hills (which did not brew) may be the closest location to me, but it was the unique offerings that led me to go out to covina and other locations. &nbsp;i actually enjoyed visiting multiple bj's within the region. &nbsp;2. &nbsp;bj's killed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu about a year ago. &nbsp; one thing that my family enjoyed about <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was they had a solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu with great offerings, portions, and price. &nbsp; this is not longer the case with a menu change last year with many items we've enjoyed scratched! &nbsp;also portions were cut down to size with price increases.3. &nbsp;about a year ago, bj's took away my number one item i loved on the main menu; the open face chili burger with wedge cut fries!if not visiting bj's for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and resorting to the main menu, i always got the open face chili burger. &nbsp;the piranha ale made chili was &quot;bomb.com!&quot; &nbsp;the only time i can get chili now is during lunch with the giant stuffed potato or in a sourdough bowl. &nbsp;both very good, but it's not the same as having that open faced chili burger i loved so much.all these changed happened right when the chino hills location got up and running. &nbsp;i recall the server in chino hills stating that chino hills was a test place for the so called &quot;crappy&quot; new and more healthier menu. &nbsp;bj's wanted to change their image ... personally i don't know why? &nbsp; maybe they wanted more of a wine crowd.ok, on to today... my family and i frequent bj's at least once a month (used to be 5-6/month) mainly for a change up from other now better gastropubs and the seasonal beer offerings which two of my favorites are the pumpkin ale and grand cru. &nbsp; i can drink their grand cru daily; it's that good if into belgian style of beers. &nbsp;their pumpkin is always solid, but since going to consolidated brewing i recall one year they had it forever while another another they ran out fast and we missed it.consolidated brew operations don't bother me as much the menu change last year. &nbsp; it's really the menu change; especially <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, that caused my family not to frequent bj's as much as we used to. &nbsp; as i write this, i still can't believe they killed what was an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as well taking the open chili face burger off the menu to make way for more healthier items. &nbsp; when drinking a good beer, i want hearty good beer food. &nbsp;with that menu change they should be making wine instead of beer; seriously!bring back the old bjs! &nbsp; bring back the open face chili burger at least! &nbsp; how can you scratch something that was made with your own beer product. &nbsp; if i want something more healthier, i'll go a few buildings down to souplantation!
best thing about bj's ... <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. most hh in chino hills end at 6pm, bj's ends at 7pm. the down part is hh is only in the bar area and if you don't get there early or are not aggressive, you won't be able to get a table.
went for late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the food was decent, the drinks were good, and the service was great. as a group we ordered boneless buffalo wings(kind of a small serving and the chicken pieces were small) mini deep dish pizzas(always good from bj's)and potstickers(kind of soggy) lemon drop martini tasted like cleaning solution, irish root beer was delicious and the strawberry mojito was tasty. for dessert we shared a beignet(tasted super doughy and nothing like what it usually tastes like) and an oreo pizookie(always good). our total came out to $75, not a real good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price- we could've gone to yard house and gotten all that plus more for half the price. our server jamie was very attentive and did a great job.
i came in becuase i got a coupon in my email for buy one entree get one free. they didn't even ask for it lol. overall everything was great ..<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices were great and service was very attentive. my only complaint is that i was served obviously bad seared tuna....the server promptly brought new stuff but the fact that it was served to me in the first place makes me wonder. i will return but might opt for the pizzas (which have always been amazing). that and the pazookies are worth any wait :) i would recommend this one just not entrusting the serving of quality under cooked food ...... pizza and cookies all the way!
if you've had bjs at one place, it's the same at any other chain. &nbsp;so as far as service, this place was pretty great. &nbsp;lively and fun atmosphere, especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and because it's football season the bar area had plenty of tv action... &nbsp;and beer... phenomenal... i'm not a beer drinker at all... so waitress gave us 5 different beers to sample for free before ordering. &nbsp;their fruity beers were the ones that appealed to me. &nbsp;so the seller for this place is great service and free beer (samples)!
bjs chino hills - you try so hard to create an attractive entertaining place to eat, drink and watch sports. yet, your kitchen royalty messed up our <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> meal. bjs in irvine is much better in comparison.i didn't expect an extra order of salt with my mediterrenean (chicken) pizza...and who stole the chicken go? there was some leftover bits! we tried to finish it and even picked out the salty olives, but there was no saving this pizza! :( &nbsp; the boneless chicken wings weren't much better....luke warm and soggy. at least we managed to eat these. the advocado egg rolls can't be faulted...highly edible.the evening shift might be the trainees. it might be the salt-<span class="highlighted">happy</span> chef. whatever it was...it was very memorable. in a bad way. best stick to bjs irvine.
pizza review: bj's is &quot;ok&quot; when it comes to pizza. they're about the only place in chino hills that serves a deep-dish pizza, but they don't make it right. the crust is way too fluffy and there's too little sauce to classify it as a real deep-dish. a true deep dish has a regular or flat crust, with toppings piled in the middle, coated with cheese and sauce. not here... it's like a regular pizza, but with a fluffy crust and limited sauce.atmosphere is nice and dark, usually playing 80's music. lots of tv monitors showing the various sports games. staff is usually excellent and friendly.they have a special <span class="highlighted">happy-hour</span> appetizer/drink special in the bar, sun-thu, after 10pm.
this place is great to go watch the laker game or any sporting event. they have a bunch of tvs at the bar and then random tvs all over the restaurant.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 3-7 p.m. monday thru friday and after 10 p.m. i think on all nights except for friday and saturday. their beers are a $1 off and their appetizers are cheaper too. i usually come here for the beer, the jeremiah red is the best one. there's a ton of these all over, but i usually prefer the chino hills location because i think the server's are great here.
i come here to hang with friends sometimes. perfect if a game is on since the bar is right there in front of a few huge big screens. haven't really indulged into their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu yet, but they do have a good selection of house beers on tap. the red is pretty amazing, and if you want something syrupy around 10%, go for the tatonka stout. their spaghetti here is pretty damn good and so are the nachos. the few things i would change with this place (which probably isn't possible with the current layout) - their bar area needs to be a lot bigger. it takes a good 20 minutes of waiting sometimes to be able to snag a seat up on that level. i would also suggest they do what yardhouse does and rotate some local micro brews through their selection of beers on tap. this place doesn't tend to get as crowded as the local yardhouse, so maybe a good alternative on friday and saturday night.
great americanized food with one really super dessert. yes there is some hit and miss in this place but when you order right you will be a definite fan. decor: standard but their tvs is not my taste. i wish they were bigger and more spread out especially for game day or laker day. the one in the middle ( of the bar) splits the game in 6 screens showing different things (usually sports related) but i only like that for football not basketball. we are socal people, im pretty sure most people watch lakers than regular sportscenter or nascar. the bar is pretty spacious and to get into <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, you have to eat there. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 3-7 on weekdays, sun to thurs 10pm to close. 1/2 off mini pizzas; 2$ off sharable appetizers &amp; classic sliders &amp; $2 off flatbread appetizer pizza. pretty good but i like half off appetizers like the other <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> i been to (ie yardhouse) busyness: went on a holiday monday around 330pm. very fast to get in or out. gone here on weekends, pretty crazy. that's why i usually avoid this place unless i'm really willing to wait around. food: love the scampi pasta! i usually order this and you can request a side of panko bread crumbs if you like. i love putting extra panko bread crumbs. they give you a lot of shrimp and their portions are great for their food but you will usually need a box unless you're sharing. some good choices: avocado egg rolls ( heard the cpk one is better but haven't tried it) gourmet mac and cheese spinach dip great white pizza strawberry splash drink did not like the chicken marsala. so bland. bj's favorite (pizza) was pretty good but i don't know if i call it favorite. pizza gets kinda generic sometimes. but last but not least do order the pizookie. i enjoy this so much everytime i go. it's a must and i feel like i die and go to heaven i eat here. i prefer though when they kept the pizookie in one tin and not splitting it into two smaller tins though when you want to split the flavor. you have to dig and everything gets crusty at the bottom of the smaller tin and it becomes harder to get the rest of the cookie =(. they give a lot of ice cream with the cookie which is awesome. i hate when they don't give enough. i like the white chocolate macadamia nut and the classic chocolate chip. for someone's bday they will give a small pizookie but boo no more singing. service was really great and they check on us multiple times. however it wasn't busy so i dont think they are always like this.
usually go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after 10pm. i like it better than yard house. it's good for a quick bite, drink, &amp; dessert!drinks:- strawberry splash: good tropical drink, not strong- raspberry lemon drop martini: a little stronger but love the sugar rim =)- non alcoholic: orange cream soda is another yummy option. free refills!usuals- gourmet mac and cheese: its from the small bite section, but portion is actually decent &amp; filling- bruschetta: nice and fresh- spinach dip: my fav spinah dip!- pizza: great white or spinach&amp; artichoke. not authentic deep dish pizza but still tastey.dessert- white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie!!- the oreo is pretty good too. place is chill. couple tvs-no sound though. service is okay. better than some other bjs i've been to.
been here for a birthday dinner last friday and i have to say, service was great, food was good and the drinks were well made. &nbsp;it was my niece's bday and she had a large group of high school friends come out to celebrate with her. &nbsp;the group was a good 15 plus. &nbsp;there were adults too, but we took over the 2 booths next to them. &nbsp;the hostess was really good at saving the booths for our group, since more came than expected orginally. &nbsp;since everyone was paying for their own meal, there was no problem splitting the check here. &nbsp;the waitress, i think her name was courtney, was great. &nbsp;she was really on top of things and very attentive. &nbsp; &nbsp; bj's chino hills is a good spot for groups and price is reasonable. &nbsp;they have a mini appetizer menu with prices ranging form $3-$6 bucks. &nbsp;they're good with late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too, from 10pm to close. &nbsp;too bad it's not available for the weekends.
one of my favorite places to go for a good dining experience. i will keep my review short sweet and to the point. one of the best places to me to come when you first turn 21 to have a first time drink. they offer great classic cocktails and of course there own brewed beer. i enjoyed my first time coming her and ordering a flight of beer tastings and discovering very good examples of different styles of beers. the waiters have a good knowledge of these and other beers that are not there own at the bar and are good and making great suggestions. my absolute favorite is beer is the nutty brewnette always have that every time i come in. along with this they have a great variety of different styles of food from a traditional burger to freshly baked pizza. i always recommend people going during there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> since they offer many discounted items including special on there house beers.overall, i enjoy my experiences and will always come here for the overall experience. cant wait to visit bjs again soon.
went here with a large group of classmates. terrible service, our waitress was incredibly rude and had an attitude, she wouldn't give us <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices because we didn't sit in the bar area even though the waitress that seated us before said we could because we had such a large group, she refilled our waters one time, food came out late and cold like it had been sitting out and when we confronted her about it all she said was &quot;we're really backed up&quot; (it was a monday night), the waitress wouldn't split the check for us and on top of all that, two of us got food poisoning from the spinach!! never again. next time we'll stick with yard house. they always have great service and great food.
also smaller in size than the average bj's, and no brewery here. &nbsp;i see a trend...from the outside, that lucille's that is opening also looks mighty tiny compared to other lucille's. &nbsp;i really think that chino hills city planning may have something to do with this. &nbsp;anyhow, i will now move on. &nbsp;i promise:this bj's is really pretty, and i love the setup. &nbsp;apparently, lots of people do, because it is always packed. &nbsp;the entire section of the parking lot is always full. &nbsp;sometimes i feel like every single person in this bj's decided they's drive themselves and there is literally one car per person in the restaurant. &nbsp;the bar area is tiny; barstools, one row of hightop tables, a row of small booths and like, 2 group booths. &nbsp;then there are 2 dining areas. &nbsp;one that can potentially be roped off for groups and parties and such. &nbsp;there is also a completely different window and waiting area for takeout orders- they get their own little nook.the wait on the friday night we went was bearable, since i'd already reached and passed my point of starvation and was now in the hunger-denial portion of my night. &nbsp;we were seated and proceeded to order drinks. &nbsp;i gave my extremely choosy drink order to the extremely friendly waitress and when it was gross the first time around, she made sure to get me another so it would be right. &nbsp;i do appreciate this, because for me, drinking a pint glass full of overly sweet liquid is not an option. &nbsp;my boyfriend had already eaten, and so i just got the balsamic glazed chicken. &nbsp;it was so good! &nbsp;i loved it. &nbsp;i asked for no mashed potatoes, i just wanted some sliced tomato on the side, and girl, it was the best quasi-salad i have had. &nbsp;chicken was so tender and juicy for breast meat, and the onion straws over top were perfect. &nbsp;so good, i can't believe i'm still talking about bj's, land of dishwater mashed potatoes and soggy banquet vegetable mix.i like bj's, especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with long islands in pint glasses. &nbsp;so, i am <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about this opening so close to the bf's house. &nbsp;we'll surely treat it as we do any bj's- - it's there when you need it.
wood-ranch-chino-hills
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if your on a budget our server luke and busboy were very attentive and answered all our questions thank you great staff
this was my first ever wood ranch i ever tried out on the recommendation of my girl friends. we were all in this area for work and they suggested we meet here at wood ranch for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i want say <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is mon-fri 3-6p. we had about an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to take advantage of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special by the time we arrived. seating in the bar area wasn't too bad around 5p.spinach-artichoke dip $5- it's a small portion and we felt the dip was salty. they give you a lot of chips though (chips don't look homemade) fresh guacamole &amp; chips $5- again, tiny portion of guacamole compared to amount of chips they give you. the guac was ok but nothing specialkiller wings $5- they let us choose two flavors which was nice of them. i think we did the habanero and buffalo. the wings were dry. we did appreciate the ample amount of fresh carrots and celery though.i can't remember what we had to drink from their hh menu that evening (and noooo, not because we drank a lot). i just can't find any pics of the drinks. i just tried calling them to inquire about their hh drink options and the host couldn't tell me a thing about it. their website also makes no mention of what drinks or food is available during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you know the absolute best part of the meal. i know i should say the company with my awesome girlfriends but hey, let's keep it real. it was the *free* garlic rolls man. they were so frekkin' amazing. this is a beautiful restaurant and nice location. too bad the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu wasn't better and i can't figure out what drinks we had that night. they recently opened a new location in san diego so hoping the food is a bit better.
i've been dying to come here but my friends and family had told me it wasn't spectacular. i can happily say i was pleasantly surprised. i was expecting outrageous prices but my boyfriend got a steak (ribeye i think) and he said it's one of the only charbroiled steaks he's ever really liked. my boyfriend loves steak and hates charbroiled so i think that says a lot. as for price his steak was $20 or so i think, so nothing crazy (like some other local &quot;famous steakhouses&quot;). i got <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food because i wasn't too hungry but there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was great! $5 for a huge plate of wings and $5 for two pulled pork sliders that were good. cole slaw wasn't special but the pulled pork bbq sauce was good! we also got giant craft beers for i think $3-$4. and the best part? it wasn't too loud or crowded like some places get. it was a nice, enjoyable <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> meal. well done!
this place has so much potential but always seems to be lacking. now that there is another major steak place in chino hills, maybe they'll get on their game. &nbsp;food is consistent, average. service consistent, good. prices are high considering what you get. if wood ranch doesn't hit the spot, try tahoe joes a couple miles away (especially the ribs, there is no comparison). they need to bring back their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. bar area is dead since they killed that (even though they had good food specials).
came here for a late lunch/ early dinner...and found out it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! how awesome is that?! anyways i had to have my required dose of their mac n cheese so i had the lunch combo with bbq tri tip sliders and mac n cheese. it comes with soup too but alas i ran out of tummy space. more importantly, i drank the raspberry ranch lemonade...holy sh*t!! it was amazing!! it had fresh raspberries muddled in there yum!! man i love this place!!
this would be our second time having dinner here. their prime rib has been consistently good. good bbq sauce! my husband and i ordered their pick three combo for roughly $25 bucks a plate along with their delicious clam chowder soup. the plate came with two sides, and we choose mac and cheese and fries. the beef brisket was tender, great ribs, and chicken was moist. they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 3 to 6 pm. ambiance was nice and warm. charles was the name of our server. if a server can predict what you want before asking, they deserve a 5 for excellent service on a busy night. host was nice and proactive. hats off to management for a well ran ship. by the time i realized i needed to take picture of the rest of the dishes, more than 50 percent of the dish was gone. :)
this is only my second time here, the first time being before my yelp days. i came in last week for a second <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with a colleague, still full from the first <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the wait at yardhouse was 20-25 minutes and being that we were at the tail end of a long day, we weren't in the mood to wait. the wait at wood ranch was 5-10 minutes with us being seated near the 5 minute mark. almost instantly, our drink order was taken. i had the lost coast tangerine wheat and it was perfect. i love blue moon and hangar 24 orange wheat, lc tangerine wheat is now officially in the rotation. the two of us are simple folk who just wanted a simple appetizer, chips and salsa. i'm a guacamole fiend and our server let us know that the chips and guac appetizer came with salsa... perfect!!! my companion ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and i snacked on the free bread, i couldn't convince myself that i was hungry enough for a second dinner. the guac was good, the chips salty and plentiful, the bread delicious. our service was great, very sweet considering that the restaurant was closing within the <span class="highlighted">hour</span>. overall, we had a great experience!
i love this place. like any establishment there are errors, every time i order to-go orders, something is always missing, usually my asparagus or mash potatoes, mainly side orders because i order a lot over whats provided with the meal. understandable, one phone call and they keep your information for the next time you come in to reimburse you that. the service is outstanding, the food is even better. a meal between me and my fiance is about $120 not including tip, but we usually tip very generously. best i mean the best filet mignon. the smell and flavor of the wood in your steak lingers, and even when i take it home for the next day, reheating makes a whole room smell like the wood chips they use. i def. recommend it here. i usually dress very casual or sometimes in work out clothes, there is no dress code, more of an older crowd, but best food you can get. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is actually better and more portioned than bj's an exit away. this is by far my favorite place for a good for sure filet mignon and buffalo wings. their mac and cheese is to die for, even better than mastros.
first time to a wood ranch ever and i must say, i should've expected this. when you want bbq, definitely look for a hole in the wall because you won't find great bbq here. don't get me wrong, it's edible and fills you up but lacking so much flavor.so the first thing that came out was the garlic rolls. the garlic was smothered on and looked a bit scary. i gave it a try anyways and wow, either the bread has been left out under the heat lamp for a long time or they got the bread couple days ago because it was extremely stale and chewy, the kind where you bit down and had to pull extremely hard. we thought this was the bad sign in the beginning, however it turned out to be one the most flavorful things there.entree that was ordered was half baby back ribs and tri-tip with sweet mashed potato and baked potato sides along with their signature bbq chicken chopped salad. i also asked for the salad dressing on the side but they still got a bit too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with their bbq sauce in the salad. their bbq sauce tasted like italian dressing and overall the salad was nothing out of the ordinary. they were a bit skimpy with their servings of white corn and beans in the salad. the ribs didn't fall off the bone although it was said by our waitress to have been slowly roasted for more than eight <span class="highlighted">hours</span> in their ovens. tri-tip could not be cooked to medium rare...because they just don't. baked potato was dry and sweet mashed potatoes were decent until about the fifth bite before it becomes a bit much.the dessert menu didn't have too much on it, about four or five items. however, i did see that they made their cheesecakes in house. i didn't try it though because the food wasn't impressive.overall, it is a typical chain restaurant. the service there was up to par but the food left me speechless. although before i left they handed me a coupon for my next visit, free dessert with a purchase of an entree....the latter is asking for a bit much from me, so i will have to pass.
buffalo-wild-wings-chino-hills
terrible service. i was going to give this place a chance even after the poor reviews, however, they are accurate. i tried calling about the &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; times and i had a extremely rude hostess pick up. she was not informed about the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and too lazy to pick up a menu or ask someone. she hung up on me! belive the reviews, i won't be giving this place any of my business and i will tell everyone i know of my poor experience.
it's a buffalo wild wings. it's neither great, it borders low average. there's &nbsp;cheap prices to be had if you are in the right time of day. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4-6, 10-close. cheap wings on tues and thurs.
wings and boneless wings here are great. love coming here tuesdays, thursdays, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. great place to watch games and hang out with friends. if you come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, get the nachos (the big one thats like $10) its huge!! and during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> its super cheap so its worth every bite. you can probably split it between 3 and get really full. the beer selection is pretty good too. i was just <span class="highlighted">happy</span> they had lagunitas ipa hahabut yea i only come here for wings nachos and beers so if thats what you want than this is the place.
i love this buffalo wild wings! the guys and gals that serve in the bar are so nice and do an amazing job, i've never had a bad experience! i personally love the bonelesswings in hot buffalo sauce! the salads (chicken cesar and buffalo) are also amazing! they have buffalo fries on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu sometimes that are very snacky along with great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink prices!
food is great as always. service slow as always, saw them all talking in the corner while my mouth was on fire and could of used a refill but overall great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> good prices! i'd recommend.
so i went here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and it was packed to the tee.the service was understandably slow, but at times it was very hard to get the attention of the waiter. we ordered the boneless wings that were on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special and got all kinds of flavors because of the deal. &nbsp;of the 5 flavors we got, including original, teriyaki, and parmesan garlic, i liked about none. and i love wings, so this was a huge disappointment. &nbsp;maybe i will try bone in one day.
love buffalo wild wings! great place to watch games, <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, and good food.my personal favorite flavors are: asian zing (spicy), desert heat (dry rub), and mango habanero (not for the light hearted!)pros: good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and good tuesday and thursday wing deals!late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: monday-thursday &amp; sundays 10pm- close (1/2 off most appetizers &amp; drink specials starting at $2.50 pint domestic, $3.50 tall domestic draft and $4.50 tall premium draft!)wing tuesdays: 55 cents for wingsboneless wings thursdays: 65 cents for boneless wings.cons: it can get really packed at this location, especially on game days. i've been lucky a lot of times of finding a spot at the bar. they have more bar seating than other bars that i've been to.
this is a good chicken place, i lova dis place. the wings are cheap in tues and thurs, it's like a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> there. =d get all of them, and if your a real man, get blazin....
never again. at least for me. too crowded, horrible service, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, extremely pricey, cold food. everything you hate about dining out! even for a &quot;bar&quot;. corporate places are all seemingly the same. overpricing america
buffalo wild wings is only worth it to me on tuesday, wednesday, and thursday when they have their deals. their wings are very tasty, but a bit pricey for me on any other day. they have an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too!
good place to drink and watch the games. food is whatevers. sometimes they dont put enough sauce on the wings, or they give really small pieces. service is usually on the slow side. they have good deals for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, cheap appetizers. i mainly come here to drink at the bar and catch a game. overall, chill place to drink with friends and get appetizers. if im craving wings ill go to wingstop instead.
wings &amp; drinks and game 4 of the nba finals. i'm a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> man! even happier when i can just waltz in and get a table in 10 minutes 15 minutes before tip-off. and even happier when i walk in and its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!! yay! just like any other bww you order wings, some drinks, and watch sports on one of their 100000 tvs. on tuesdays <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4-7pm?) most appetizers are 50% off, traditional (bone) wings are 55 cents each, and there are good deals on drinks too. for flavors, you have to order at least 6 wings per flavor.i tried the carribean jerk, parmesean garlic, spicy garlic, hot, and mild. all were pretty good. the hotter wings are actually pretty spicy (coming from a guy who loves spicy food). still the wings were cooked in a way that aren't anything to write home about.i should probably give it 4 stars because of its ability to deliver on a major sporting event + their awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal but i feel like it should be more of a general review of the place itself. the food is just a-okay, its the environment that really makes up for it.anyways, lebron james still sucks.
i used to not really dig this place for the food, but being with my significant other, he's got me liking wings a lil bit more. garlic parmesan is bomb, i dig asian thai chili status flavored wings. prices, i only think it's worth it durning <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. drinks included... i guess they're standard prices, but we all know those can get pricy without those <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. i love their french fries. i like getting their salted vinegar salt on the side. customer service varies. some of the hotter girls have stuck up attitudes, but the guys are usually cool, and the plain jane chicks are tight. during a game, shit gets packed and rowdy. some days, late at night, they have karaoke. unfortunately, i'm guilty of participating.
love the place, but hate their system. there was clearly enough seats to fill everyone that was waiting and yet, we still have to wait over 15 minutes. other than that inconvenience, i love the food. gotta have the basket of potato wedges during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and try the dry seasonings.
i've been here several times with friends and always during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. its never crowded, but the service seems as if it is.my reason for one star: 1. the wings are always inconsistent. they're either in a soup of sauce, or barely have any. 2. the servers are rude. one guy hardly checked on our table, and we had to go up to the register to get our bill. we asked him to put a certain amount on each card, and what ever balance was left over to put on any card he chose. this was too difficult for him and pretty much threw a fit, then split our checks. why couldn't he have done that in the first place? another time a woman was our server and she tossed the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu at my friend after she asked what was on special. rude. she also argued about what was on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and then reluctantly gave us our discount (they were domestic beers, but was claiming coors isn't). i love bww but the staff here sucks. if you can't handle customer service get a different job.
not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> un satisfied customer it was the 3 of us the fries were cold hard &amp; you pay extra just to get them my burger that was 12 dollars was nasty it was not as i remember from the time before &nbsp;the wings were big as a whole chicken leg the margarita was very weak we were charged &nbsp;7 dollars for one beer a price it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> the check was wrong and the sever was not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> when she had to fix it she brought it to the table it was worse than before im getting upset with this hole situation , the manager is dumb as hell too im never coming here again .......
buffalo wild wings is a place where you can be as loud and rowdy as you'd like. however, ever since they have increased their prices while decreasing the quantity of wings, i would prefer going to wingstop.here are the prices for the wings:traditional wings- snack 7.29, small 12.99, medium 18.49, large 21.49. boneless wings- snack 8.99, small 12.99, medium 18.49, large 21.49note: there is no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on the weekends.signature sauces: sweet bbq, teriyaki, honey mustard, mild, parmesan garlic, medium, honey bbq, spicy garlic, jammin jalapeno, asian zing, caribbean jerk, thai curry, hot bbq, hot, mango habanero, wild, blazin.dry seasonings: salt and vinegar, lemon pepper, chipotle bbq, buffalo, desert heat.in summary, i will probably only come here for large group gatherings. otherwise, go to wingstop for the quality and better prices.
what can i say that i just love this place! the wings are the best wings i ever ate, their flavors are amazing especially the mango habanero one! their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great with good selections on food and beer. i usually like going on tuesdays though because they have traditional wings for 70 cents each all day and if you like bone its the same but on thursdays. and last they have variety of beers on tap too! overall i love this place and enjoy coming here all the time when i get the chance
this is the buffalo wings place to go.... when you're in townlots of sauces, 50 cent wings during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, manga habenero should be illegal cause its so damn good and spicy.sports bar, packed when there are games, but what do your expect. i want to take my friends here. the sauces are delish. end of story. hooters can't compare, i do not cares about oyo this place is the best.
this place is on good on sundays, not just because of football, but because they have a late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that starts at 10pm ($3 beers, half off appetizers), karaoke and a club like atmosphere with some of ies hottest women. i highly recommend you go then.
this bww is average for bww, the sliders are great, and the staff is nice, but it just gets soooooo packed. &nbsp;the movie theater is right next door, so it's a bummer when you try to drop in for a quick beer and there is literally no where to sit or even stand at the bar (and that's on a week night). &nbsp;best bet is going during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> before it gets too busy, which is hard with a busy work schedule.
this place is one of our regular places. it's great on wednesday or thursday nights if you don't mind a little bit a wait. thursday nights are a little bit packed, depending on what game is on that night. service is a little slow, but that is completely understandable. i love their boneless wings and they give great service to my large group of friends. servers and waiters/waitresses are very friendly- even when it's late at night. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (after 10pm) is a amazing, even their drinks are pretty inexpensive and very tasty! overall, always a fun place to go!
i love this place especially the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! the only thing i dislike is the service at the chino hills location. we went and they started asking for our order before we looked at the menu. then when we were finally ready our waiter kept walking by and ignoring us. so we left. bad service! go to brea!!!
lets all admit we come here for the wings tuesday!!deals- all day till closingtuesdays- 55 traditional wings all day (traditional as in bones in)wednesdays- 65 cents any wing wednesdays (traditional and boneless)thursdayss- 65 cents boneless wingsbest flavors-parmesan garlic!!<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> varies but mostly withing 3-7pmtip- do not come when there is a game on...you will be waiting at least an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>...like all locations limited seating and slow service and slow food which adds on why people spend a good <span class="highlighted">hour</span>+ there..best time to come after 9 when the crowds die down!dislikes-order a &quot;basket&quot; of fries...it was seriously the amount you get from in and out maybe a bit more...-_-
while i'm typing this my fingers still smell of teriyaki sauce and my lips are slightly sticky. gross. i know. but i still want to say what a great time i had tonight! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! here we gooo! the music is bumpin' and the people are lickin' their fingers! it's a party in here!food: it's not of epic proportions or ambrosia for the gods, but tonight i was starvin' marvin' and i was ready to tear through the place. i hated the 20+ min wait (longest i've ever waited at a a bww) and i literally complained through the roof (starvation can do that to a person), but when we sat down, ordered, and the food arrived (fries and 6 boneless teriyaki wings) it was pretty awesome and worth every minute. the shell of the chicken was too hard for my liking, but under the circumstances i ate it anyways because the insides was still deliciousss! the fries are nothing special, really- but addictingly good. the teriyaki was overly salty (as i am gulping down massive amount of water right now), and it left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. got a little hard finishing the chicken in the end.service: was the turnaround for tonight! special thanks to nick, our waiter! he was funny, patient (as it seemed i was so hungry i was talking gibberish when ordering... lol), and just very outgoing. he cracked jokes, chatted with us when filling our water. just a really cool guy. i've had my share of waiters and waitresses at bww, most of them are nice and very attentive, but rarely conversational. he made our night pretty fun! :)we were full and we were satisfied! there's no question: bww- i'll be coming back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> soon, see you later!food: 3 starsservice: 4 stars
bartender chick needs to find another job. i understand we came in after a rush but you have to keep a poker face in this business. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu advertised a certain beer that they didn't even carry, so naturally, i asked her if she could sub for the same type and she got all bent outta shape. i ordered a different beer but then she insisted on asking a manager because she thought i had a problem. after i ordered anyways?! she was a snob for the rest of the night. the manager had the same idgaf attitude and said &quot;yeah we don't sub beers for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot;. at that point i straight told him that's false advertising if you don't actually carry the beer your offering. he just shrugged his shoulders and walked off.the level of professionalism is out the window here. my friends and i watched this sad, depressed bartender chick tell everyone about us as if we were the nightmare guests of the night. no smile, no enthusiasm, not one hint of kindness. i worked in the business almost 10 years trust me, i knew exactly what she was doing and it was completely absurd. we felt sorry for her. she got a pity tip even though she deserved zilch. the food here is crap everyone knows that. the sports and the service is all they have and yet even management is a joke.
well what can i say... i absolutely hate this buffalo wild wings! my husband and i live in pomona and rather drive further to the one in west covina to get better service than go to the one that is close to home and receive terrible service! the first time we went there it took forever to get our drinks and food, so i shrugged it off because it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and pretty packed. the second time there was only us and like two other people there and still took a ridiculous amount of time to get our food and drinks, and we asked for more ranch and it never came. so then the hubby and i decided we would only get take out from there, when i called they put me on hold for ten min and then hung up on me! i called two times after that and was hung up on every time! so we still continue to drive further to go to west covina for the way better service, i've given chino many chances and they have proved to suck every time !
this place took forever for everything!! an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> wait just to get a table, at least 30 minutes to get a beer. and another 15 minutes after that to get our food.. did i mention that we didn't even get all of our food at the same time? i'm currently waiting for an order of celery/carrots... i mean seriously? how long is this going to take? service is seriously lacking here. they didn't even take our menus away... no water refills yet. plus our mozzarella sticks were missing the mozzarella. what? &nbsp;i don't even know how they fried it without the mozzarella inside...otherwise the food is okay. nothing amazing but good finger foods to go with some beer. there are other locations that are much better than this one that offer the same food (it is a chain afterall...) the only thing good was the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal.
decided to give this place another try since i do love their wings, even though their service is crap. went on a sunday night at midnight..found out mondays and sundays after 10pm are 50cent wings :d so far, so good.they have a bunch of different <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> and deals throughout the week, so ask them about it. our waiter told us all of them nicely. we ordered asian zings *all time fave wings* and mango habanero. sweet and spicy!! sooo good!!!! these wings are my favorite wings of alllll time. no other places has flavors like the ones offered here. the only reason why i don't give more stars is because service still sucks. it was better this time, but still crap. we had to bring our bill up to our server cuz we were waiting forever again. i'd rather just order the wings to go...
when you're a broke college student, 50cent tues, 55cent wed, &amp; 65cent thurs are your best friends. 6 wings for $3 is definitely a catch! their different flavors are all bomb. personal favorites would be asian zing &amp; mango habanero. chino hills bww has the best service out of all the bwws although sometimes the patio service is kind of lacking. do keep in mind of what games are going on because your wait could be up to an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> or two. also check out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (from 4 - 6pm?) because all appetizers are half off too! so think about it... 50cent trad'l wings tues &nbsp;plus half off appetizers?! freaking delicious annd cheap.good place for parties. last night had 3 birthdays (2 of whom are part of a fraternity) and we took up the entire back station. great service from sarah! no complaints on how organized and efficient our servers and food delivery was. oh and if you're a lakers fan, chino hills will always be crackin! just sayin'!
all i gotta say is $0.50 wings! they're normally $4.99 for 6 (this is the min. order) but on tuesdays you get 'em (6) for $3!i've been to this location about a dozen times, mostly for their tue/thu specials. &nbsp;the traditional wings are much better than the boneless. on my last visit, the waitress told us some of the appetizers were half off. so my buddy and i split an order of nachos for less than $4. on our way out we found out that beers were on special too but we didn't get to ask for how much. i don't know if they have an official <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but we were pretty satisfied.service is usually quick, except when it's packed during sporting events. tip: ask for celery to douse your tongue a little when it gets too hot. the asian zing, mango habanero, and caribbean jerk are all good. the honey bbq and garlic parmesan are passable as well.
definitely the best wing place around this area and way better than hooters (though i may be biased since i'm a girl). i think the honey bbq is the best sauce but i've tried pretty much all of the different sauces and they are all really goodi love the nachos here too. i only had a problem one time with the chips being kind of stale but the waiter was really cool when we told him and he brought us out new ones and ended up giving it to us for free. service is great here. i usually sit in the bar area to watch the big screens. it's a great place to watch any and all sporting events but it can get pretty busy during game time so be sure to come either before the game starts or at half time. they also have a really good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i think its 3-7 monday thru friday and most of their appetizers are half off.
yesterday we experienced what rudeness &nbsp;really means when it comes to customer appreciation. &nbsp;the phone table ready system &nbsp;totally sucks. &nbsp;they call you when your table is ready but god forbid if you miss the call because &nbsp;it's too noisy or you're &nbsp;in the restroom, &nbsp;etc. last night was extremely &nbsp;busy due to the mexico soccer game, no problem it's a sports bar. it was extremely &nbsp;noisy, but we were sitting directly &nbsp;across the &nbsp;hostess for 20 minutes waiting, 3 feet from us. we went up to her and stated we had just missed our &nbsp;call. she said we just gave our table &nbsp;away. &nbsp;and there's a 2 to 3 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> wait for the next table really! did you &nbsp;not &nbsp;see us seated right in front of your face? she said yes but their system &nbsp;is to call you. really we requested to &nbsp;speak to the manager. i realize it was noisy but she &nbsp;started yelling at us &quot; that's our policy to call, we don't have to call anyone's name out, we don't have to wave at you just because &nbsp;you're &nbsp;sitting &nbsp;across from the hostess. it's a 2 to 3 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> wait, can't you see were full, where would you like to sit if there's no tables. &quot;how about the patio?&quot; she stated i don't have a server for the patio, so are you going to wait the 2 to 3 hrs or not? she was rude, impolite, and obviously &nbsp;was very fustrated. &nbsp; i realize &nbsp;it was busy, but on a night that you know it's going to be that busy, open the patio, be prepared. &nbsp;so we left went to chili's &nbsp;where we enjoyed our <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and game. my routine of buying gift cards for family and friends will not include buffalo wild wings &nbsp;gift cards ever again. get a management &nbsp;adjustment!
the short review: think hooters, minus the boobs and booty shorts.the long review: after our date at harkins theaters over the weekend, we were both feeling hungry (we didn't know that divergent would run almost 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, not including previews). &nbsp;seeing how i'd never been to a buffalo wild wings and kathy had only been there once for drinks, we decided to check it out.the place was pretty busy - baseball season had just started, the ncaa tournament was in full effect, and there were a number of parties going on. &nbsp;b-dubs (as they call it) has plenty of large flat-screen tvs showing various events, as well as numerous sports memorabilia from both los angeles and san diego teams; definitely a sports bar vibe happening here.kathy had never tried fried pickles before, so i ordered some as an appetizer to start with. &nbsp;we both liked them - plus the coating is a bit more crispier than hooters' version. &nbsp;as for our order, we split the half regular, half boneless combo - the boneless had the parmesan garlic (which was a bit on the creamy side) and the regular had the asian zing (a sweet chili, soy, and ginger sauce that was our favorite). &nbsp;the wings pretty much are cooked like hooters' wings are, but the asian zing definitely made them stand out. &nbsp;the fries were ok, but the coleslaw was definitely good - so good, i ordered an extra side of it!our server - who was tastefully dressed - was very helpful; she brought out samples of the sauces we were considering with a few tortilla chips and also made sure our iced teas were refilled.yes, buffalo wild wings can get pretty expensive, but those <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, wing tuesday, and boneless thursday specials look promising. &nbsp;plus, props to the place for recognizing lent with friday specials. &nbsp;think we'll be back, and i also want to check out the one near my place in san diego as well.
went here last night with the boyfriend and we generally go for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which is from 3-7pm monday-fridays. &nbsp;they have 1/2 off appetizers, which is amazing especially since we love getting the spinach artichoke dip with pita chips and the deep fried mushrooms. &nbsp;both served hot(!) so be careful before taking a bite right away.honestly this is just your regular american sports bar. &nbsp;i don't expect the food to be <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fbomb.com&amp;s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bomb.com</a> or the service to be all that great. &nbsp;it's just one of those laid back places where you can just chill and watch whatever game is on. &nbsp;i actually don't watch sports so it really doesn't matter to me, but perfect for a get together with friends if you don't want to hold a sports party at your place. &nbsp;i have been here on a game day and it's pretty intense. &nbsp;just make sure to get there early because a lot of people may not eat the entire time but they'll sit there just to watch a game which slims your chances of getting a table.for me this place can be too loud. &nbsp;the service was okay. &nbsp;i like my servers to be on their feet as far as drinks. &nbsp;i just remember asking the server to refill my boyfriend's drink but we kind of sat there waiting for quite some time. &nbsp;eventually, the boyfriend drank all of my water and yeah, we were pretty thirsty by the end of the night...like i said, just a regular sports bar... don't have your hopes too high.lina chen
all bad... i can't believe the waiter told that i don't have to be rude when i was being silly and joking. so we go for late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all fun whatev so i want to order another drink. we're sitting at the bar area. our waiter was everywhere but checking our table chit chatting with the coworkers and even on his phone showing the new manager his phone laughing and giggling. whatev im waving my hands trying to get his attention, finally got it. i simply said &quot;i was trying to get your attention&quot; in a nice joking way, the waiter dylan with an attitude said &quot; you don't have to be rude&quot; oh snap really? shit went from 0-1000 let me tell i was rude afterwards. so i spoke with the manager yeah useless. new manager, all need training on customer service. all bad. this was my go to place on tuesday night but sadly service at this bww is getting bad. even the couple next to us had the same problem where the waiter called her rude. no bueno sad. although the bartender guy don't know his name he's badass i like him. so i give 2 starts because i'm nice.... another thing they didn't announce last call for alcohol nor did waiter dylan notified us about last call
buffalo wild wings was definitely needed by the chino hills area, which was recently infused with a few other spots the region needed. &nbsp;it is a pretty good place to watch sports. &nbsp;each time i've gone, a sporting contest of some kind has been the main draw. &nbsp;though it happily parallels my occasional-to-frequent lust for wings. &nbsp;these are not the best wings. &nbsp;they do not approach the &quot;savage wings&quot; at russian river brewing in santa rosa, ca. &nbsp;but can i just cruise up to santa rosa of a tuesday evening, nibble and sweat happily away while drinking a pliny the younger? no! &nbsp;so i meander over the hill and settle in at the bar.the bar staff is great, and as far as i can tell so is the management. &nbsp;i've never sat at a table for wait service.they got rid of sierra nevada. that irked. &nbsp;though it was fun as, over a period of weeks, four or five different people apologized to me for that. &nbsp;and it made my trips that much cheaper, as none of their premium beers is worth the extra $ to me now. &nbsp;it is officially a no croaker zone to a hop junky (where sn pale ale is an analogical methadone). &nbsp;the wings:they are on the smallish side. &nbsp;but the sauces are quite good. &nbsp;better than wing nuts in ontario. &nbsp;their hottest, the blazin', is probably too much for any but the most eager fire eaters. &nbsp;it is the real deal. &nbsp;it builds a real nice, at times sharp, burn in the mouth and for me activates the tear ducts. &nbsp;the wild, 2nd hottest, is a fair amount cooler but still a good kick.many of the multiple other varieties are also worth a shot.the boneless wings are basically breaded chicken nuggets. &nbsp;i often opt for them instead. &nbsp;it seems like more bang for the buck, given the wee nature of the boneded ones.there are no great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink specials, but most appetizers are half off. &nbsp;the chili cheese fries got bigger and better recently, i think. &nbsp;i remember them being meager and depressing the first time i ordered.and on tuesdays, wings are 45 cents each, packs of 5. &nbsp;thursdays, boneless ones are 60 cents each. &nbsp;it is not a classy joint. &nbsp;lots of plastic and cardboard is involved with eating here. &nbsp;and there is lots of yellow and logos everywhere. &nbsp;but it is clean and <span class="highlighted">happy</span>.i'm feeling loquacious and like i could just keep finding little snippets of things to say so i'm going to stop now.update (12.9.2009): &nbsp;pyramid snow cap, a pretty good winter warmer (7%), is on tap.
this the second buffalo wild wings i have been to and i was not too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the service. the line was about and <span class="highlighted">hour</span> long, but then again it was 50 cent wing night. then once we get in and sit down it got slightly better. &nbsp; &nbsp;the waitress came by took our order but had a hard time hearing us. i know it was loud in there but we tried to speak up just short of yelling. anyway the order came in it was correct. yet for some weird reason i know it was cheap wing night but it seemed they gave us the smallest wings they had. each of us almost polished off 20+ plus wings to get full. on top of that we had like 4 different waiters. anyway given the size of the wings they are still delicious hence why i still gave it 3 stars. i have been to the one in rancho cucamonga its way better. oh fyi if you do the blazing challenge eat 12 of their hottest wings in 6 minutes be forewarned. you will get wings swimming in the sauce and wings the size of regular drumsticks it's a little clever ploy to have you not finish it.

great new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. m-f 3pm until 7pm. $3 local brew pints and half off appetizers #yum
i love this place! during the week it's a great place to grab a drink and karaoke. on the weekends it's a bar and tiny club which is also fun! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks are really reasonably priced. my friends &amp; i always get the best service. i really enjoy coming here!
&quot;there's no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because every <span class="highlighted">hour</span> is <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; is what the waitress told me. my friends i come here every now and then to celebrate because the drink prices arn't that bad and also because they show all the sports games. this place is fairly large and can accommodate a lot of people. they also have a larger patio with heat lamps and cool flames coming out the tables. all in all, not too shabby on the food. i particularly like their mac and cheese burgers and their lettuce wraps. another plus for all the men out there, the waitresses have &nbsp;this irish/catholic school girl outfit as their uniform. i would say some of their uniforms are borderline hooter's status.
food is pretty good and there is a lot of different beers to try. the service is very good. every one is very nice. price are good even when it's not a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;there are lots of tvs to watch the different games. &nbsp;i would recommend this place to everyone
three and half stars and that's because they've improved somewhat! first time here it was so loud (still really early maybe 6-7?) so definitely not a place for conversations. food wasn't that good. came back a few months later for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks which weren't priced too bad. came last night and it was a lot better. our waitress was vanessa who was really sweet and wasn't obscenely dressed or tremendously rude like i've experienced in the past. she checked back with us as well as the other tables around us a lot. it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so appetizers were 25% off, beer was $3 for 16 oz and $5 for $22, and its pretty good quality (i got hangar 24 betty ipa which was pretty good). i ordered the ultimate nachos which were $1 originally but we're 25% off. they were huge and decked out in bens cheese guac and sour cream. my only complaint is they were a little cold like they'd been sitting there. my boyfriend got the mac and cheese burger. he's really picky about mac and cheese (none of that kraft stuff for him) and he said it was pretty good. overall, it's a place i'd come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and that's about it
this place is really good for what it is. if you come here to have a nice sit down meal then you will be very disappointed.the drinks here are very good and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are great! $3 pints for me and i'm set. i came here with a group of people and some of them weren't drinking. we ordered almost all of the appetizers on the menu and those in our group complained about how the food didn't taste very good. this is a great example of how you should just take this place for what it is. the food is average bar food and, just like in most bars, the food doesn't taste that great but once you've been drinking it doesn't really matter as long as you can put something on your stomach. with that said, if that isn't what you want then don't come here. no, the food isn't that great, but it's a good place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.the service was really good, even though our waitress kind of stood in the distance staring at us for a while. apparently they turn into a club at 10 pm on fridays, but i didn't stay that long.overall this place has a good atmosphere and it's definitely somewhere you want to come with a group of people. otherwise you'll be drinking alone and eating food that's subpar, which is something you can do at home#19/100
drinks are super cheap. and it's a great concept. i come here just for all the tvs and cheap beer. do not ever expect great service here. owners are trying to do more with less to &nbsp;stay rich. everything takes forever every time. &nbsp;sounds weird that i'm saying all this but it's always a friends choice to come here not mine and nothing ever changes. if you can find <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> somewhere else i do, but if you get dragged here by majority vote then just be patient and you will have a good time. not to mention it always smells stale in here like the nightly duties are not being done in their entirety.
i stopped by here while on a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>/pub craw/we just want apps and drinks/whatever you want to call it.the place was packed on a sunday afternoon with people watching football. the food was good (good greasy bar food), and i was thrilled at the beer selection.plenty of beers other than the usual main stream ones, you can easily find one or two you probably haven't tried yet.
service super friendly, beautiful interior, great beer, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices excellent. ordered chicken marsala, not expecting amazing (this is an&quot;irish&quot; bar after all) and it was actually tasty. the bread that accompanied the dish was delicious... could have eaten a whole plate of that.
i love dillon's. all the beer on tap is $3/5 depending on the size and the food is inexpensive+tasty. some orders are also discounted during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the bartenders are friendly too. i highly recommend dillon's.*as of 10/1/14 the beers prices have been increased by a dollar for each size. now $4/16oz and $6/22oz.
this is the first pub i went to in chino hills. maybe, it's the only pub in the suburbs here? we got their fried avocados, mac and cheese sliders, and nachos. they were all really meh. there wasn't anything special about the fried avocados. the mac and cheese sliders seemed pretentious, something just didn't taste right in my opinion. i can't pinpoint it. so, their food was underpar. however, they got good prices for beer. my friends played pool here and that was fun to watch. otherwise, i'd prefer some other places nearby for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> instead.
i like it. usually head over to watch football (or now) hockey. &nbsp;its nice, has a nice feel, good it good and they have a lot of tvs. &nbsp;i go on sunday mornings or in the evening... a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;food is good, the people/servicers are nice. &nbsp;over all i plan to return throughout hockey and football seasons. &nbsp;nice neighborhood place for me. &nbsp;cheers!
beer selection is jusy so-so and service is getting worse. some good bartenders have left, too bad the ones who left were very good with the patrons. food is still underwhelming even with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. very bad management. compare the management here wit yardhouse aound the block and see the difference. place has also gotten raunchier and is not safe on friday and saturday nights. the crowd is no longer local.
came here for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the place was pretty empty. there were a few people at the bar but the majority of tables were empty. we were seated on the upper level kind of isolated. we had two different servers one changed in the middle of our shift. they were pretty friendly. the thing about this place is the price. they are a little pricey for the appetizer menu. there were some items that were more than an entree, which made no sense to me. the food was good. the mac and cheese burger was different but not bad. i really did enjoy the calamari. i would probably come here again. the one thing that did bother me was there was a fly that kept buzzing around it. i'm thinking it might be due to the farmers market but that was a little disturbing. we did get a free drink with our yelp check-in but was questioned about what it was and i had to give the manager my phone to verify it.
i tend to not review places based on one sole review, but because i was particularly curious about why this place received such bad reviews i wanted to express my own satisfaction on my first visit there earlier this evening.first, the decor was very nice (love the flame lit tables outside); second, the wait staff (including quite sexy kilt-clad waitresses) were both friendly and attentive; third, the food was very good, no complaints (in our party, we tried the lettuce wraps, fish &amp; chips, avocado fries, and the ahi salad); and lastly, the drinks were very refreshing (the celtic margaritas exhibited an interesting use of jameson).overall, it was a cool place with a fairly lively atmosphere (for a weekday evening). &nbsp;i am witholding a star only because there really isn't <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing on drinks and appetizers. &nbsp;however, i shall return to try the celtic (and see the kilts) a few more times.
i've been here quite a few times, great sports bar feel. definitely outdoes any sports bar franchises (yard house, buffalo wild wings, etc.), flat screens flood the walls, great music makes the vibe just that much better. i don't understand the super low reviews! probably guys hating that the hot waitresses don't pay any mind to them. the food is typical bar food, only better. definitely a great place for dinner with friends, watching the fights/games, and even a first date (breaks the ice with the unanimous rooting for the lake show, dodgers, etc.). i highly recommend this place, great food, great prices on drinks, and a great ambiance. obviously very extensively planned, every bit of the construction is impressive to even an interior design major like myself. me and my girlfriends always go there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after a long day at work.
came here for a friend's birthday recently, and had mixed feelings about this place after reading some reviews.i sat down at the bar with my boyfriend as we joined our friend's group, and never got asked what we would like to drink, or even got offered a menu. the guy that was walking around inside seemed to pay attention to the other patrons more than us, and there wasn't even that many people there. when another waitress finally came around, we ordered the nachos and french fries, and enjoyed our beers. i don't know if it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or not, but $3 for a blue moon? i was <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. the nachos were pretty good, they hella caked on the cheese, which i highly appreciated and made it ooey and gooey when it came out. the plethora of colored chips kept it festive, as promised. i do wish they put more jalepenos on it, but not a lot of people can eat them, so i understood why. the fries were great. i'm p icky about what type of fry i eat, so they were perfectly golden brown, and crispy. i love french fries when they're a tad mushy, so there were two varieties, so fist pump for that! the downside? the waitress said it would be seasoned? there wasn't even a lick of salt on our fries, so i wasn't too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about that.aside from that, the service was mediocre. our waitress never really checked up on us, and we never saw the waiter again. one of my girl friend's that was sitting next to me, paid $20 for her blue moon (which costed $3), and never got her change back, until we had to ask someone else 20 minutes into waiting. will i be back? probably not, but it was a good experience for our friend's birthday shindig. the beer prices on tap were excellent though, so if i do come back... it would be for that pure reason - otherwise i'm sticking with yardhouse across the street.
one year later and dillon's goes from 5 stars to 1. i went there last night with my friend for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. here is how it all went down....walked in... no one at the front, no host and no other guests. waited 5 minutes before someone finally came and said, can i help you? well duh! i would like to be seated!!i decided to sit in the bar area to watch the baseball game. over towards the bar, there were three guys, one you could tell was completely intoxicated. he tried to say something to me but his speech was so slurred, i couldn't understand what he was saying. the staff, in general, are really cool! the waitress and bartender were super nice! the manager, can't say much for him but i'll get to that...more obnoxious guys come to join the current group of drunk fools. my friend and i decide to move to the other side of the bar because they were being so loud and obnoxious. at one point, i wondered if we were on that show, &quot;restaurant stakeout&quot; because the way those guys were acting was way beyond belief. they were acting like idiots, dancing, videotaping each other, drinking and talking about how drunk they wanted to get. the worst part, none of the staff did anything to quite them down. all the other guest kept looking at them like, wtf! i made a few comments to the bartender but still... nothing. apparently, one guy (the really intoxicated one) had been in there since 11am drinking. i got there around 5:30...what does that tell you? he was so belligerent, that his friends finally made him sit down and drink water. sure enough, they had to escort him to the restroom because he tossed his cookies. on the way to the restroom, one of the other drunk idiots stops by and said to us, &quot;do you want to see his d..k?&quot; i was like wtf!!!! i've had it!!! i go to the front, ask for the manager. the host says, &quot;oh he's in the back.&quot; so i tell her, i need to speak to him now. i tell him what happened and he says, &quot;sorry. i'll ask them to leave.&quot; as he's walking off he says, &quot;peace out&quot;...peace out??? wtf! what kind of rude jerk did they hire as a &quot;manager&quot;!!!! so he heads to the restroom, says something to the drunk fools. did they leave, no! i was so disgusted by the whole event that we didn't even get to finish our meal and we left....should have not paid for the bill but we did. first of all, he's not a manager if he's sitting in the back doing absolutely nothing! he doesn't think about the other customers that are there trying to enjoy themselves. but then he probably didn't care because those guys were more than likely his friends. usually is the case... and what the heck was up with the jeans and t-shirt? everyone else is in uniform so i would have never guessed that he was a &quot;manager&quot;. &nbsp;i feel bad for the few people that work there because they are nice...but never again will i step foot in this place!!!
after months of <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> at yard house and ra. after months of talking obvious coming to dillon's, we actually did. i don't know what we were waiting for, but now we can't wait to come back!i arrived later than the rest of my group and everyone was getting up and moving when i got there. i thought they were all getting up and leaving because i was so late, but i digress. they were being moved because the hostess had accidentally sat us in a reserved section. the manager came per and apologized profusely as she moved us to our new table and bought us a round and two desserts to thank us for moving. honestly, it wasn't that big of a deal because we're all pretty easy going, but its the thought that counts and she definitely took care of us. the hostess came over and apologized as well. we definitely appreciate the attention to service we got.now, on to the food. i don't know what was consumed before i got there, but i know what the yelp community told me to order (and i did).-fried avocado: so good we ordered two! it comes out resembling fried zucchini and tastes so much better! imagine creamy, delicious avocado enveloped in a crispy blanket. the crunchy and the smooth were perfect together. on the side is a lemon mayo and chili aioli and both were good. while they're great on their own, i liked the combo of them mixed together (as per our servers suggestion). i will absolutely be ordering these again and again!-smoked artichoke: the artichoke was delicious! it was smokey and tasty. i liken it to the smoked artichoke at lucille's, minus the balsamic. it was good, i'll be ordering it again.-mac n cheese burger sliders: wow! these little guys were just amazing! the sliders themselves came out on a deliciously chewy bun, similar to a king's hawaiian roll. the burger patty was juicy and tender. the mac n cheese on top was cheesy and delicious, and held together nicely was we ate the burger. everything was perfect here, i didn't need to add anything. the fries that came with it were great too.-chicken quesadilla: the quesadilla was good, but came at an unfortunate point in our appetizer frenzy. tis was one of the lat things we ordered and we were probably a little too excited. don't get me wrong, it was good but we had eaten our fill. the portion size was generous and daunting. i'm embarrassed to say we only ate two pieces of the quesadilla as an entire table because no one was hungry anymore. it was good, i'd consider ordering it again but i think it's clear what my favorites were!the dessert the manager gave us was the bread pudding. she spoke so highly of it that we had to get it, and boy was she rightl the bread pudding was toasty warm when it came out. it was ooey-gooey and delicious. the custard was sweet and delicious. the ice cream on top was a nice pairing, the warm and cold worked well together. the whiskey sauce on top was the figurative icing on the cake. overall, this desert was delicious and not to be missed.i think it's safe to say that we'll be back!
my first visit here happen to be on dodgers opening day 2015 so i knew it was gonna be crowded however i dont exaggerate &nbsp;the fact how me and my party had to wait over an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to be serviced at all. we even in this <span class="highlighted">hour</span> had to switch locations and find new seats in order to maybe be served. when i finally was able to wave down a waitress who rolled her eyes in disbelief that she had to serve more people. we gave her both our food and drink order and well that was almost a whole <span class="highlighted">hour</span> until my girlfriends soda and my beer came which both ended up being either warm or completely watered down from it sitting with no one bringing it to us.so literally once our drinks came an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> later our food came which was the reason for the 2 stars because it was delicious i ordered the guinness stew and my gf ordered the bbq burger with onion rings. what made me most annoyed of all was the fact how i was able to see our waitress pay attention to parties that shes bringing 4 plus beers to their table multiple times before even looking in our direction.i personally very rarely ever say anything to a waitress about their service to their face but i needed to say something in this event. i explained to her how she seemed to be very slow and she said sorry but it was busy and their understaffed, but i flat out told her that i clearly saw her giving service to other tables by bringing multiple rounds of beer before my 1 beer even showed up to the table and she after had no comment no apology and i even told her that i was not gonna pay for the soda that she tried charging me 3 dollars for which was completely watered down and no refill was provided to us. so i was fine paying for a few of the items but i did not want to give this place another chance for that horrible service and purposeful ignoring. it sounds terrible but i gave her a quarter for a tip for our almost 30 dollar bill just so she understood that you need to provide a decent service to receive a tip from a customer. 2nd visit:i have a long review because i wanted to mention my revisit which was a normal friday night which honestly i give a 4 star to this visit. i unfortunately forgot the name of our waitress ( she has a light blue strip in her hair) she was great and extremely attentive to us along with others she was serving. overall this experience made my extremely <span class="highlighted">happy</span> and more hopeful for this place knowing theres plenty of good service here its just some individuals slip through the cracks and have terrible service. i will be back soon though.
papachinos-grill-and-greens-chino
omg. this fish stew !!! amazing !! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu .. friendly staff .. the fact that this place is so close to work makes it much more convenient.
ceviche salad. fresh foods, nice for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or lunch.
i love this place. super clean. friendly staff. amazing food. quality service. there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, can't be beat. and there pumpkin roll is to die for.
went for lunch on a saturday and the service was great. they were friendly, efficient, and helpful. i recommend the chicken tacos and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals. i would definitely go back!
we came on a saturday for lunch. it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so $2 off appetizers! &nbsp;there is a cute outdoor area with tiki hut covering. it doesn't quite match the food they serve. this must of been some other food place before. we ordered the ceviche and ahi tuna. the choices see to be healthier options. it took about 15 min to get the food. totally worth it! &nbsp;food was delicious and healthy!the story with this place is that there was this man who had heart problems and could not find a restaurant that had food that he can eat. so he made one! &nbsp;thanks.
four stars for the combination of good food, &nbsp;with reasonable portions, &nbsp;at cheap prices. i always get the fish and chips, &nbsp;and it is made perfectly! the batter is light and crispy. i am a fan of quick service restaurants, you can get in and out at your own pace. you can get your own refills, and sauces, instead of waiting on someone. you don't need to tip as much either. they have amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, with $1.50 domestic draft beer and &nbsp;$3.00 imports. the only reason why they lose a star is because they have the worst mac n' cheese i've ever eaten. but everything else is amazing!
this restaurant is great! &nbsp;i love the fish and chips. &nbsp;the workers are all so nice and their patio is wonderful. &nbsp;they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 2 to 6 with $1.25 beers. you can't beat the prices and the atmosphere. &nbsp;nothing over $10 on the menu.
this place is a hidden gem in chino! &nbsp;just moved into area and was looking for an outside patio to have a beer with wife and be able to bring our dog. &nbsp;outside patio/ checkcool breeze under palapa cover/ checklots of beer choices and pitchers / check checkfree chips with lots of salsas to try ... yepwhat we have found after coming back a few times is they have great healthy food -- kind of a mix of typical mexican with lots of different fish choices. &nbsp;the shrimp tacos and ceviche are really fresh and tasty with really fair prices .... <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $10 beer pitchers + other deals and the vibe of the entire place has been really relaxing with sports tvs outside. &nbsp; stop by -- you won't be disappointed. highly recommend this place --
great food. great service. you can't really beat 2 tacos and a pint of domestic beer for $5 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. your choice of protein and only add $1.50 more to upgrade to an imported beer. i've gone here a few times with my boyfriend and it's hard not to get the deal, though they have a ton of delicious choices and daily specials. the atmosphere is filled with music, either from a live band or a dj, which makes eating there even more of an experience. oh! how could i forget... bottomless chips and a salsa! mmmm!
didnt honor ad pricesthis rating is strictly regarding the customer service i received on one visit. i often frequent this restaurant the food is great and healthy. specifically patronized during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because of the prices posted on the web. &nbsp;i found i was being chared a higher price than what the web advertised. the bartender told me the web was wrong they changed the prices. after showing her the ad on their site from the phone i asked for a credit on the difference. she said no. i ordered drinks for a couple of hous and asked three times, &quot;for the sake of great customer service&quot; will you honor the price. she said no. then she went to the back office, changed the pricr on the web and charged me full price. i asked the waitress if the owner was in and she told me i had been talking to the owner.....the bartender was the owner.astounding that the customer experience wasnt more important to her than the, at most, 8 dollar ad differnce. so very disappointed.
grilled steak...lemon-butter salmon...teriyaki chicken skewers...shrimp wraps...jumbo scallop pasta....papachino's offers plenty of tasty options as you can see. and guess what.. they're made fresh and healthy!! it's a great way to eat right for good prices. you probably think i'm joking right.. a health concerned yelper?! well yeah! haha. i gotta balance out all the bad food i've been eating over the years. so it's always a nice change to find a place close to home that can provide good quality eatery =)everything is equally delicious and you get a variety of side choices like brown rice, pasta salads, fruits, and veggies. c'mon, do yourself a favor and try it already!note: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> daily 3-7p. enjoy a few beers and tacos in the spacious patio outside!
i had never heard of this place before until today when i had some business in the area. my friend suggested we check this place out because the menu looked very interesting and they offer a lighter side and healthy food for those that are health conscience and counting calories. i ordered the seared ahi with the grilled vegetables and brown rice. the fish and the grilled vegetables were tasty, the brown rice could've been a bit better. the prices are very reasonable so i couldn't really complain.they have a very well-stocked salsa bar with complementary chips, which is a great feature. the staff here seems very friendly and helpful as well, there was an overall very positive vibe and also laid-back atmosphere. if your local you probably already know about their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that goes from 3 to 6 pmi would definitely return to have a light healthy meal here when in the area.
went here after sunday church. it was about 12 in the afternoon and it seemed pretty slow and it was a bit annoying trying to order because there menu is on the wall in line where you go to give your order. it would be different if it was a small menu but they had a lot of options for food so it made it annoying trying to order for a group of 10 people.i ended up ordering their shrimp tacos which came in soft taco shells. it seemed that with the lack of a big crowd it shouldn't take a long time for our food to come out. we waited about 25 minutes then finally one of the food items came but overall we had to wait over 30 minutes to get all our food.my shrimp tacos were the only reason why i give it even 2 stars because the shrimp had a good taste to it, but the problem is they place so much sauce on the taco that after eating 1 the rest are soggy and the texture makes it not enjoyable. it made me annoyed and when the waiter who gave us our food came by to ask how it was my group told him honestly that it didn't taste good at all. instead of saying sorry or anything similar he just said, &quot;ohh&quot; which actually made me and my group laugh it seemed like they always get people saying the food is always good when it's not.i hear people tell me how great it is but i feel part of the reason is because they do have some of the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials during the weekday which i can see getting a lot of people to come. besides that i don't think its very special of a place. if i have a friend who wants to try it ill give it another chance but as of right now it wouldn't be a top choice of food locations in chino. &nbsp;again the small high lights of why i even gave this place 2 stars is because the shrimp is cooked well and because they have a full bar which is a nice addition anywhere.however,i would recommend wahoo's up the same street toward chino hills much better quality.
red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino
we used to go to here at least three times a month but since they tried to get fancy with the plates and silver fry holder we have gone once in three months. &nbsp;the prices went up because of the plates and new fancy menu. &nbsp;get rid of all that and lower the prices again. their burgers are great. &nbsp;i love the servers. &nbsp;they got rid of all my favorite managers and now train employees. &nbsp;we still love the burgers and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;service is good and the beer is cold and cheap during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
came here for late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.had the burning love burger $9.49. burger was pretty good with the friend jalapenos. also substituted the bottomless fries for bottomless garlic fries. love how the garlic fries can be bottomless too.got disappointed because they used to put bits of garlic chunks in the garlic fries, but they don't do that anymore. they just put garlic sauce on it= fail.did not like how the waitress was slow and when we asked her about how much drinks costs on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, she didn't really know.
food was great. service was great...and they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> b]i have been going to this joint just recently. and i missed out on alot of good stuff. idk if its just me or what, but they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. and they have really good deals! their whiskey burgers are really tasty and i enjoy their bottomless fries! id come to this place over and over again just for their fries. i love their freckled lemonade! but i wish they had actual frozen straberries than the ones that have been thawed already. good thing they were bottomless!! this place has a good location just on the spectrum. and the place looks like all the other red robins. &nbsp;i agree with other reviewers, that tv should be bigger, since their place looks a bit more in the sporty side. overall...excellent restaurant :]
went here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and dinner with my family (as well as another location). all the trips have been really good and i have no complaints. i've always watned to try the little crispy onions (becasue they look so darn good)but i haven't ordered a burger....yet. they have good portions and good prices. all the food i have recived has looked and tasted good, though sometimes i'm just not a fan of the flavor. so when i say tasted good i mean it tastes just like they tell you it will and there are no burnt portions, or stale food involved. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are really good too if you can stop in on a weekday.
great burgers. great drinks. love there unlimited fries they give you when you order a burger. service is always usually good. been coming here for awhile now. only down side is they don't really have an appealing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
i love their burgers here! i think they have the best of all the similar type places ( chillies, fridays, etc). also never ending fries!! and their fries are great too. but the negatives... i didn't realize it before but this is a popular place for families and kids. lots of kids. last time i came around dinner time there were kids everywhere running around, and screaming, and crying, and servers running to clean up messes. i don't have kids so i guess i will be less bothered by it when my time comes. but for now i would only come for a late dinner, like 8pm or later. also, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals are kinda weak, as was the margarita i ordered. but i will be back! for the burgers and fries. yum : )
chilis-chino-hills
5 stars for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!i'm not normally a fan of their food. however, they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!i'm not a big fan of alcohol, but their original blended margaritas is pretty darn good! best part is, they gladly provide unlimited free chips and salsa!we love it because we only spend about $5 each after tax &amp; tip. so, it's a great place hang out and chit chat!
this is not my usual chili's but came here because we were really hungry. we sat in the bar area since we believe it's fast service and also because it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> of the have good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. our server was great he was fast, attentive and very friendly. we ordered two appetizers and our entr&eacute;es and my husband order his two usual draft beers. our food came out pretty fast and served with good amount of portions. we enjoyed our meal, the ambience was kind of noisy but its a bar, it's to be expected. it was an enjoyable experience for dinner.
i love chili's <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. &nbsp;my family will definitely back for many more nfl monday night football. &nbsp;my kids were in love w the tablet. mom and dad actually not so busy to attend the kids needs. &nbsp;drinks were great. &nbsp;foods are ok. &nbsp;too salty w the fajitas though.
came here today for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. pretty good service. they were not busy at all. we started off with some nachos which were really good. the sparkling &nbsp;pomegranate margarita was super good! i ordered the new philly cheese steak sandwich. it was awesome!! overall it was a great visit today!
you know, your typical chili's. we came here late on sunday night, and i got to judge their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>:$1 off margaritas, draft beers, 1-liquor drinks. $.50 buffalo drummettes (i would recommend these!)$3 skillet queso (probably only good if shared - too much cheesy meaty gooeyness for myself alone)overall, decent. the bartender made a weird shot that looked like weird stuff you'd probably see in an anatomy lab. they seem like chill fun people.
my family and i have &nbsp;been going to this chilis for 2-3 years now. &nbsp;we typically go in on sundays for their amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals all day. their staff is very friendly and always takes time to chat with all 4 of us. &nbsp;food is great, service too. &nbsp;new remodel makes perfect ambiance for sports lovers. new mexican menu is my new favorite. &nbsp;margarita bowl and chipotle bowls rock!we never sit in dining area because we enjoy the bar atmosphere and multiple televisions. &nbsp;alex, annie and all the other sunday staff are amazing! &nbsp;we will continue to come in here as long as the service and food remain the same :)
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was very disappointed, drink specials were pretty weak. domestic beers were about $4.50, margaritas were about $5, and well drinks were $3.75. &nbsp;we got the 2 for $20, appetizers were very limited, everything fried, ended up getting the chips, corn guacamole and salsa, the most of the chips were crumbled and rendered useless for scooping guacamole. if you are going to go for the $2 for 20 get the chicken crispers, they are delicious and come with corn on the cob and fries. my gf got the chicken fajitas and they were laughable, the chicken looked like it was microwaveable, so sadly to say &nbsp;we shared my food, serves her right for ordering mexican food at chili's.
one of my favourite places to eat around home, ever -- i come here like all the time. and what's even better now is the fact that i'm 21 now! yay! margaritas and beers are half off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!so, it's usually busy around the evening <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, of course. but all of my services here have been great: friendly servers and they're very personable.food: baby back ribs -- they're delicious!! you can't go wrong with them! get a rack! mix a rack! they're great!! once in a while, a steak is great as well -- i like mine rare, and chili's definitely cooks it a lot better than some other places. dessert is always awesome as well, like ice cream desserts or something with chocolate mousse.what i also like is that the to-go service doesn't take too long, and the cashiers are pretty great with that too. it's also a pretty clean place for a franchise restaurant, and it's always fun to go in large groups.
i've been to several chili's before, i know what to expect. we arrive at 3pm and the door is opened by a lovely host ready to greet and sit us down. she was great. she tells us if a booth is okay and who our server will be. couldn't have gotten a better host than her. server was o'kay, nothing great. the place was dead and we couldn't even find her to refill our waters for about 7 minutes. she should be walking like a headless chicken around the area seeing if drinks need to be refilled or if someone is trying to tract her down. i order unlimited soup and salad. misses orders chicken enchiladas. orders are taken and she disappears for about 20 minutes. like a headless chicken i was expecting her to come back because my combo comes with chips and salsa but she never did and i wanted to munch on something before the meal comes out. i've never had their soups before but they were good. after the first bowl though they started to be a bit heavy for me. just too much. they're hearty though! misses entree looked not so great. the white sauce they put on top of the enchiladas looked clumpy and microwaved. i really can't tell if it was or not but the consistency of the sauce seemed really off. i would give this place a two star but do feel a bit bad. the host was awesome and well, who am i to be leaving two stars anyways. maybe i just went at a bad timing. if im in the area again maybe i'll go back for just drinks and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. if i want dinner i'll go to the shops across the street and go to a restaurant more to my liking.
shoboo-kitchen-chino-hills
not impressed. sister took me during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and said their sushi was amazing. but i don't even remember whether the sushi was good or not because our server was what took all of my attention. she acted like we were doing her a disservice by being there and &quot;forgot&quot; to bring edamame until my sister kindly reminded her. maybe the sushi was good, i don't know, but the service was bad enough for me not to come back again.
no ayce. no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. no bigs!my husband and i love shoboo! when neither of us have the appetite to do ayce, this is our go-to sushi spot. they have awesome lunch specials, even on weekends! for $8.95, i can get my favorite crunchy roll (they make them just the way i like it!), spicy tuna roll or 3 pieces of sushi, (love the salmon!) miso soup and salad. for $2 more, instead of the crunchy roll, my husband upgrades to their specialty rolls, like the red blossom or rainbow roll, his favs. the fish is always fresh and the sushi has a good rice-to-fish ratio. we always leave super full, super <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, and super satisfied. the service has always been fast, efficient and friendly every time we've dined here or if i ordered to go. i still have yet to try their new &quot;create your own&quot; poke bowls and ramen. i had to deduct one star due to the following:- uncleanliness of the hallway leading up to the restroom. the sight of the dirty dishes make the place look dirty. - broken a/c during the hot summer days is unacceptable. the last couple of times we had lunch there, the a/c was not running.
they have a pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and saki bombs are ridiculously cheap. we usually buy a few and share with the sushi chefs. fun times! if you like sashimi salad, then you must try the spicy sashimi salad! this is a large salad with a lot of fresh sashimi and a ton of fresh lettuce. the dressing is to die for. i typically split this salad with my boyfriend and we are pretty full after we finish it. the salad itself is a little pricey but the portions are well worth the $10 or so.. i would also recommend trying the peppered tuna, jalapeno poppers, and a few of their specials rolls.
i'm going to agree with matt r. on this one. after being here twice i was surprised that this place had 4 stars with so many reviews. i can't see how it deserves more than 2 stars. first off my friends and i asked what the sign saying &quot;all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; was referring to. the waiter seemed like it was the first time he was asked this and said the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu consisted of 1 thing: buck 50 sake bombs. i asked if there was anything else, and the answer was no. the second strike was when we tried to order the yakidori, and the waiter told us they don't do that. by this point we were feeling misled, and were considering leaving. third strike was the miso soup. usually this comes after you order and before your food arrives. for some reason they brought it out halfway through our dinner. so they struck out, and the game is over. we aren't going back.
it was a lazy sunday and i was in need of a sushi fix. missing the clock for a few other sushi bookmarks, i found this place hidden inside chino hills with a &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day&quot; sign posted up for all to see... well the &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day&quot; is just a gimmick to pull you in, cause their prices are like any other average sushi establishment, and is actually bordering on expensive if you ask me. they did have some nice lunch special deals that we're available, but i was feeling balla' regardless... and went with their normal menu. i ordered the sashimi salad ($10.95)... the salad was okay - it was considerable in size and had a good amount of sashimi; it was dressed well and could have easily been share. however, my largest gripe was that the sashimi was cut into large cubes and hard to really enjoy. it was undoubtedly quite fresh for chino hills sushi, but the freshness wasn't well highlighted with how the fish was cut.would i be back? maybe for a big group? they seem to have a pretty extensive menu with lots of fusion rolls, which make for an easy crowd-pleaser.
my experience with shoboo kitchen was excellent. i came here with my friend for an early dinner. there was plenty of parking and the wait was non-existent. the restaurant was lightly decorated for the christmas holidays. there were plenty of seats, but all the tables were small. i think they'll have trouble compensating for a large party (8-10). the staff was very friendly. the chef was kind enough to give us <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on their drinks, for our first visit. they even made a small flower and butterfly, out of a radish, and presented it to my lady friend (yes it made me look bad...) but it was nice of them anyways. the food was delicious. they have a vast selection on their sushi rolls. the red blossom roll was my favorite though.
pretty standard sushi restaurant, but not one of my faves. i have a high standard when it comes to my sushi lol. i love sushi! if i could eat it everyday i would lol. this place is really small with a smaller sushi bar. they have your pretty standard rolls, nothing out of the ordinary. the staff, however, is a crazy bunch. they pride themselves on making sure you are having a good experience and go out of their way to make sure they greet you on your way in and out. one downer was that they don't have an all you can eat menu but they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices everyday because it's their 2 year anniversary. it's a good place to try out at least once.
this is our first 5 star rating.. so u know this place has to be good! we are extreme sushi connoisseurs so we know what we're talking about! some of the freshest and most high quality fish you'll find anywhere! the staff is extremely friendly especially the lady that you'll usually find in the front of house. the sushi chefs often come to the dining area to see how their guest are enjoying everything, a gesture always appreciated! this restaurant oozes with the staffs passion for food and everything from quality to presentation epitomizes the phrase &quot;attention to detail&quot;. long story short, if you want high quality food, a high quality dining experience at low expense(<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices all day) then this is the place to be! maria and ivan out! ^_^
their pricing is excellent for certain items. for example, if dining in, spicy tuna rolls only cost $3.50. add to that the fact that they are almost always running a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special, and it's just good times.while the fish isn't the best quality, the service is incredibly friendly, fast, and courteous. the owner works often, and he's always smiling and having a good time. i haven't tried too much of the cooked food, so i cannot really comment on that area.the sashimi/nigiri here is really hit or miss. i've had the blue fin here before, and i wasn't too impressed. usually, i'll stick with the salmon, yellowtail, and albacore. again, this isn't anything to write home about, but it's definitely not terrible quality either. the main reasons to come here would be that it's cheap, the alcohol is almost always on sale, and the staff is very friendly and courteous. if you're looking for amazing sushi quality, then this probably is not the place for you. also, i'm talking more about sashimi/nigiri than the rolls/cooked food.
&quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day&quot; was all it took to convince me to try this place out last sunday. its charming little sushi joint located inside sprout shopping strip mall on grand ave. next to see's candy and chick-fil-a. though the space looks rather small and crowded, we were able to score seats quickly after a few tables became available.i was surprised how afford-ably cheap their sushi and rolls were priced, including 30% off on all beer and cold sake. our server was very friendly, helpful and informed me that there sushi are competitively priced which is why they're able to market them as &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.&quot; we ordered the yellow tail sushi, poke salad and 24 piece sashimi combo which includes 2 spicy tuna hand rolls and spicy miso. the sashimi and yellow tail sushi were surprisingly good. nice plate presentation and portions were generous. surely not the best sushi i've tasted, but fresh and great value, especially the sashimi combo priced at $30. the spicy tuna hand rolls were packed with plenty of minced tuna, well seasoned and scrumptious. poke salad was another exceptional dish that we loved. the portions were huge as well and can probably feed 2-3 people. more on the spicier side as opposed to subtle, but was very flavorful, fresh and delicious. unfortunately, i found the spicy miso a bit too hot and spicy. i could hardly drink the spicy broth without coughing and choking. the only thing edible from the soup was the large piece of shrimp that accompanied it. unless you can tolerate the heat, i recommend getting the regular miso. along with large bottle of asahi and few sodas, we ordered a few more items but had them to go instead which includes - chicken cutlet entree, beef and chicken teriyaki combo. all were excellent and arrived warm. what was surprisingly nice was the bill which only came out to be around $80. great service, good food, cheap priced sushi and beer. how can you go wrong with that? i can't wait to come back soon.parking - plenty huge lot.
i'm fairly new in this town, explored so many different sushi places, and i must say &quot;shoboo kitchen deserves to hold its #1 rated japanese restaurant&quot; in the area.the service and food quality are the most important factors, and they pleased me in both. the owner never lost her smile and made us very welcome and comfortable. the food was pretty fresh and very yummy. &nbsp;if you are looking for light and sublime taste, i recommend sunshine roll. if you don't mind something little heavy, try italian roll. it was very flavorful and filling with lobster and scallop. &nbsp;their chef specials were unique and delish!as they advertise their price being at &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; all day, price is really decent. &nbsp;pretty cheap! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;portions? a couple of rolls filled me and my husband up, and my husband can eat! we even came home with leftover. &nbsp;the owner gave us direction on how to eat it the best at home. &nbsp;lol i think this place just became my favorite!! &nbsp;can't wait to try other menu. overall, just great!
clayton-brewhouse-and-eatery-san-dimas-3
clayton brewing is a-ok. the food was good, nothing too incredible. my party ordered the panini and soup combo, salmon tacos, the bbq pork sandwich, and the southwest egg rolls and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. the southwest egg rolls were good, reminded me of chili's, but were a little on the salty side. the bbq pork sandwich was also pretty good, i wish the pork was a little less dry and there was more bbq sauce.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was great too. in addition to the weekday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, they also have saturday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - i love saturday <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> (12-4)! they have a pretty good selection of craft beers for only $4 a pint! such a great deal! the service was very attentive. i was honestly a bit surprised that there weren't more people in the restaurant. we came at lunch time on a saturday and were the only ones in there. hopefully business picks up for them because it's a cool space, friendly service, and pretty good food. i'd go back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
wasn't that impressed with this place. went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, expected better prices. wings were still $1 a piece...good location and friendly atmosphere though.
first time here, lunch before x-m&aacute;s shopping. deschutes porter, very good! food was great, ate from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. will be back for the sunday brunch to see how they do their monte cristo. &nbsp;san dimas has needed a gastro pub like this!
parmesan truffle fries were amazing! my blue cheese bacon burger oozed of cheesy goodness! should have come along time ago cuz this place is great. friendly staff and great service! looks like the have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals &amp; discounts during sunday football. i will definitely be back!!!
pretty decent food and great brews!! service was chill as well as the atmosphere. hidden little gem for a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> when in the area! the garlic parmesan fries are amazing!! def worth checking out!! imma roll thru again for sure soon!!
clayton is mediocre at best. the food is nothing worth remembering, their beer is just ok, and their service is nothing to complain about. i've been to clayton several times and each time i hope that it will be better than my last experience, but sadly it never is. i've had their seared ahi tuna salad (12.95) which was warm and a bit fishy. the buffalo wings ($9.25) were pretty standard. the white truffle garlic fries ($7.95) were pretty good and unique. the texas pork tacos ($9.25) were overpriced and poorly prepared. you get was 4 small corn tortillas, maybe a spoonful of their bbq pork and a dash of coleslaw. the most disappointing part was the tortillas were not even warmed before serving. it seemed like they were straight out of the tortilla bag and onto the plate. for a dollar more, you can order the bbq pulled pork sandwich ($10.95) which comes with a generous portion of the pulled pork and your choice of fries or side salad. also these pork tacos are $4 for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or $1.50 per taco on tuesdays. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &amp; taco tuesday pricing is much more realistic for what you are served. clayton does have a decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (fri 3-6pm &amp; sat 12-4pm). if you are looking to meet up with a friend for a beer and to watch a game, then this might be a good stop for you. they have several options to choose from ranging from $4 - $7 and $1 on all beer &amp; wine.i most likely will not be coming here again. and if i do, it will be for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and a beer or two.
came here on a thursday (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day) and had a pleasant time. relatively little people there so the service was quick and personal. tried a sampler of four different clayton beers and they were delicious! cold and tasty! also had the pork fries, which are so good with a cold beer. definitely recommend this location!
came here on a saturday afternoon luckily at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and had a fantastic time.clatyon's is great.it's spacious, relaxed, and comfortable.i didn't feel like i was coming to a bar.beer selection is extensive--written on a mirror in the back.the food was surprisingly delicious.the menu.3 clayton blonde: $12. &nbsp;this was perfect, light refreshing, not the slightest bit bitter.1 yeti stout: $6. &nbsp;i didn't like this. &nbsp;it was heavy, sweet, not what i was looking for.mediterranean bruschetta: &nbsp;$6. &nbsp;absolutely delicious. &nbsp;it was perfect to go with the beer comprised of artichoke hearts, olives, tomatoes, and herbs. &nbsp;served with perfectly toasted crostini. &nbsp;a quite generous portion: perfect for 2. tinga de pollo quesadilla: $7. &nbsp;this was fantastic, a lot better than i thought it was going to be. &nbsp;the menu describes several complex flavors and i was astounded that i could taste the chipotle, smoked jalapeno, tender chicken. &nbsp;yum. &nbsp;even better, it was grilled.all this with tip came to $37.71i'll be coming back soon on a thursday when pints are on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing all day. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is normally m-f 3-6 &amp; saturday 12-4.this is a great place to come with a friend, a group, or even alone and relax have something good to drink and enjoy yourself.i only wish i had started coming here sooner.
great food...good prices...excellent beer! what else can you ask for? the staff here is friendly and helpful. the have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (even though we missed it by 30 minutes) i will most definitely be returning. relaxing atmosphere and would like to come back for a game day.
we came cuz of yelp and thank you! had the best experience. the beer selection is great a does the job. the pork fries are so amazing and are huge enough to share. paul is fantastic to come out and talk to us. personable and welcoming makes a perfect come back bar. <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> are perfect. a true hidden gem.
i think the best way to describe this place would be as a spacious restaurant, cafe, and bar all in one. meaning there's actually a section that's a bit more like a cafe, and a section that's a bit more like a restaurant. they have some really great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on beer, outlets for your laptop, and a small selection of craft brews. love that their coors and bud section is titled &quot;if you must.&quot;
came by the other day to try it out for the first time after work. the place it self looks great...nice and clean with plenty of room. the staff was super friendly and easy to talk too...so the only buzz kill was the lack of options to drink. i was thinking they would have more craft beers other than the same common beers. overall ...yes i would come back for a quick drink for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or lunch but if you're into drinking more rare drinks your gonna have to go somewhere &nbsp;else....
i believe this place is a little newer but after eating there this past wednesday and i was a little shocked how empty this place was. we went there just at the tail end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which has some decent drink and appetizer specials (good beer selection). we tried two kinds of wings and the pork fries to start. the wings are big and meaty with a solid buffalo sauce, orange sauce is worth a try too. one in our party prefers his wings a little more crispy he said. the pork fries i think are a must try, at least once, how often do you have fries with sriracha? we each had burgers for the main course, i went all american and the other tried the bleu bacon. it is a big hunk of a burger that is cooked pretty well done. it tasted good, nothing crazy and we both agreed that the buns were a little to much bread, i believe they were home made though.all in all we would definitely return for another <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, could be a great place to check out before montana's on a friday or saturday evening. another note was the our server was amazing, granted the place was dead. if you are in the area, give this place a try.
i'm kind of torn between giving it a 3 or 4 star rating - definitely in the middle of those two. however, i'll bump it up because they usually have some solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals here and are usually pretty good about recommending a beer for you. the staff is really friendly although it can be a little hard to flag them down sometimes. in my opinion, the food is okay. it's nothing special in my opinion since it's just solid barfare. the greasy truffle fries and burgers makes a good pairing for your beers. overall, it's a great place to meet with a large group of people! they will also split your checks if you tell them ahead of time even if your group is much larger than 6 people. parking in the evenings can be a pain, but if you circle around enough, you'll be able to find parking within 10 minutes. in the day time, the lot is pretty dead.
great place! i love the food. they have a unique menu and the prices are good. i love the lobster sandwich and the truffle fries. the restaurant is always clean, the restrooms are clean. the food is always fast and fresh. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> has really good prices too. i really like the flat bread pizzas too! i recommend clayton's
came here for dinner and arrived before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended. we were able to order 2 beers and 3 appetizers for $24. we ordered the salmon tacos (4 came on a plate with a plenty of salmon and a semi-spicy sauce), the 4-inch margarita pizza (complete with pesto), and the mediterranean bruschetta (marinated olives, artichokes, and peppers). all was tasty and would definitely bring me back to try their other entrees, burgers, sandwiches, and salads. the waitstaff was definitely gracious of our service.
went here last week with a friend for the first time, a little hard to find if you don't know where you are going; but it's in the shopping center in the corner. thankfully it wasn't busy when we went and it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;took a seat at the bar with the nice bartender girl! (she's super sweet!) and we went with the truffle fries, the flatbread which comes with a clayton beer, and the sliders. from everything i loved the flatbread he most. it was cheesy fattening and delicious and for the price you can't beat it &nbsp;as for the beers i loved the clayton ipa and the blonde if your going for something light and refreshing then try the blonde. idk but the aftertaste was bomb hahaha. i would much rather come to this spot to grab a drink than go to yard house or something, it's more chill and it's cheaper and they have everything you would want to drink.
i came here to meet with some girlfriends for dinner :) its so empty! but don't let that fool you... the food is quite delicious!!we came on taco tuesday so the tacos were priced at $1.70 per taco. they offer a chicken, a salmon, and a pork taco. forget about the pork and just get the chicken and the salmon! the flavor on the chicken was amazing! very pleasantly surprised as i am usually a pork person~ the downside is that the tacos are small so i needed 5 of them to really fill me up! (as you may already know if you read my posts i'm not one to eat a whole lot either!)the garlic fries were also quite tasty and crisp! it was also <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so wines were $4 :) i got the riesling (my fav!) but it was a bit strong~last but not least, our server was so sweet! loved her! 5/5 overall.
this is place is pretty awesome! it's much more spacious than a typical cafe since it doubles as a restaurant and a bar! atmosphere- very chill, spacious laid back, cafe-esque. there are tvs and music playing but was quiet enough where i went to study for my business law final.service- excellent! our waitress was on top of everything and answered any questions and made recommendations. food- it was pretty yummy! my bf got the burger which he said was very good. &amp; i got the soup, salad, half sandwich combo which too was delish! but next time i'm there i'm sure to try a burger and craft beers. oh &amp; as for drinks, try the spanish latte it was amazing!price- typical cafe prices close to $10 a meal. i just missed <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but i will sure try to come back at that time. all in all, clayton's is definitely worth trying.
i don't know how this place isn't packed?! i have been here numerous times at different times&amp; days, and it is a ghost town! the food is great, i can't seem to branch off from the pulled pork sandwich with side salad (the vinaigrette is yummy!) it is just that good, &amp; &nbsp;we always have to get truffle fries for the table to share. my husband always enjoys the different burgers he orders. the only downside to this restaurant is how slow it takes for your food to come out. it's empty, and still takes quite a while... &amp;&amp; the beer is pretty good too! bottom line, if you are in san dimas, and hungry, go try clayton's out, it is yummy!updated 10/6/14; still slow, but the food is still outstanding! &nbsp;i had their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> chicken tingas tacos the other day, and they were so yummy!!!! &amp; they are a rodeo sponsor- so that makes them even better for supporting the community, in my opinion!!
came here not knowing what to expect, didn't check it out on here until after food prepared perfectly, beer sampler was amazing, servers were on top of their game for sure, they have a bar, and tvs showing the games, and the chef seriously asked how the meal was all in all i will come back here for sure <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is mon-fri 4:00 pm-7:00pm and sat 12:00pm-4:00pm $4.00 pints and wine by the glass extremely <span class="highlighted">happy</span> wiyh this place.
this place is great. very chill vibe. spacious coffee house that also serves beer and has free wi-fi. what else do you need in life? oh, i suppose some pretty decent and reasonably priced food to munch on as well. the owner and the staff are all pleasant and social people that make you feel welcome and taken care of without hovering. i've had a couple different sandwiches, a couple different salads, and a couple different soups as well as the chorizo breakfast burrito which was simply awesome. all the food is good quality and not too pricey for what you are getting. great beer selection and the quality of coffee they brew is something to be noted. all around, i very much enjoy this place and come here to do a lot of writing. if you want a quiet place to peruse the internet or do homework and sip a beer, come here. support local business. oh, it looks like they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> mon-fri. probably leave the books at home during that time.
pretty average. i would say 2.5 but the servers and beer round up. &nbsp;the servers were very friendly, welcoming and attentive. but i think that's because it was pretty empty, two servers to manage about three other parties at the bar. i like the aspect of having all the beers on the wall in dry erase, hopefully meaning that they rotate their beers with new ones. the ambiance felt a little off though. the dining area was very open. i felt like the lights needed to be dimmed more and something else to make the place feel a bit more homey. it was just a bit incomplete. &nbsp;i came here for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and its a pretty diverse hh menu. i ordered the grilled salmon tacos ($4), garlic truffle parmesan fries ($6) and balsamic ahi tartare ($7) with one white rascal beer. the two salmon tacos were under seasoned and a bit bland. the fries were covered in this alfredo like sauce with grated parm cheese. i imagined a truffle oil instead of a heavy sauce that was very salty. the ahi tartare was disappointing too. it was essentially a thin layer of tuna and avocado on a large portion of pickled cole slaw, a ratio of about 1:3. i didn't know i was ordering a small salad. the servers were great but the food fell short. i'm sure this place is great though for its many beers. that's all i would come back for.
the restaurant is located in a shopping center on arrow highway. &nbsp;upon walking in, i noticed how bare the place looked or at least, that was the impression i got. &nbsp;our server was nice and helpful in helping us decide what to order. &nbsp;we ordered the beer flight, fries, buffalo wings, mac and cheese and skirt steak. &nbsp;the beer flight is on par with most other establishments that i've been to as far as pricing goes. &nbsp;the liked the fries because of the crispness and cheese sauce doesn't hurt either. &nbsp;they do give you a boat load of fries though. &nbsp;definitely should be shared, unless you are super hungry. &nbsp;i liked the mac and cheese because it was creamy with a truffle taste to it. &nbsp;i didn't get to try the buffalo wings, so i can't comment on that. &nbsp;the skirt steak was a big disappointment. &nbsp;the steak was pale in color and didn't taste like it was grilled on an open fire. &nbsp;it looked and tasted like it was grilled on the flattop and then a branding iron was used to add the grill marks on it. &nbsp;a normal skirt steak should not look like it was boiled in water. &nbsp;it should have real grill marks and charring. &nbsp;the chimichurri sauce wasn't bad and made the steak edible. &nbsp;i also requested the meat to be medium, but it came out well done. &nbsp;normally when you cook a skirt steak on the done side, it gets chewy. &nbsp;but the steak wasn't chewy so that leads me to think that it was definitely boiled. &nbsp;i don't know if i would come back if i was in the area. &nbsp;but if i wanted to take advantage of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and/or beers, then maybe. &nbsp;the only thing that sucks is that there aren't that many sit down restaurants in this area. &nbsp;so the choices are far and few in between.
this used to be a coffee place which is why it doesn't exactly feel like a bar or brewery. it feels like a little coffee place. but they have a few tvs, beer, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day. exterior: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=y_rk4vdmbvybuik6n31ouw#y_rk4vdmbvybuik6n31ouw">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>first time here was great. the roasted red pepper soup was awesome. the salmon tacos from the starter menu were good. red pepper soup: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=sx9xy5mxloow1idum-9eeq#sx9xy5mxloow1idum-9eeq">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>salmon tacos: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=nblsmm-kvwnlwmm7oudxxq#nblsmm-kvwnlwmm7oudxxq">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>second time wasn't as smooth. i asked for the californian burger and accidently got the cali chicken burger. just a misunderstanding but it took us a while to get it straight that i never wanted the chicken burger. after it was cleared up, she explained that they can't do a rare burger. or a medium rare burger because of health laws, blah blah. she said they would try but they are supposed to do medium. my heart sunk, but since i usually get medium when i ask for medium rare anyway i could do it. but it was more medium well. couldn't finish it. it was like a hockey puck. too bad. it seemed a shame to overcook and waste what looked like a nice thick burger. &nbsp;california burger: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=8qfgs2nzvexiwesv7vcbsg#8qfgs2nzvexiwesv7vcbsg">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>californian burger &nbsp;interior: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=6cq_pthfi5xghn_cu6jyzg#6cq_pthfi5xghn_cu6jyzg">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>but my side salad was good with all romaine and no crappy iceberg. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=hrtg2kanoguzhrzyltnbza#hrtg2kanoguzhrzyltnbza">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>i like to sit and enjoy their free wi-fi and a beer now and then, so i will still go back, just stay away from the burger unless you like them cooked into hockey pucks like my mother does. &nbsp;every couple of sunday's they have a blues band play with a couple of special bbq plates available.
the food is good here and although service is a bit slow, especially during lunch (although we've never seen it busy even during that time), we had no real complaints. &nbsp;then we came here with our kids. &nbsp;although they have a kids menu so they obviously do cater to children, they didn't have a cheese quesadilla on the kids menu so i asked if it was possible to make one for my kids. i asked for just a plain cheese quesadilla, and she clarified that i didn't need any toppings. &nbsp;it arrived as ordered but when i got the bill, they had charged us for a full price chicken quesadilla ($9) and when i asked about it, our waitress refused to budge and mentioned it wasn't her problem that we decided to omit all the chicken, toppings, avocado, etc that normally comes on their quesadilla. &nbsp;she also charged both my kids for full price adult drinks ($2.95 each), even though they put their drinks in small kids cups and there is not a chance they drink like adults (with refills, etc). &nbsp;so, $12 later for less food than a kids meal (priced there at $6.95 including the drink and side), we felt quite taken as they made out well on our bill! &nbsp;additionally, it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i although i'd already confirmed this to be the case, when our bill came i had to have half the items on the bill redone because she tried to charge us full price. &nbsp;we felt quite unsettled as we left and we will definitely be going elsewhere in the future.

the food and drinks here are good. they now have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is every day 3 to 6 pm and 9 pm to close
been to this location 3 times. the food is okay and constant. i wouldn't go back if we happen to be in the area. they should better their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu by offering more drinks and food. &nbsp;food was ok. grilled chicken was rubbery and dry. they offer margaritas and long island, limited draft beer. they need to have more variety. we ordered the 2 for 25 special. the place is a bit it dated and should revamp.
great spinach dip and buffalo &nbsp;wings. &nbsp;and gets even better during half off <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 3-6. servers seat us quickly and take our orders. &nbsp; like any restaurants; you need to know what to order.
staff here is amazing! never a bad experience. everyone is always so friendly and hard working. i never see anyone standing around talking. the environment is very quiet but pleasant. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great! i also love that the restaurant is open late. nothing around the area is open late. i hope this place stays here forever!
i like this applebees alot better than the one near the west covina mall, but the food is almost always the same quality... i just like the service here. they also have a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i really like that 2 for 20 special they used to have. idk if they still have it, but it was such a good deal.
great spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! my bff and i got full on a $12 dollar check! the bone in wings , onion rings and fried green beans are pretty good. their 2 for 20 deal is a great bargain delicious and filling too. hit or miss with the servers though. one server in particular is really cool unfortunately we forgot his name. super nice and very accommodating to us. &nbsp;another visit we had a server that barely came to check up on us. we had to keep asking someone else for refills. then another server came up to us and told us she was taking over since the other server left for the evening. wow. don't servers usually let the customers now that they're gone for the day and introduce the new server? hoping for the cool server at our next visit lol!
i've been here twice now and i can now put an average on my review. i would prefer to give it 3.5 stars but it will have to do.the first time i went, i was with a group of friends and we took a table in the bar section. it took us probably 10 minutes to flag down someone to order drinks and waited even longer to order food--mind you, the joint was not busy that evening. the food was good that night, i remember ordering the wonton tacos and they taste exactly like chinese chicken salad (one of my favorites!) and we ordered other appetizers such as a quesadilla which was only average.my second time i went, i sat at the actual bar with a friend and were able to order two beers at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and were served very quickly. don't be attracted to the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices though, it was only a $1 decrease in the beer from what i could see. the food was average once again. i ordered sliders and i barely tasted them--nothing special. my friend had the fish and chips, he seemed to enjoy those. i personally don't like that item so i didn't ask to try it.i would say that the service in the bar area is going to be different every time you go so don't get your hopes up. the food isn't anything special, it's just a quick place you can get a beer, in my own opinion.
it's a nice place to eat and hang out with people. we asked to sit by the bar and it didn't take long until someone came over to take our order. our waitress heather was very nice and attentive. while the bf and i were enjoying the appetizers and drinks, she would come and check up on us every now and then. we had the appetizer sampler and everything was pretty standard and good. they're similar to what you can get from tgi/chili's, etc. can't go wrong w/ ordering the sampler!in the end i would definitely come back more often during <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. i do recommend getting the green bean crispers! so good w/ the sauces that they give you.
i've always liked eating at applebee's, so when they finally opened one in my neighborhood i couldn't be happier. they always seem to have something i'm craving for, which gives their menu selections a huge kudos for me. they now also have health conscious menu selections, which i appreciate since i'm trying to be a bit more watchful on what i eat lately. the appetizers are awesome! service is very attentive and friendly. sometimes i swing by here to just sit at the bar during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and watch the game or have dinner here with my dad.and no matter how many times i've been here, i always end up staring at all the crap they got on the wall...it helps pass the time when you're waiting for your order.
bait and switch.its an applebees so i dont go in expecting much. &nbsp;decided to go because it was late and barely anything else open. &nbsp;i go in on a sunday and ask if they have late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the hostess says its not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but there are late night specials. &nbsp;she leads us to our table and gets the menu insert with the late night specials, points to it and says &quot;there, it's half price appetizers.&quot; &nbsp;at this point i'm feeling good because i know i can get what i want for not that much money. &nbsp;i order 3 things, mozzarella sticks, cheeseburger sliders and chicken wonton tacos. &nbsp;the waiters takes our order and we get our food. &nbsp;the food is fine, the service was fine. &nbsp;the problem came when we got our bill. &nbsp;the bill came out to $28. &nbsp;i was a little confused because i thought appetizers were half off. &nbsp;i ask the waitress and she says thats only monday - friday. &nbsp;i then explained to her that we were led to believe from the hostess that it also included today. &nbsp;the waitress apologizes and offers to go talk to her manager to see what they could do. &nbsp;she comes back and says since its football season they do have a special but it only applices to mozzarella sticks. &nbsp;i am still confused as to how they led me to believe it was half price for all apps. i was tired and didnt want to raise a big stink so i say thats fine. &nbsp;they took the half off for mozzarella sticks and $4 off as a discount. &nbsp;i still paid more than what i thought i was going to be paying. &nbsp;if one of your employees misinforms a customer you need to make the mistake right. &nbsp;this night applebees failed miserably. &nbsp;even though its so close to home i wont be coming back here. &nbsp;i'll take my chances with mcdonald's nuggets. &nbsp;at least i can be sure of how much i am going to pay.
chilis-grill-and-bar-diamond-bar
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sucks!! you need to sit in the bar area only to enjoy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and its sooo loud in there, plus their selections are sooo small and still expensive i think (for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that is)... menu could be better i find it a bit boring.. food is ok ...
birthday freebie and great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!free ice-cream brownie for your birthday with the purchase of an entree! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 3-7pm, $2.99/$4.99 food items and $4.50 margaritas! service was absolutely amazing! our bartender was second to none and really took care of us. food was pretty standard bar food, but that ice-cream brownie was absolutely to die for! warm and soft in the center, topped with a big scoop of ice-cream and warm fudge, each bite had a hint of caramel - heaven!super easy parking!
great place for sunday lunch. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day in thr lounge. remodeled with many tv's and great bartenders. come in and catch a game and a beer!
great place to grab a drink during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. food is decent with a lot of variety on the menu. it has a bar kind of atmosphere whether you sit at the actual bar or not. its nice to go to with friends
so the first thing we're told when we sit down is that they're out of the southwestern eggrolls...really??? it's barely 3pm and you're out of food!?! what kind of $h!t is that??? it's not like the place is jammed pack...it's relatively mild!!! if not for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the service, this would be less than three stars.
stopped in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with colleagues. not a huge fan of chilis anyways but was only place to go for a margarita near the office in diamond bar.1 star for service, which was decent but the drinks were not made well, i think i was drinking fruit juice, and i am not even exaggerating, &nbsp;lol. i ordered the mango patron margarita and the el nino- both were good tasting but you barely any alcohol. my friends had margaritas and they said the same thing. we also had tableside quacamole and chips-1 star for that because chips were hot, fresh and crispy and the guac, well, you cannot really go wrong with that.ambience for a thursday at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was okay, not a whole lot of people. all in all, would not go back by choice.
really not worth coming to unless you really crave mediocre food.i've tried their burgers and appetizers, and you'll get bettertasting food at in n out. no joke. very slow service, and a lack of it. i can't comment on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or the bar, but that seems tohave better reviews. come to watch the game or have a drink with your friends, not for a sit down meal with the family orwith a date. there are so many better restaurants right down the street in the village.
came here with my gf for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ordered the beef nachos and boneless wings and food was both mediocre. also got a large blue moon and everything was whatevers. nothing too special except they got these cool ziosk where u can order and pay through this little tablet looking things. do not order the queso skillet, it does not taste good and the complimentary chips and salsa were alot better.
i love coming to chili's because of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday. working late and craving something some what healthy chili's isn't a bad place to go. it is good place to bring a friend and take advantage of the 2 entrees for 20$ with appetizer. i enjoy the consistency of the food their pretzel chicken bacon sandwich is my go to order. also must try the table side gucamole the server brings out all the ingredients and mixes it in front of you. my only complaint at this chili's is the service. i'm not sure if it's just not enough servers or what the deal is coming around <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i typically sit at the bar and the tables are always not cleaned. waiting for the food always takes 20 min one time almost 30+. half the time the server is non existent luckily they have this new electronic that you can just slide your card to pay and just leave. i definitely have better serve experience at the puente hills location.
i'd give 3.5 if i could, but they get the lower end of the stick.chili's. &nbsp;food isn't that great. &nbsp;too salty for me. &nbsp;i've tried their steak and fajitas and wasn't impressed.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is decent. &nbsp;they start at 9pm (+1 star) and this is one of the two places in diamond bar that you can drink at &quot;late night&quot; (another +1) meaning past 9 pm that i know of at least...the other being oaktree lanes. &nbsp;there's <span class="highlighted">happy's</span>, but they don't serve hard, unless you count that &quot;ku&quot; soju. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> you get free thin and airy chips and salsa, which was blended and mild. &nbsp;hard is a buck off, and i think beer too. &nbsp; 50 cent buffalo wings, which were decent, and a queso dip for 3 or 4 bucks, i forget. &nbsp;i shared some kind of triple platter, and none of the items i got were very good (southwestern egg rolls, crispers (which were supposed to be chicken, but i swear it tasted like fish), and chili boneless wings, which tasted more like honey). &nbsp;service was great. &nbsp;constantly checked on us and very attentive.
i'd like to thank paul aoun &amp; the city of diamond bar for bringing chilis to diamond bar!!! it's a great fun place, great <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. lots of beers &amp; great margaritas. awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour's</span> 4-7, 9-close. tv's everywhere, music, well trained attentive staff &amp; good host of locals &amp; visitors. chilis original baby back ribs are to die for! they also make the best buffalo wings &amp; fajitas. tacos, turkey burgers, salads. prefer the original burgers over the new craft crap. super disappointed over that!! i like the &quot;simpler&quot; chili's of the past. this new, over-sized in variety &amp; overwhelming options..... not any of it is outstanding &amp; more over a chilis &quot;classic&quot;. &nbsp;drinks, meets, hangin out, it's a great choice! * fits in with our ranch country history
diamond bar does not have a lot of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> places, so chili's fills that abyss. located in the same area as target, it is hard to miss because it is literally at the southwest corner of grand ave. and golden springs dr.it gets packed friday evenings, but i have been here so many times that waiting is not even an issue for me. i love that the staff here are very friendly and accommodating, as well as quick and understanding.my usual orders are baby back ribs or a fish dish (the tilapia is pretty amazing, guys, especially the mango salsa!). i've had probably all their margaritas and my beer of choice is blue moon. i have also had long island cocktails, which are good too. i rarely am at the bar area because i usually dine with friends or family, so having a table gives us the opportunity to do our own thing.
chases-la-verne-la-verne
went to chase's for the first time last night with 4 of my friends. &nbsp;we all loved it. &nbsp;we ordered 5 appetizer's off their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and then 2 entrees, which we all shared. &nbsp;the food was very good. &nbsp;the boneless ribs in particular, with mashed potatoes and fresh grilled corn on the cob, was delicious! &nbsp;the mac &amp; cheese needed a little salt, but it was creamy and kind of light, which was a pleasant surprise.our waitress was excellent . . . willing to share her knowledge of the food and beverages and make accommodations as requested. &nbsp;she even prepared a &quot;special&quot; drink for us. &nbsp;one of my friends told the waitress she wanted to start slow, so she asked if they had lemonade (they did). &nbsp;then she asked if they had strawberry lemonade. &nbsp;the waitress told her they didn't but she could make it for her. &nbsp;then the waitress asked if she wanted a little vodka in it. &nbsp;my friend was up for that, and when it came it was sooo good. &nbsp;not too sweet or strong; just tasty and refreshing. &nbsp;we are definitely going back!oh, and one more thing we all loved . . . &nbsp;the prices on the menu include tax. &nbsp;i have never seen that done before and think it's wonderful - what you see is what you get!
if you go just for wine, its a pretty good place! &nbsp;i was very disappointed though the other night when we came here for dinner... the service was terrible! &nbsp;first the waitress had very little knowledge about the wine selections, and then my father had ordered a manhattan, she looked at him with a blank stare and asked how to make it! &nbsp;really!!! &nbsp;i understand it is a wine bar, but it also serves as a full service bar! &nbsp;my dad finally gave up and just ordered a beer. &nbsp;we ordered our food, i ordered the steak purses and artichoke dip off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, the purses were pretty good, but my dip was taken to another table (by our waitress) so i didnt get that til the very end of the night. &nbsp;my dad ordered the chases mac n cheese which was the most terrible mac n cheese i have ever had! &nbsp;he is a nice guy, so he wouldnt tell them it was terrible, but i couldnt get myself to try more then 2 bites! &nbsp;it was the most bland tasting thing i have tried in a while! &nbsp;dont try it!all in all, we had a terrible waitress and the food kept getting messed up or was late! &nbsp;like i said, if you are just going for the bar, make sure they know what they are doing... probably safe just to stick to wine and wine only!
pappas-artisanal-la-verne-3
this place has a great atmosphere. the service was excellent (thank you lisa!) and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is excellent. we ordered an appetizer and entrees and all the food was amazing. super fresh, really delicious, legitimate food!!!!!
i came here just at the end of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special with a couple of girlfriends. we got the kettle chips which were great and a steal during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at only $1. the service was great and i ordered the spinach and watercress salad and the truffled fries. both were awesome, but the fries were especially a standout! this would have been a 5 star review, except that as it got busier (it was a saturday night) the service suffered. if you are able, i recommend visiting during off times. i plan on trying more of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, and of course, those truffle fries again!
super great environment. we went for a friend's birthday lunch and the food was excellent, as was the delicious carmel iced coffee. the reason i tok of a star was they forgot to put some stuff on the sandwich that was supposed to come with it. but its a great gem. im sure <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> would be fun too.
delicious food, especially the baked potato fries! i was also obsessed with the coffee caramel ice cream float - i'm not usually a coffee person, but there's something about the combo of cold brew coffee, caramel and ice cream that speaks to me. the cobbler is also delicious, i only wish i were less full so that i could have enjoyed it properly. (: the prices are decent and i would love to come back again for the brunch or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> some day!
yum,yum,yum!! everything i have ever eaten there has been fantastic!!! i mean everything!! they have great daily specials on the menu, a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger. the staff is nice too. i wish the food cooked a little faster, but it is sooo worth the wait!! you won't be disappointed in your experience. the only thing i would change about this place is, more comfortable chair's. great atmosphere for everyone.
ate here for the first time today. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger special was great. food tasted delicious and the place had a cool vibe and friendly people. this will definitely be my new spot to eat before class.
nicely set up interior and from what i understand, the menu could be seasonal and they won't always serve the same dishes every time. &nbsp;i ordered the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger, had a side of truffle fries(?) and an agua fresca. &nbsp;the burger was on point and portioned just right for me, the potatoes however, i didn't really care for. &nbsp;they were fried potato discs with a truffle b&eacute;chamel sauce...but not enough b&eacute;chamel sauce...so really just fried potatoes. &nbsp;agua fresca was very refreshing and a great alternative to soda or overly sugared lemonades. &nbsp;i have yet to come back for the brunch.
i have always been a fan of pappas since they first open. they have a great selection of food and drinks but i really love their agua fresca. they also have an excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that i go every thursday after work and their prices are reasonable.what i really love about pappas is the dinner menu changes, i get to try different creations from chef travis. i highly recommend coming for lunch, dinner or sunday brunch.
we came here last monday not knowing they had dine la verne going on with a $30 3 course meal.didn't sound too enticing, all i was hoping for was that the limited menu still included the veggie burger.yup, score, all good, i am a sucker for a made in house veggie burger, always interesting to see how they make it and what its made of.this one was excellent, a mix of veggies and grains, not too mushy as most get, prepared and presented perfectly, great flavors.the side salad also good, a nice light and healthy feeling dinner for $11.it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so my husband ordered the burger off that menu, same as regular burger menu, just 4 oz instead of 5.he enjoyed it. my son got the kids meal with a burger and chips and liked it.my husband also got the chips off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and we shared one of each taco at were $1.50 each.i loved the fish and veggie one, though both on their own were lacking, i added the fish to the veggies, now that was good, amazing really.the steak and al pastor were good, but the fish and veggie better.the steak quesadilla is a better value than tacos if you are hungry, my husband really enjoyed that.also the free churros with check in, awesome!!!!even better when they are free, hot and crunchy, very tasty, perfect way to round off the meal!service was nice, very on top of things, food came out fast and made very well.i'll come back for the full menu or brunch next time, though the veggie burger is very much worth getting again.
we were in la verne area and decided to have brunch around the area. this place has a really neat inside structure and awesome ambiance. upon looking at the chalk board, they have sunday special menu.we ordered steak and eggs and the crumb cake. the steak n eggs came with 2 sunny side up eggs, hangar steak and the home fried potatos. they were delished. the crumb cake was awesome as well as there are real fruits on it (banana). i wouldn't mind going back there again, in fact, we are planning to go back to try out their sandwiches and for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
i really love this little gem! been here twice for brunch, once for lunch and twice for dinner. this isn't your typical &quot;sit down dinner place&quot;. but for me, that's perfect because sometimes i like light dinners. like a sandwich and salad. went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too, tacos are great! i guess you can say i'm a regular now and i'm proud to say that! i especially love that pappas supports and practice sustainability! awesome craft beers on tap and bottle. wine selection is great too! i love the music they play as well, which creates a cool environment. hands down the best new restaurant east of kellogg hill :)
absolutely fantastic little place in la verne. in the two weeks i have lived in the area, we have been here twice and i am can see this becoming a weekly spot for my little family. the space is open and pleasing to the eye, no too hipster, but hey just hipster enough (har har). i love the funky, mismatched furniture and teensy vases with wild flowers on each table and the nice, open feel to the place. the welcoming atmosphere makes this a &nbsp;great place for families, younger people, and &quot;older' patrons alike! i love seeing a mishmash of everyone enjoying a good meal when i come here.on to the food: they have awesome daily specials, however what i have been most impressed with is their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! they have the loveliest little 4 ounce burger and chips plate for $6.00! their prime rib sandwich is also divine, &nbsp;the meat is tender and juicy. even my picky 9 year daughter loves coming here and has raved about both the hh quesadilla and the children's pasta. they have great rotating beers on draft as well. service has always been prompt and friendly. first time visitors: be sure to check in for your churro treat, you will not be disappointed.
i've been coming here about twice a month for the better part of a year and i think it's time i gave them some props. i've been here for weekend brunch, lunch, and dinner. this place is delicious and uses really fresh and high quality ingredients. i love their lunch specials and often get a 1/2 sandwich and salad combo. they also have great baked potato fries and good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. i am a big fan of their agua fresca drinks which change regularly. the employees are also friendly and give good recommendations. the only downside is that they are a little expensive, but the quality of the food explains the extra cost. it's a little bonus that i get a discount because i am staff/faculty at the university.
good food! the staff is friendly, the food is good, the price is right...what more can you ask for? :)this is our third time here. the last time we came, i ordered a sangria. it was so good, i ate the orange slices when i was done! food wise...their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> wings are a good deal. &nbsp;the only problem is that the taste stays with you! the ramen i had was just okay. &nbsp;the best part about it was the tender slices of miso pork. &nbsp;i didn't care for the broth though. i had to use hot sauce to mask the flavor.my husband had their reuben sandwich and enjoyed it. the chips were very good! i enjoy coming here. ;)this evening my daughter ordered the fish and chips special. &nbsp;i couldn't believe how generous the fish serving was! &nbsp;her chips were good too.my salad was good. &nbsp;very tasty rotisserie chicken. &nbsp;the dressing was light. i enjoyed it. &nbsp;a lot to eat too!my husband and son both enjoyed their burgers. &nbsp;everyone was <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, <span class="highlighted">happy</span>! the best part, though, were the free churro with a check in! yum!
while my favorite item served here is still the ever-popular, utterly delicious chicken sandwich simply termed &quot;the signature chicken sandwich,&quot; and the market vegetable sandwich is still fresh and amazingly filling in its own right, i think something need be said about their enormous veggie burger. we are talking, the king of all veggie burgers outside of &nbsp;an la hipster joint. at the risk of sounding like guy fieri from 'diners, drive-ins, &amp; dives,' i actually thought i'd have to dislocate my jaw to bite into this thing. the texture of the patty itself is hearty, it isn't gamey like some processed veggie patties, (probably due to the fact that it's made in house). whatever seasonings and sauces they put in this thing, they're doing it perfectly. served in a brioche bun with a fried onion ring in the middle, this burger will make you wish you had two stomachs so you could order another one. almost everything here is made in-house with fresh, local ingredients. and their coffees, particularly their cold brew and iced caramel latte, are absolutely delicious and perfectly balanced. and if you're a booze-lover, you're in luck! their craft beers and cocktails alone are worth coming here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the menu, overall, is unique and diverse; sure to please just about anyone who walks through those doors.
1st time, it was a yelp tasting event. tried few thingskettle chips- too salty for my likingpotato wedges- i only like crispy skinny fries, so this one wasn't to my liking either.signature chicken sandwich- amazing, the only place can compete with it was the one in sf near pier 33.al pastor sandwich- too much sauce but it wasn't bad. i don't like anything when you eat the sauce is dripping make finger dirty.few different kind teas- were served in dipping sauce kind containers so because i was thirsty they were all good but wasn't enough to quench the thirst at all. (for the amount served it's hard to tell if it is good )churros- i don't like this soft version churros but it was hot and fresh so some people might like it.2nd time, we met there for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4-6pm)we managed to arrive 10 mins before 6pm and placed our order. the waitress said as long as she put the order in computer before 6.kettle chips ($0.5)- still don't like it, my dining partner ate most of it. i don't feel it much different from a bag of chips.d street burger ($6)- i asked for medium rare but it was more like medium. not bad but i wasn't impressed.street taco ($1.5/ea)- meat was very dry and over cooked. avoid!!! worst taco ever.peach oolong tea ($2.5) i normally like anything unsweetened but this one is slightly bitter. not much of a peach.churros (free with check in)- tried again but still didn't like it.the environment is very pleasant and quiet. perfect for hang out or alone reading a book. service was very nice. i just couldn't give this &quot;might be a gem in la verne&quot; place more than 3 stars because most of its food fall into fancy but mediocre taste.
came in on a tues at about 1 :30pm, not many people, but steady as peeps came in to pick up phoned in orders.service was walk-up and they bring the food to you when it is ready. the space is really cool, nice open, bright space decorated very nicely in that industrial look. great outdoor patio, and its bigger that it looks from the outside. on the south end of d street right in the heart of dt laverne. **we tried**melon-ginger aqua fresca, lemon ice tea, onions rings, albacore sandwich, chicken jalapeno soup, and the chicken sandwich.here are my thoughts:the agua fresca, which i was so looking forward to, was a little disappointing. (they do give small samples which was really nice) today the choice was melon-ginger. &nbsp;i was expecting a refreshing melon aspect but just wasn't getting mouthwatering melon-ness. i would like to try other flavors sometime. the lemon iced tea just tasted weird. real lemon in regular black or green tea would have been better i think. lots of beers to choose from.the soup was good, hearty, and piping hot. i love that! maybe a little thicker, throw some corn in there and it would be crazy delicious.the sandwiches were on the skimpy side. i wish they were bigger, juicier, messier, hotter, and had more wow factor upon presentation, ie. &quot;i'm not sure i'll finish this&quot;. the chicken one needed more chicken, more sauciness, and some other note, the flavors were a bit muddied i thought. but it was still good, solid 3 stars. i liked the flavors, especially the albacore--fresh chunks of tuna, lightly covered in tartar sauce, and fresh herbs. i felt it needed more of the shaved fennel. i liked the arugula on it. i tried it dipped in a bit of their green goddess dressing and it really turned it up a notch.the onion rings were mostly &nbsp;limp strips. the flavor was fantastic but they would have been easier to eat and more enjoyable had they held their shape a bit more. they came without dipping sauce, so i asked for ranch. no ranch, but &nbsp;they had homemade green goddess and sriachia aoli. i requested both. man, the sriacha was fantastic! i suggest they serve these two on the side for every order. bet it would be fantastico on the baked potato fries too!!all in all, this place has great potential. i love the concept and hope more people go and try it. a few tweaks and i am sure it will be a 5-star. look forward to going back soon. looks like they have some great brews on tap and a promising <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
so, a friend told us about the potato nest. i hopped on yelp and read about these exotic unique iced tea flavors and between the two, i was sold. went down there and this place is great!! i rarely give 5 stars, but it's under $10, the food is fresh, creative, unique and eclectic (not to mention scrumptious). the iced teas are killer and i want to order everything on the menu. the also offer beers on tap and wines too. very foodie friendly.speaking of the menu, it's perfect--it offers just enough to be interesting and is diverse enough to satisfy whatever craving i might be having at any given moment, but it isn't so overwhelming like some places where they try to do everything so nothing is really done spectacularly. i was really impressed that the chef was also out wiping down the glass doors when there was a lull in customers and when i talked to him about the food, he was passionate but not hell's-kitchen-obsessive-unpleasantly-ocd-and-snobby passionate. i love that he's proud of his food and skills, but not too proud to help out elsewhere around the store! and the owner, matt, was incredibly gracious and friendly. in fact, both the servers were too. i love it when a restaurant smiles.it's got a little bit of an industrial, hipster, modern warehouse feel with lots of wood, concrete, metal and chalkboard decor (think eureka burger in claremont with more natural lighting and no booths). its counter service, so if it's busy, get someone to grab a table (there's plenty of seating, thankfully) and bring some menus back to the table to mull over before ordering. i think there's a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4.30-6.30 in the afternoons and a sunday brunch, which they close at 3pm.they've been open a grand total of 14 days, so there was a tiny hiccup or two, which they fixed...with a smile. i have a feeling this place is gonna take off...i sure hope so!! but don't make the place a madhouse and make the lines too long. i need my iced tea! go matt and travis!p.s. i read a filtered review that complained about $9 sandwiches. i'd agree $9 is too much...but i think they may have changed their prices in response b/c i don't remember anything being nine bucks. i think the prices are okay for what they're offering. i certainly wouldn't complain if they lowered prices, but i also don't feel like i'm being robbed and i definitely walk away full (unlike at sushi joints, which i love, but where i plunk down twenty bucks and then still have to stop by a burger joint on the way home).
this place: cute and has some of the friendliest customer service i've experienced in a while. the place seems super nice inside, very homelike and welcoming. pappas artisanal has a dog friendly patio with some shade (wear sunglasses and sunblock.. both the husband and i got a little sunburned after just a few <span class="highlighted">hours</span>). the patio has a few picnic tables in located in the front of the restaurant. i was looking to have bottomless mimosas brunch on a sunday, somewhere were i could take my little pooch too. we thought it could be a bit more crowded being that it was a beautiful day that weekend but thankfully it wasn't. we were seated and helped right away.the food:we looked over the menu a few times and yelp of course. we did realize that during brunch they only serve brunch. there is some brunch specials that are not on the menu that you can ask your server to provide. my meal was one of them. i ordered the chicken and waffles to go with my bottomless mimosas. their meats are all hormone free which mean great quality. the chicken was non-greasy and not overly battered. i honestly loved that. the waffle was good too, nothing special about it though. the chicken is what made the dish. bottomless mimosas served from 9.00am to 2.00pm ($15). you have the option of choosing agua fresca or orange juice, and our awesome waiter mentioned that i am more than <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to alternate if i wanted to try the agua fresca one too, which i did. both are delicious and did the job of getting me real buzzed.service: outstanding. we had more than one waiter/waitress come around and check up on us to make sure we were doing alright. they also brought out a water bowl for my doggie and made sure he had clean water all the time. i also loved that they did not slow me down on my mimosa intake haha. woo!!tip: check in on yelp and you get some hot and fresh churros which are amazing!! you will totally not regret it at all. ****dog friendly*****#125/2014
this place is awesome. my girlfriend and i happened upon this place based on the fact that they hook you up with a churro if you check in here. so glad we did!we came in to eat a little something before we went on a run, we ordered the pap pap wings and our free churro. the wings were like no wings i have tasted before, they had their own sauce and they were full wings they were tender and juicy. i liked everything about them. the churro was also really good. it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and very flavorful. and everything we ordered was hot! always a plus. the owner actually came out and talked to us for a bit while we were drinking some water and hanging out the place has a &quot;i'm home&quot; feeling to it. all our food was gone so we left and ran our run. we decided to go back for dinner. we live in northern california in the bay area so we wanted to try their dinner menu while we still could. we were greeted with warm welcomes since they recognized us from a few <span class="highlighted">hours</span> before and were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to see us. we sat down and out server was cole. he was super attentive and answered all of our questions. we asked if we could try their specialty home tea drinks and he brought us out little tasting cups totally above and beyond. we got a tea and the mule (vodka and ginger beer).we ordered the fried brussel sprouts and burrata for appetizers the brussel sprouts were cooked just right and covered in this amazing citrus juice. and the burrata was sweet and the squash was perfect. the bread was toasted and warm and amazing. i would almost classify this as a dessert is was so delicious.for main course i got the pappas braised bacon ramen, and my girlfriend couldn't decide between the catch of the day (yellow tail and fennel and farro) or the pasta special (fusilli and white sauce) soo we got both. we normally share everything we get anyway.the ramen was amazing. the bacon was (just like everything else) cooked to perfection and it was served in a cute asian style cooking pot. it was hot and had just the right amount of everything in it. the yellow tail was also very good it had fennel which i only recently discovered as an eatable and i have learned i really like it and farro with is like oatmeal and rice had a baby. the pasta was my girlfriends favorite. i snuck a few bites in here and there, but she was all about it. it had little bits of some kind of meat in it (i saw it but didn't eat enough of it to be able to tell you what as it was being horded on the other side of the table) but the bites i did get reminded me of home cooking if your mom was a professional chef and knew what she was doing. it was really creamy and amazing.for dessert we just got 1 cookie we were stuffed and taking most of the food as left overs. but that cookie. i wish there were more left when we ordered as we got the least one, white chocolate chip apricot. heavenly. now the food was amazing. and the atmosphere was amazing. my girlfriend also was excited to hear they had little dragon pandora playing. but being a server in the past for years, i am very strict when it comes to my food servers. and cole was awesome. attentive, with all of the food we brought to the table he checked to make sure we were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with it. our glasses were never empty and actually spent time answering our questions and talking to us. i don't like feeling like we are just another table and always appreciate it when our servers care. and he got all of our order correct the first time. i can't say enough good things about the food, the dining room, or the service. this is a 100% going back next time i'm in so cal.

i love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!!!
saw that this place opened up and so wanted to check it out. we came here and it was dead empty, but it seems relatively unknown. it looks nice enough, and there's a few big tvs where you can watch games and whatnot. we got a combo meal, which only comes with coors lite(lame). fortunately they were out of coors lite and so we got upgraded to kirin for free. the salty nuts they give as free appetizers are interestingly tasty. they're a bit different from the average peanut, they're salty but have somewhat of a sweet tingle. for food we ordered the tong dak(full roasted chicken), which was just eh. after eating a little bit i was not impressed, i've had way better elsewhere. my friend also got these beef kebobs. they looked delicious, but i was fooled. i took a bite and it was so bland. there was sauce on it, but it definitely looks better than it tastes. not that it was bad, it was just so average.i'll probably come back here, if anything to check out the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and watch a game. it's ok. not good, not bad.
grand opening in diamond bar~really? i'm down to try some new places as usual....but.... unfortunately, i didn't like this place at all. &nbsp; the owners of new garden restaurant shouldn't have opened this place. &nbsp; however, the ambiance (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmnwxka4-ke9ewg-bmnog?select=aephmyfhho5dsgdmm3dc9q#aephmyfhho5dsgdmm3dc9q">yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmn…</a>) is great and there are a lot of tvs in here so you can enjoy a few drinks, music, and a sports game on tv. &nbsp;service is also pretty good and friendly. &nbsp;they do have a call button if you need them for anything.so we ordered tong-dahk and ddukbokki.the tong-dahk (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmnwxka4-ke9ewg-bmnog?select=lqz_gfz5al80yvfbrdnk3q#lqz_gfz5al80yvfbrdnk3q">yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmn…</a>) was not prepared well and didn't taste good. &nbsp;also, they don't have the standard machinery to make the tong-dahk, so it's just fried which resulted in it being super dry inside and lacked flavor. &nbsp;i still have yet to find a yummy tong-dahk spot around the sgv-ie area.the moo (cubed pickled radish) -http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmnwxka4-ke9ewg-bmnog?select=lv9f5myhzsmum1v8vvfrqg#lv9f5myhzsmum1&shy;v8vvfrqg. &nbsp;this was old and disgusting. &nbsp;it wasn't sweet enough. &nbsp;if you are looking for really delicious moo, go to bbq chicken in db for them.the ddukbokki (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmnwxka4-ke9ewg-bmnog?select=gzqhj0y5jak3jvk1pssktw#gzqhj0y5jak3jvk1pssktw">yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmn…</a>) was too sweet and salty. they put too much soy sauce in there and should have added more gochujang instead. &nbsp;they don't give you a lot of dduk, either. &nbsp;to me, again, bbq chicken stands #1 in quality (but not in price) when it comes to ddukbokki.the prices aren't really bad, but they aren't really good either with the portions. &nbsp;i'm hoping in the near future they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or specials with their drinks and ahnjoo. &nbsp; when they do, i'll be back and try out their other items. &nbsp; since they are new, i'll give them a few months to fix their food and menu. &nbsp;for the area, i'm only giving them 5 stars for ambiance, service, and friendliness. &nbsp;it's also known to be a good place to drink and chill with your friends, so food shouldn't be expected to be all that great.l

wings are awesome. tons of flavored to choose from. service can be slow. but overall a great place to come for beer and food. they have a solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is all day sunday and they have all kinds of other specials during the week.
wide variety of yummy wings * awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> * chill environment. contemporary decor. friendly staff.
great atmosphere and wings. we had the tequila lime, spicy cajun and the danger hot. the tequila lime was average but the other two were phenomenal. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> us super legit.
i wish i would have known of this spot sooner! i love it wings on point and the service was great and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is nice
used to be great, now they're awful. they used to offer half-orders of appetizers, not anymore. used to have $2 domestic pints, not anymore. want to enjoy food and drink when there's a ufc fight or other ppv event, be ready to pay a cover to get in. i ordered an appetizer off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and was brought what i ordered. little did i know, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and regular size plates are different. the server said i didn't specify &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; and the manager refused to reduce the price. on another visit, i was brought an appetizer that had been in the window long enough to overcook the cheese and make it hard and crusty. when i sent it back, the cook said, &quot;that's just how it's made.&quot;i used to love this place, now i will never go back.
came here for the ufc tonight and was having a good time ordering from their pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu...until the bill came. apparently the waitress assumed we wanted the full size order of everything and proceeded to charge full price for everything. when we explained we were ordering from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and pointed out that we had been pointing to the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu as we ordered the manager only offered to discount a portion and refused to work with us. instead of earning loyal ufc customers they lost them for good. we paid the bill and will definitely not be coming back. personally i think the waitress purposely put in the full size order. if you have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> going on they should be be confirming what the order is. bad management and leadership.
i really enjoy their food. i can't complain about that. i bring all my friends so we can hang out and have good food. the problem that they have is their service. when you dine in. it takes forever for the waitress or waiter to pass by. they run out of drink menus that they have to be passing it around the ones they find. don't like the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. when you think of &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot;. you think of drinks, you don't want a free soda before 5pm. &nbsp;you don't want to wait till 9pm to start to drink. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> should start earlier especially after work. another annoying thing is their carry out. they never answer the phone the first time that we need to call back two or three times.
very solid place for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ton of tv's great bar great atmosphere. service is ok, however there drink specials and food is great. would recommend going
great atmosphere only sit outside if you don't mind smoke, &nbsp;don't get well drinks during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they are watered down stick to what's on tap or bottles, &nbsp;slow service on farmers market day thursday, &nbsp;dirty patio. food is ok had better wings elsewhere over salty.
so far so good. food is good. large beer mugs. friendly service today. the beers are huge!!!!! they've got a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and they show all the games. you can even request ones that aren't playing.we are huge ku fans (husband's from ks) and they played it on the huge screen for us. we had a lovely waitress xanthe. she was so nice and always checking up on us.
update to my past review, the problem was with the online delivery, since that review they have not made any mistake with further orders. i've always been a big fan of all the food, its very good. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great, and the wait staff is always very nice and friendly. i highly recommend this place, specifically if you are going to walk in, also its a good place for group events.
solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals! our waitress seemed to think they were a real bargain but i don't know if 1 dollar off a 9 dollar ipa is as much of &quot;a steal&quot; as she thinks. but nice try. our group ordered bbq and garlic parmesan wings, some buds and ipas, a french dip sandwich, a chicken caesar wrap with fries, and chips and salsa - thanks to the yelp check-in offer. they brought carrots and celery with ranch on the house as well.i was a fan of the wings! crispy, meaty, and dripping with sauce. my boyfriend and i shared the 12-wing platter - it was really yummy! my friends seemed to enjoy their orders. i tried a bite of the french dip sandwich, which was too salty for her to finish and me to try more than just a bite. the salsa was warm and chunky, and seems homemade. even then, you probably won't see me checking in a second time!
so...i have to say i have been here many times!! &nbsp;the boneless wings--they shrank about 3 sizes---tiny, tiny, tiny..totally not worth it! &nbsp;also, i have used many <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restaurant.com</a> coupons since i dont know when, during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, this time not accepted....i was totally not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with that at all....supposedly they honored many of them, but mine! &nbsp;just not a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> experience today for me with house of wings.....definitely will b a while until i come back....unfortunately not the same customer service as other places!!
first time going to house of wings . went on a friday at 9pm. called 2 times before going for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> times had two employees tell me 8pm till close. i get there at 9pm waitress informs me it's 5pm-8pm. the service was slow and our waitress was negligent. &nbsp;had the buffalo chip app which was not good. the wings were edible nothing special. do not get tangerine flavor it had no taste. my first and last visit.
first time here. granted we got there not long before closing. quickly ordered. i had a buffalo chicken wrap and fries. it was decent. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> till close was nice. blue moon on tap, always nice. ill give the place another shot
this is a welcome addition to the very dead downtown la vernei have only been here during lunch or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so my review is based on that time frame. (i have heard they play loud club music at night, but i have had no such experience). service has always been friendly and attentive. for all you sports fans there are a ton or tvs!the wings are fantastic and certainly live up to the name of this joint. the menu is very eclectic including some delicious seafood and salad options. the portions are huge so i have made it a point to share. they have an ok beer selection including a few craft handles and a couple standard domestics. i was also impressed with their low price on buffalo trace bourbon $5 for a healthy pour and $4 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. my boyfriend has been brave with trying their specialty cocktails but hasn't been to impressed. it seems best to stick to beer or basic cocktails (ie. vodka cran, jack n' coke ect.) i will be back!
best sports bar i've been to in a while. the food was beyond amazing (lemon pepper, my fave), the sliders (with bacon), the irish nachos? must try! i love sauces, and their ranch especially (which is made in-house) is out of this world! there is literally a tv every 10 inches, so it's the perfect sports bar. lakers won last night, so it was particularly perfect. we were a party of 20, and the waitress (didn't get her name, but she was a short haired blonde), was on top of her game. overall, if you're in the area, looking for a chill spot to kick it with friends, or get plastered during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, this is the place to be.
we found this place on our way to the la county fair. stopped in for some weekend <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, before being forced to pay $9 for a beer at the fair. the wings are delicious! we ordered them buffalo style, extra spicy. also ordered the spicy fried pickles, but those werent spicy at all. but still very yummy. the beer specials were good. i think they offered bud light and coors light for $2.50 on hh. i ordered a couple sam adams octoberfests ($4) and my sister had a few miller lights. the service was good. they have a nice bar area and outdoor patio.
their service is top notch ! fast , friendly, and hardworking. you won't sit with an empty glass for longer than a minute, because the waitress is always there to make sure you are satisfied ! their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is awesome and their appetizers are delish!! we ordered 12 piece wings / 6 spicy bbq and 6 tangerine . my husband loved the spicy bbq however i wasn't really <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the tangerine , but oh well, will know for next time to order something else . my friend got me to try artichoke spinach on flat bread and it was amazing!!! same opinion goes to irish nachos ! yummy! great place to watch the game, get your booze in and have some good food!
been there 3 times now and food has been good just expensive in my opinion 8 bucks for zucchini fries and &nbsp;13 bucks for artichoke dip? &nbsp; i usually wait 10 min for a waitress and another 15 before i got my beer when its not even busy . the thing that really gets me upset about this place is there so called &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; for half the price at certain times you can get discount drinks and food but what you really get is just that half the drink or half the food. it's not the normal size bloody mary or normal size nachos it's half the size or less in my opinion for half the price which isn't a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they should tell you that on the menu because it's false advertising to have a &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu &quot; that's just smaller portions you end up paying the same amount if you want the full size. just don't be fooled by that, other then that the food is pretty tasty if you don't mind your wallet getting really light by the time you leave.
i am really disappointed about this placeit is bear our house and looks like a fun locationit was 4 of us with a very simple order including a salad and nachos we received the burgers and the wings 40 minutes later even though there was only 5 tables that had clients when i asked about the salad and the nachos that we ordered for appetizers, the server looked puzzled and was surprised that we did not get them yet, another guy came to confirm that we did not get the appetizers and looked puzzled as well. i told them that it is ok and that we do not need them since the food is already herea waitress came and looked mad when she questioned why we no longer need the nachos and saladsit was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but stil km was charged full price for the drinksthey still brought the salad and was charged 6.99 for it
i have visited this restaurant ever since it opened several years ago, but it has been going steadily downhill for the last few years. this most resent visit has been the worst.  &nbsp;this place is obviously known for their wings. i think that's the only thing i've ever ordered here. the service has declined steadily and seems to be regularly under-staffed.  &nbsp; &nbsp;i was seriously disappointed with the quantity of food for the price, only because i remember the original servings for less money. not to mention the non- <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price for a 28-30 oz draft pomona queen was $9! &nbsp;i usually order the 8 piece boneless wings with fries...now $7.99. not a horrible price if you get decent proportions. the chicken pieces were tender and the sauce tasty, but the pieces have steadily decreased in size. my biggest beef is the fries serving... i mean, really? is it that costly to put a few more fries on your plate, especially since the chicken pieces are smaller? when i brought this to the waitresses attention she even agreed with me!  &nbsp;so, in summary, it's tasty, but servings are small and a bit overpriced. now, the good part is they have good tv viewing from every seat for that great game!
when this place first opened, i was really excited, because i thought it was just what la verne needed--a laid back sports bar with cheap food and drinks near the college campus. however, with each visit, i have become increasingly unhappy with the overall experience and customer service.the wings are pretty good, and i'm also a fan of their salads and other entrees (chicken saut&eacute;ed with vegetables is my personal favorite). portions are large and perfect for sharing. however, prices have gone up significantly since they first opened--$15 for saut&eacute;ed chicken and vegetables?! definitely overpriced.as for drinks, they have some good micro brews on tap and a full bar. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials used to be awesome--$2.50 for a bud light, margarita mondays w/$2 (i think) off all margaritas, etc. this was the place to come, especially on sunday with hh all day! now, bud light is $3.50 (this is bud light we're talking about!), and the last time i ordered a margarita, i was told the special applies only to the house margarita (even though the hh menu on each table clearly says all margaritas)...lame. seems like they keep changing everything to make more money, but they're losing business in the process.they have trivia on monday nights with gift card rewards for the top 3 teams. this has always been an awesome way to relax after work on the crappiest day of the week. however, we were informed this week that gift cards may not be used on the night they are won; you must come back another time to redeem them...lame.overall, service is just ok (we're in there every monday, so we get taken care of pretty well, but it can take awhile to get our food), but all the (unreasonable, in my opinion) price increases and caveats to hh, gift card redemption, etc. are what's making my opinion of this place slowly decline. oh, and they scored a b from the health department and posted it inside rather than in the window like they're supposed to. bottom line is that they opened a sportsbar, and they need to start operating it like one.
first time ordering food for delivery and it was not a good experience. first off, it took an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and a half to arrive. food was cold (not a total deal breaker. we own a microwave and are starving), but on top of this, the order was also wrong. i asked for no tomato or mayo. sandwich had no tomato, but was completely dry. it was supposed to have ranch. they also put tomatoes on my salad and forgot the salad dressing. i called back and just mentioned the dressing (most important at this point, to make the food edible) and the manager offered to send the driver back, so now my food continues to get colder and colder and frustration over this crap meal i paid $40 for, grows and grows! i'm down the street!! ugh! just terrible... do not recommend delivery! what a waste. not <span class="highlighted">happy</span>!!
today, new years day, went to this place only because our favorite place two doors down (t phillips) was closed. but were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to give it a try, since we had not been there yet. &nbsp;first impression - very nice. decor was chic, and modern and very classy. &nbsp;they put money into this place. &nbsp;the hostess sat us immediately and gave us some water and said our waitress would be with us soon. &nbsp;a good 10 to 15 mins &nbsp;later the manager came over, explained they were short staffed and they weren't even going to open today. (they had &nbsp;maybe 6 tables with &nbsp;two people at each one) &nbsp; and asked if we wanted a drink. &nbsp;we said we were ready to order, food and drink. &nbsp;as we were telling him our order the only waitress in the place came and took the order. &nbsp;the rose bowl was on so we wanted simple bar food- nachos and wings. &nbsp;both were good, and that's why they get the two stars, because service was a negative. &nbsp;the waitress was nice and did well. &nbsp;the manager and the guy who looked &quot;ownerish&quot; &nbsp;in the yellow sweater vest. who kept peeking around the corner hoping the customers would leave so he could go home, both were lacking. &nbsp;they could of helped out. &nbsp;and here is the kicker.... just as service couldn't get worse it does! &nbsp;we are watching the rose bowl football game - this is a sports bar. &nbsp;about half way thru the second quarter we decide to order some sliders. &nbsp;they take all of 10 mins tops to cook. &nbsp;the waitress comes back to our table and says just so you know we are closing at 5:00. &nbsp;umm seriously - that is just over an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and a half. &nbsp;we told her to forget the order. and hand us our check. &nbsp;we figured half time was starting and we could get home before the second half started. &nbsp;a sports bar was going to close with customers still ordering and watching the game of the day? &nbsp;all the while mr. yellow vest guy kept peeking around the corner wondering how much longer he had to stay.this place could of taken advantage of the awesome t phillips being closed and showed us great service, so we would have to come back again and again. &nbsp;but they made it easy on us, we wont be back. &nbsp;we will be two doors down spending our $50.00 to $70.00 bucks a week. &nbsp;food was good. &nbsp;decor was good. &nbsp;service was terrible. &nbsp;the waitress was fine and got her 15% tip, we usually tip more. &nbsp;but the manager and yellow vest guy were pathetic. &nbsp;and whoever made the waitress come over and say they were closing in an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and a half was bad business. &nbsp;pathetic. &nbsp;either be open and serve your customers, or be closed - &nbsp;half ass, got you a bad review, and two people who wont be back.
boulevard-574-diamond-bar-3
love their sandwiches and potato salad. great atmosphere and inside and outside seating. great place for an intimate <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in the evening with plenty if beer selections.
the establishment used to be known as boulevard bagels but is known as boulevard 574, and now serve alcohol drinks. not sure if they are the same owner. my office recently moved into the building next door and i was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to be able to have a restaurant like boulevard 574 right next to us. so far, i have only ordered to-go on 2 separate occasions to try out different items from their breakfast and regular menu. the door leading to the establishment is a bit oddly placed, but it is the same door from boulevard bagels i am not sure if one could walk through the gated outdoor seating in but their main door is to the right parking lot, not to the left parking lot. first time i called in, no one picked up the phone. my co-worker next tried and they finally picked up the phone. they noted that breakfast <span class="highlighted">hours</span> were only until 11:30 so i couldn't order my breakfast wrap. i decided upon the goddess (avocado, spinach, cucumber, tomato, onion sprouts, with chive cream cheese on a whole grain ciabatta, served with a side of potato salad). my co-worker ordered the garlic &amp; herb fries to try. after 15 minutes, i walked over to pick up our ordered items. there definitely is a different vibe than before as boulevard bagels. the cashier was really nice. one thing that peeved me though was that after paying with my $20, she did not give me any change. yes, it may have been $0.29 but i would like to have the option of giving it as tip or not. since it was not just my order, i had to get change for my co-worker's fries as well. i did not speak up but it really just peeved me. the ingredients of the goddess were all very fresh. i'm normally not a all veggie type of sandwich person but the ingredients went well together and the bread was super fluffy and soft. very fresh. the potato salad was also very good. there were no ingredients overpowering the other. my co-workers garlic &amp; herb fries were also perfect. loved how crispy they came out and the flavors were very fresh. good portion and the sauce that came with it was really good match, with a little kick. the 2nd time, my other co-worker was able to get breakfast and he ordered a french toast (coasted in fresh eggs &amp; cream, pan fried with whipped cream cinnamon &amp; maple syrup) to try and i finally got my breakfast wrap (eggs, potatoes, ham, cheese, tomato, green onion, &amp; green chili). the breakfast wrap was a good portion and it came with salsa.more than 65'% of my wrap were all eggs and some green onion, ham, and some cheese. there weren't any potatoes until the last 35%. i was quite disappointed. as much as i love eggs, i would like a more balanced mixture of ingredients in the wrap. as always, all the ingredients were really fresh and the parchment paper and foil kept my wrap warm for quite awhile. great wrapping for a to-go item. as a co-worker said, boulevard 574 serves great good with irvine prices. it's great that a place like this has opened up in db and hope that they stay open for awhile. their menu is quite simple and the food more than speaks for itself. i cannot attest to the atmosphere of the establishment, the alcohol drinks, or the service from the servers but overall, they put out great food.
zendejas-mexican-restaurant-san-dimas
this place is cool, i enjoy the taquitos the most! very nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
the food is really expensive for it not being great. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu sucks!!!!. would rather go somewhere else. plus is the dodger game and chips and salsa. would not recommend this place go somewhere else. 2 shrimp tacos for $15.50??? are you kidding me? what a ripoff.
this review is on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it occurs between 3-7 pm. prices are great and around $4. however, there was only one server at the bar which made service poor. it took awhile to get refills, food, and bill. it wasnt the waitress' fault though. i blame management.
went there for the kings game, took them a half <span class="highlighted">hour</span> just to change one tv, missed 20 minutes of the game that i came on time for.chips and salsa were gone on one person before they changed the channel (asked 4 times).had 3 dos equis and one shot during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, bill came out to $37. i asked for taquitos twice and the waitress kept looking at me as if i had never asked, still never got them.i can't say the food is good since they didn't want to make me any.i left and finished watching the game at red robins, saved a lot more money, too!
lots of tv's, spacious, good place to watch a game. &nbsp;don't go hungry, the food sucks. &nbsp;ordered a sampler appetizer for $16.95, and got french fries, 4 cheese sticks, a few poppers and 4 wings! &nbsp;that's it!!!! &nbsp;for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they will try to sell you 3 tacos for $6.50....what a deal! &nbsp;memo to zendejas, have you ever heard of $1 tacos?????
yuck! went there on saturday night with my boyfriend, we sat in the bar. &nbsp;there was a menu on our table that said &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, every day 3-9p.m.&quot; &nbsp;we were there this past saturday night at 7:30 p.m. so we figured we'd order something from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;once we decided, a waitress came over (it took quite a while for her to get to us and it was not crowded) to take our orders. &nbsp;she saw us about the order something off of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and told us that was only monday through friday. &nbsp;we politely pointed out that the sign said &quot;every day&quot; in big bold letters. &nbsp;she said it used to be every day but not anymore. &nbsp;my boyfriend told her she should probably take the sign off the table then since they weren't honoring their own signs. &nbsp;she told us no because they want the customers to know thee was a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;she did not handle the situation well at all and just kept saying &quot;ummmm&quot;. &nbsp;we ordered 2 beers and decided to just leave after that and eat and rink somewhere else. when my boyfriend gave her a card to pay with, she said we need a $10 minimum to pay with a card. &nbsp;we were already frustrated with the misleading signs all over the tables and just wanted to get out of there already so he ordered a shot and we left right away. &nbsp;it was nasty inside and the cover band was horrible.
this review is for the margaritas only. my boyfriend and i came for a couple <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> margaritas a few weeks ago and literally took two sips, paid, and left. the worst margarita i have ever had in my life. i saw the bartender shoot something out of the gun into it. perhaps water? because it tasted like a 5 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> old drink that they forgot about and served. we left to casa del rey and went for the good stuff. if that's how the drinks taste, i can only imagine the food.
there's a mixed crowd of younger and older people.the dress code is relaxed, just a collar shirt and no baggy cloths. the live bands are good and the dj really plays the music we grew up with, combined with some top 40 music. the $2 tacos are bomb after drinking all night. the security is very aware and courteous. the only drawback is they no longer serve tacos on friday night. they only serve them on friday from 3pm-8pm for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $1 tacos $2 beers and $2 margaritas. they do have great band called &quot;steel rod&quot; every thursday with no cover charge.it could use some new furniture. overall, the atmosphere makes up for the average setup.
red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-dimas-2
pretty good. it sucks they don't have any <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. the waitress said the prices are low like <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but ehhh i can find cheaper drinks.food is always a plus! very nice bar area.
met some coworkers here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.....or so we thought. &nbsp;after a couple drinks we get ready to order some apps and the waitress tells us that they have done away with the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;a few of the drinks have prices that are more than the old <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but less than regular price. &nbsp;the food is good (hence the 3 stars), endless fries are great (we miss the basket of fries, ditch the hammered cup!), but please put some tequila in the margaritas!
awww-red robin. the best burgers and fries in town. i've come to this place so many times and the waiters and manager is always so nice. the wait is never more than a couple minutes and its a very popular spot. the food is great!! get the bbq burger it is delicious!! the steak fries are great too-add the seasoning and try them with the campfire sauce!! you can also have a basket of fries while you wait for free if you ordered a burger or sandwich-just ask.also they have a cool <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the freckled lemonades are great too-free refills and they have great raspberry and strawberry margaritas. give em a shot! its very affordable. 2 people can walk out completely satisfied for around $20. also they have a diced chicken parmigana pasta that is not on the menu-but they still serve it and it is great!!
i know red robin is that burger place that everyone seems to go to, but we had a freakin' blast!! there was four of us and we sat right at the bar top. the service was excellent!! tevan was a bar tender and he did a great job getting our food and drink orders out quick. not to mention that he put up with my loud (boston native) boyfriend with flying colors! automatic kudos if you aren't annoyed by the loudest person in the place. the drinks were great. not too weak but strong enough to give you that lovely buzzed feeling after a few. ;) the burgers as always were yummy! cooked perfect and just big enough for my boyfriend and i to spilt and still have room for our cocktails. we missed the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but we will be going back to check it out.
read some fellow yelpers reviews before posting mine. shaun is right. this one is the best of the rest. &nbsp;anaheim is unbelievably slow and west covina (closest to me) is a veritable zoo! &nbsp;always go to san dimas for our rr fix but ontario is only second cause of the distance! &nbsp;love the burnin' love burger. &nbsp;erin, the chief server in the bar area, is a god-send cause she always makes sure that glasses don't run dry and that's including water! &nbsp;the new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great if you are a beer person but not so much if you are a mixed drinks one. &nbsp;servers on the floor that are top notch are paul and steven (not sure on that second name but the young man looks like jim parsons).
coming back from vegas on a thursday night and driving on the 15, we weren't expecting a lot of traffic. &nbsp;to our surprise, the 210 west was packed, due to the closure of 3 lanes. &nbsp;we had to wait for almost 15 minutes to get to the next exit and found our way to red robin. &nbsp;we were hungry, and at the same time, tried to get to the restaurant before it closes at 10 p.m.we arrived at red robin at 9:50 p.m., and they sat us down right away. &nbsp;my friends ordered the root beer float with unlimited refills, a chicken wrap meal, and an appetizer combo. &nbsp;we were sitting at the dining area, but the waiter let me order from the <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> (8 p.m. to close) menu (thank you raul!), so i got myself a tap miller light and some appetizers. &nbsp;the refills were quick, and they even gave us extra fries to share. &nbsp;i would have to say that the food was ok, but the services were great. &nbsp;if i have the chance, i will definitely come back to this red robin again. &nbsp;oh, chaparral lanes (<a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.chapparral-lanes.com&amp;s=c6b27a13fdb3ea9d6cf2457f57995932fa52941cb8d5c981c9cadd62b83c9135" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chapparral-lanes.com</a>) is nearby!view my other reviews at: &nbsp;<a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fow.ly%2f5mbqa&amp;s=1a10e8d0460f5cb22f27c17d33bf53cdcad8017ac0bf317364b43f74560d8b6f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ow.ly/5mbqa</a>
applebees-san-dimas
well. it's applebees. standard american diet (sad) kid's like it. so that tells you a lot. sometimes i am forced to go here because a friend that lives close by wants a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink. or the nearby wine bar closed and this is open late for some food. i have yet to have any food item wow me. but they do have a <span class="highlighted">happy &nbsp;hour</span> with some discounted drinks and snacks. and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts again at 9 or 10pm for a late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. and they have a weekend <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;so that is a good thing. chips and salsa are not great, but decent enough for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. oh, the last time i was forced to eat there, they had some potato chips that were spiral cut russets with some pico de gallo and cheese dip. that was good with a drink. my friends loved them. &nbsp;and a nice simple caesar salad was safe. potato twisters, pretty good! <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-dimas?select=fdubr5es_kmqkammixr8ia">yelp.com/biz_photos/appl…</a>caesar side salad. safe. of course no anchovies. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-dimas?select=uhcbdtzbix3daibwik0dqg">yelp.com/biz_photos/appl…</a>blackened chicken pasta. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-dimas?select=wmlunxeengkc71sbgpbbuw">yelp.com/biz_photos/appl…</a>
it's an applebee's... you get good cheap food and a full bar! i can't really complain. this location is pretty busy but i've never had a problem with service or the food and they have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials.
this is probably the worst location i have been to. the service was terrible and their drinks are tiny. the waitress told us they were having their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for our drinks and they ended up being full price. my salad was covered in soggy tomatoes and there was barely any of the burnt chicken on it. i will never be back to this applebees!
when i was a kid applebee's was probably my favorite restaurant. i'm <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to report that my tastes have evolved. we had an early dinner here about a week ago on our way to san manuel. fortunately, we arrived right before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended so we were able to order half price appetizers. in fact, that's about all we ordered - boneless buffalo wings, spinach dip, chicken sandwich sliders, french dip sliders and some kind of chili nachos. i'm not sure what the difference is between appetizer sliders and entree sliders because they appeared to be exactly the same and even came with fries. i liked the french dip sliders (not an app) although the bun was too fluffy, but the nachos were yuck. i liked how applebee's puts a little booklet with nutritional information on every table. of course after perusing it, you'll notice that very few dishes have calorie counts under 4 digits. in fact, i noticed that some dishes had like 10,000+ calories and i am hoping that they are indeed some kind of party platter for 100 people. there's a time and a place for chicken fingers and other junk foods and if the mood hits, applebee's is a good place to go, especially with all the deals they have going on now.
i can't speak for other locations; but, my local applebee's is amazing!!! i love coming during their famous <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3pm-6pm and late night at 9pm-closing. i've been going quite often, than normal. in my opinion, the food is great and well prepared, as well as the drinks. i really like the customer service given, even when you're one of the familiar faces or running into a familiar face, i.e customers of mine or old friends from school, it's always a good time!! especially when the bartender and waitress, know you as a &quot;regular&quot; of theirs, makes the experience even better!!all in all, applebee's, san dimas, is very welcoming, clean atmosphere, and very attentive!! i love it there!!! =d
first time at an applebee's ever...the restaurant is about 5 minutes from me which makes it super convenient.came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which means half off drinks &amp; appetizers (except for the appetizer sampler which is $2 off). &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> runs m-f 3-6pm &amp; after 9:00 pm. &nbsp;i don't know if this applies on weekends.the second we walked in the restaurant a friendly young man greeted us and showed us to a booth. &nbsp;he made small talk along the way which was nice.our server came by 5 minutes or so after we sat down to take drink orders. &nbsp;drinks came relatively quickly and then it was time to order an appetizer.our server was friendly, casual, and great. &nbsp;he was very patient and thorough when answering questions.toward the end of the meal the manager came by and cleared our plates (very impressive) and gave us a $5 off coupon for our next visit and a 'very important neighbor card&quot; (essentially a punch card which after 4 more visits will get us a free appetizer and after a total of 10 visits will yield a free entree.the restaurant reminded me a bit of a joe's crab shack, a slapdash collection of objects thrown on the walls, and lots of wood paneling. &nbsp;the restaurant isn't very big but we didn't feel cramped. &nbsp;there is a bar in the center of the restaurant with a flat screen playing sports.the menu--appetizer sample: $10.99 (normally $12.99) chips, artichoke/spinach dip, quesadilla, cheese sticks, and boneless chicken wings. &nbsp;it's served with marinara sauce that was bit runny for my taste, fresh salsa, ranch, and blue cheese. --half rack of baby back ribs. (i don't remember the exact price because we did the 2 for $24 deal). &nbsp;the ribs were good, served with coleslaw, and fries. &nbsp;they also come with another appetizer, i chose onion rings.--9 oz sirloin. &nbsp;perfectly cooked at medium rare. &nbsp;it didn't require any steak sauce. &nbsp;served with veggies &amp; garlic mashed potatoes. &nbsp;($10)--sizzlin apple pie ($5.99). &nbsp;served sizzling in a skillet. delicious. &nbsp;this is sort of a deconstructed apple pie: very little crust--more like a light crumble, plenty of apples, vanilla ice cream, and caramel sauce served on the side.beverages-long island iced tea. &nbsp;(i had 2 for $8) &nbsp;my first time having this cocktail and i found it a bit weak, &nbsp;i didn't taste all of the various liqueurs added into the beverage.--merlot (2 glasses for $6). &nbsp;i didn't order this, but my companion enjoyed it.total bill without tip came to $59.79.the appetizer sampler is huge (i would have been fine just ordering that and drinks). &nbsp;i had lots of good to take home.overall the experience was ok. &nbsp;nothing was spectacular, but i will come back here again.
even though it was a busy saturday night we were seated within 10 minutes and i was relieved since we had our 2 year old with us. we would have liked a booth but wanted to be seated quickly so we went to a table. the tables in the back of the restaurant are really close to one another. i was sitting within inches of another large size family and felt bad when i had to stand in order for their little boy to go to the bathroom. because the tables are so close, it's hard not to feel like you are in the middle of others conversations. they really need to fix their layout or somethin because i can't imagine bringing the rest of my kids or a group of friends here without feeling crammed in. but our visit wasn't all bad. we ordered the pretzel bread and beer cheese for an app and holy sheez it was awesome. for dinner i ordered the goddess salad and it was huge. i was full just eating that and the bread so i boxed up my chicken wrap. my date ordered the shrimp and chicken tequila plate (not sure what it was called exactly) and i tried some and it was great. my son had the mac n cheese (he had just woken up from a nap so we didn't want to give him something adventurous and piss him off) and he ate all of it and it was a pretty big portion. his fries were really salty though. the service here is not excellent but it is pretty damn good considering they were so packed and busy. they have a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal every day and if the manager doesn't come by, you can get 10$ off your next visit. he came by and was very friendly. i even saw him picking up tables and being talkative to the waitstaff.

the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around.. $5 foods drinks for under $4i will be back!!!!!!!!!
sweet waitress, great tempura avocado, potato skins and steak sandwich. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best in town, 430 till 8. &nbsp;very good martinis.
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is one of the best around i believe. the best part is they have some really really good bands play there, and that's when i go.
stopped by for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! sweeeet! awesome drinks at a great price!! $6.00 martinis!! bartenders, t and danny &nbsp;make awesome.... strong!! drinks. they are very attentive. tried the artichoke and chopped chicken salad off of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu... quite tasty! hard to find a place with a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>... this place does the trick!! they have live music too at 9:00. i'll definetly be back!
i've eaten here many times and overall had a pretty good experience. the steaks are great and if they still serve it... add the bacon wrapped shrimp. they are definitely the best item i've had there. i also enjoy having a drink in the bar area during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it's very spacious and the bartenders are great.
we often visit for the weekday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and make a dinner out of the appitizers. we also visit frequently for monday night football. free food, great drinks, prizes, and a fun crowd. if we are lookimng for something a bit healthier, we get the salad bar. we have so many favorite employees, it is hard too pick one. we can recommend jonnie, colleen, yvette, jenny, holden, and danny. these are just the names we remember. the others are good, too.
this is my second time here. first time was for my father in law's birthday (had a blast and the food was great). now i'm meeting up with my husband to watch the game. every monday during football season they offer free <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> hotdogs and chips, plus 1/2 off drinks and appetizers. you can't beat that! so far i've ordered a &nbsp;shrimp cocktail (delicious), fried calamari (i've had better), draft beer, and helped myself to a hot dog (yummy). they also did a raffle which was fun even though we didn't win this time.
ribs were bad. these ribs are the type of ribs that made me think i didn't like ribs for half my life. difficult to eat. definitely needed my knife and the little wipey towel afterwards. these are the type of ribs that my dad would get mad at me for when i was a kid. &quot;if you are gonna leave half the meat on the bones, then no more ribs for you!!&quot; &nbsp;good daddy!! cuz i hate them. they are hard to eat and not worth it!! no more ribs for me until years later as an adult and someone convinced me to try a tender baby back rib. well, it was a trip back to my childhood alright. and my daddy was even there! &nbsp;i glanced nervously at him waiting to be scolded for leaving so much meat on the pork rib bones. but, dammit, it was like crazy glued on there. not tender. the sides were a lightly steamed stalk of broccoli. good in my book since i hate over cooked frozen vegetables. my coleslaw was good. but i prefer classic coleslaw over the the peanut one they have. &nbsp;the tempura avocado was okay. and the chopped salad actually looked really good. but i am giving a couple of stars for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (half off drinks and free appetizers) and the fun saturdays i have had there when a band plays in the bar. now i have never seen <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> poppin and hoppin, but if you want a cheap drink and some snackies, its good. fridays and saturday nights in the bar can get packed when a good band is playing. as the prior reviewer stated, the service was good. i would give 2.5 stars if i could but i am rounding up cuz the service was nice and friendly.
awesome food, great service, and lots of fun!i had the salad bar, which was stocked with everything i could have wanted, and the smothered blue steak topped with blue cheese, mushrooms, and onions. &nbsp;it was cooked to perfection. &nbsp;i couldn't even order dessert i was so stuffed. &nbsp;our waitress was friendly and on top of it. &nbsp;after dinner, we moved to the bar where there was a band playing. &nbsp;they were so good, we ended up staying the rest of the night. &nbsp;i had so much fun!also, while i was there, i noticed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials: &nbsp;half off all liquer!?!?! &nbsp;i will definately be coming back for that...
i do like the customer service i get from there. i would only caution that when you order steak, and order it medium well or medium that you cut into the meat before you eat it. reason for this is because this place is dim already but i did have the experience of a bloody steak when i asked for it to be medium cooked. however aside from that, they have no problem taking it back and cooking you up a fresh piece. also they are friendly there for this past experience. good choice of beers and the well drinks are well priced during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but beware. they use well liquors which means that if you drink 4 cosmo's and 3 vodka cranberries, you will wake up with a headache the following morning lol.
came here friday night for drinks and steak. &nbsp;walked into the restaurant and was overwhelmed by the bathroom stench. &nbsp;turns out the bathrooms are located right where the maitre'd stands, by the entrance. &nbsp;the smell turned my stomach. &nbsp;hubby didn't smell it, but i have a keener sense of smell than he does. &nbsp;anyway, i had the all you can eat soup + salad bar. &nbsp;eh. &nbsp;salad bar is ok, not bad. &nbsp;but i can get the same stuff at sizzler for half the price. &nbsp;hubby ordered ny steak and baked potato. &nbsp;steak was perfectly cooked to order and was delicious. &nbsp;we also had fried calamari for appetizer - delicious with the horseradish and marinara sauce. &nbsp;drinks are half off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but only if you're in the bar. &nbsp;i had a margarita, hubby had a beer. &nbsp;paid full price because we were sitting in the dining area. &nbsp;overall, it was a-ok. &nbsp;bill came out to $70+ plus tip. &nbsp;i'd go again, but will hold my breath as i enter as to not smell the stinky bathrooms. &nbsp;staff was very pleasant, parking is easy.
the lounge has great entertainment and a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> no one can compete against. however the biggest issue in the lounge area is the seating. due to a recent pattern the seats in the lounge area are being mostly occupied by band members and their immediate families and friends. i have arrived at the restaurant at least 2 1/2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> before the band starts to see no tables available. and when there is a table available you will see one or two people holding a table that seats 10-12 people. yet the restaurant claims to have a no reservation policy. this is a policy i am not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about. the restaurant and it's management might as well reserve the lounge area for the band and its family members. perhaps a private reservation?either change your current reservation policy or continue to lose customers who were instrumental in your continued success.as a local of this establishment and someone that was a frequent patron i will go elsewhere and join others who already have left because of this.

worst experience i've had here for a sunday night. tried to watch sunday night football and the tv was changed at the bar for one couple that knew the manager. multiple customers asked to have it put on football to no avail. staff was great but i guess you need to know the manager to watch what you want at the bar. i have had hit and miss experiences here that i think i won't ever be back. very disappointed and cannot believe one couple was given special privileges just for knowing the manager. food is great, staff is great but it was overall a bad experience especially since the specials/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was catered around football.
i go here all the time.it's a bar that i can walk to from my place, they typically pour generously, and the a lot of the food on the menu is really quite tasty. (try the pulled pork sliders, the hangover burger, and the apple salad)the service is usually o.k. the front of the house management seems to have a hole in it somewhere, but, overall, the service is pretty darn good.<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> are good, too. tequila tuesday and wing wednesday are a good time. i almost forgot to mention the hoot that is known as trivia night on tuesdays... you'll never win though, because there is a team of, what seems to be, four older super-geniuses that seems to win every time i go.plus, big screens to watch the lakers lose these past two seasons they've been open have been good, too. i can cry after each game over a generously pungent jack&amp;coke. &nbsp;that is all!
beware of the tap takeover, if it is a thirsty thursday &nbsp;and tap takeover you will not get <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> discount on tap take over beers , even though the flyers all over the inside says 2 dollars off all drinks, i even pointed out out to who i thought the owner was and he told me not on tap takeover even though i asked him the sign right in front of us that said all drinks. i've had it with this place, all the bad reviews are about service. &nbsp;and from my experience even the owner does not care about the customers concerns.we waited over 10 minutes to get just drinks and saw others in the same situation. there is no communication going on in this restaurant. we will be going else where from now on. they also rarely get what you ordered right on your tab.

i don't know if they have new owners or what but i thoroughly enjoyed my kobe beef sliders for $5 and lollipops (chicken wings with a sweet sauce) during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> the other day. &nbsp;it is pricy but you are paying for prime steak not choice. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is best in the evening and their bar is unreal.... johnny walker gold?? hello, winning!
just had lunch with my friend jacqueleen and we had a pleasant time. pedro and miguel were our servers and did a phenomenal job. i love the ambience of this place. i also just found out they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4 to 8pm. $5.50 for all appetizers and $3.00 on selected wines. and to top it off they have dancing fridays and saturday nights :)
let me start by saying this place has gone through many changes mostly positive. they have always been known for their steaks which are delicious and the quiet ambiance. &nbsp;after adding a pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu they started to receive a more lively crowd especially on the weekends. i have been coming to this location since it was the velvet turtle ...i'm aging myself. &nbsp;to tell the truth there are not many true steakhouses nearby. looking back at the reviews regarding treatment to customers, i have never been spoken to in a ill manner at this restaurant. &nbsp;if &nbsp;anything the professionalism this establishment provides lacks elsewhere. will i give them 5 stars no, only because there is always room for improvement, that being said i will continue to frequent this establishment . good food, cordial staff, and overall great service keeps me coming back
this place is great!!! the service is fantastic. i have never been to a place that every single person there makes you feel like you are their only table. they are all very professional and they know the menu very well. all of the servers have been well trained. i have not only eaten in the restaurant, but also have had after work drinks at the bar. there is a tender there by the name of nick. he might be one of the best drink mixers i have encountered outside of big clubs in la. i was there with my gf and she wasn't sure what she was in the mood for, so he said let me make you something and if you don't like it the next drink is on me. he made her some sort of concoction and served it to her. she was amazed! when she asked what it was called, he had no name for it. it was something that he created himself. i thought that was great. back to the food. i have been here many times now and have almost tried everything on the menu. the steaks are fantastic. i prefer the baseball cut or the rib-eye. i am not a big cooked fish guy so i didn't care for the salmon to much, but for starters i like the calamari. most of the time i start with the fresh ahi. it is so good. not only that but it is half off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i would recommend this place to anyone. covina has bj's and chili's and other restaurants that are cool to hang out and eat with a few drinks. covina lacked a steakhouse. before hamilton's i would have to drive to fullerton or pasadena to get a good steak. it is nice that this quality of food is here in covina. the prices are no different from any other steakhouse i have been too. actually the drinks are cheaper than any steakhouse i have been to. i am glad that blake's is gone and hamilton's is in. although hamilton's is not doing a champagne brunch like blake's did, this place is much much much better than blake's ever was. so go and treat yourself and have a good time.

cool place for lunch specials and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals are good. deals change everyday. waitresses are very nice.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 9 p.m-closing cant beat $3 drinks!
menu says <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts at 7. waitress told us kitchen not open til 7:30. we didn't get our food til almost 8. not a good place for young generation to hang out
great selection of crafted beers. waitresses are very nice and fast working. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials during the week it does get very busy during the weekend but other than that it's great and they &nbsp;also have a touch tunes box and it has a great selection of music to pick from
taco tuesdays is the best deal in town. &nbsp;nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, good bar food (like the nachos and mozzarella sticks, yum!) &nbsp;they have been the location for the san dimas &amp; la verne chamber's hype (helping young professionals excel) program for the past several months and the attendees have enjoyed their time (and drinks!)
best waiter i ever had! he was funny, nice, and actually remembered our order down to every detail! love their 9pm-closing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the food was good too, i esp. liked the burger bun they had. it was pretty empty on a thursday night but if you're looking to just dine out with friends and have a few drinks then i would def. come here.
great &nbsp;sports bar with several large screen tv's. any good sports bar will have different ways of making revenue during main events like a ufc fight. some may charge a small coverage charge after a certain time, so get there early, some places charge a fee to reserve a table, and some places even have a minimum amount to spend per person per <span class="highlighted">hour</span>.the decor is definitely what makes this an awesome sports bar and the game day specials for drinks is the best deal in town. it feels like its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day everyday. good times. the bartender provider excellent service and the food was just above average.i will be here a lot when football season kicks off.
bored? then go to finish line and bet on horse races and order some wings + beer! if you come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (3-7), you can get pitchers for $9 and some bar food for less than 5 bucks. i came here a few times and had a great time. they have satelite wagers for different race tracks, so that's kind of fun. if you just want to kill some time, bet $2 on a horse and maybe you'll win something! so far 2 for 2 for me! randomly bet on a horse and won enough money to pay for my gambling and food! pretty awesome! i would have given this place 5 stars, but if they are busy, you will have to wait quite a long time for your food and for service. overall, cool place to hangout!

this review is only for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.i saw their sign outside saying they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on thursdays, fridays, and saturdays until 8pm (i think) which you normally don't see so of course the hubby and i were very excited to try it out. we went dressed very casually (myself wearing my work clothes and flip flops) and my husband just wearing shirt and jeans. &nbsp;when we first walked in there, it was dark and the first thing we could see was an abandoned hostess desk. we looked around and didn't see anyone so we ventured inside. to the left we saw the bar and headed on over there and sat down (not too much room i might add). &nbsp;just some bar stools and a few areas to lounge. (the crowd at the time looked like desperate guys hoping to score with some after-work <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ladies. where if they didn't succeed, they would just wait for club time.)we ordered a couple of drinks and some guacamole to nosh on. when the guacamole came out, i couldn't find the avocados! it was more of a green tinted salsa. and this cost $5 (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price). ummm...it was not worth it. acapulco <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> guacamole is $5 and is worth every ounce. not this stuff. it was an embarrassment to all guacamoles. as for the drinks, they were weak! my margarita tasted like it was mostly sweet and sour and my husband's mojito tasted like it was made of simple syrup only. we will never come here again.
nice club for the younger crowd nice &nbsp;music patio and scenery. &nbsp;dont try <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> we were on a girlfreinds weekend getaway in the area and went to <span class="highlighted">happy</span> and &nbsp;we were the only people in the place. we orderd shots of tequila and they had no limes. the appetizers &nbsp;tacos were good per my friends. i didnt eat so i cant say! &nbsp;the staff was friendly and accomodataing the bartender gave us a tour of the &nbsp;club and invited ups &nbsp;back that night.
we came here because we were staying at the shilo inn, and this was where the breakfast was served.the breakfast was mediocre: oatmeal, some fruit, sausage, a waffle maker, and bread and bagels. no eggs/omelette option (and i'm big on protein for breakfast, simple carbs will have me hungry in an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>!) so i was very disappointed with that. but then, the chef came out with a heaping plate of eggs! however, he gave it to a man at a table, sat down with him and started chatting. i asked the girl behind the bar if there was a way to get eggs, and i was told &quot;oh no, that man is a personal friend of the chef's.&quot; needless to say, i was not <span class="highlighted">happy</span>.also, there was orange juice that tasted as if it was made from tang, and cranberry juice that had to be powdered as well... it was awful. plus all the glasses were dirty. would not recommend at all.

we came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and we were in the mood for kitsch so the we loved sitting in a refurbished mine cart (circular, with padded seats). appies half off (get the steamed artichokes) as were the drinks. &nbsp;a wonderful view of the 10 freeway. and the 60 in the distances. actually, it was lovely surreal to be floating above the cars, from a glassed in perch. you don't hear any of the traffic noise. &nbsp;it was like having a drink at thunder mountain at disneyland.
only about banquet rooms... christmas party, dj, buffet style food was meh-- pasta something, lettuce something, fruit was good, chicken blah. bar for banquet room strong pours but with such a long line (thirsty crowd) i went downstairs to anthony. yummy pineapple shooters, kamakase, merlot house on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. beautiful views of the city lights, kinda romantic... avoid food, great venue for christmas party. valet!
perfect dining experience if ur out on a date. &nbsp;the atmosphere was great and beat part it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. drinks were cheap. now the bad partmy wife and i ordered our food. salmon and chicken. we was very anxious to eat but once we dug in we found the food was way undercooked. salmon was still ice cold in the middle and my chicken was still bleeding. &nbsp;i called the waitress over and she felt the salmon and first words were omg. i am so sorry &nbsp; then i showed her the chicken and again she said omg. she took both plates back and within 5 minutes brought us new plates. never before have i seen fish cooked so quickly nor chickens. but nonetheless we just told her to put it in togo boxes. &nbsp;very upsetting experience. &nbsp;for the amount of money spent on each dish u would expect cooked food even if the portions were minuet. &nbsp;personally i would not come back nor say it was a good spot. &nbsp;just make sure too check ur food before eating as this could happen to u.
we have been several times...before the new manager came there were several problems...most of which seem to have been resolved (even the employees seem happier). &nbsp;they have a very good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which can be enjoyed until 6:30pm. &nbsp;the atmosphere is very comfortable. &nbsp;the view is one of the best. &nbsp;we have never felt rushed. &nbsp;our waitress, that we now request (katherine r.) is a gem. &nbsp;the meals can be a little pricey but you are at a higher end restaurant not a cafe or grill type. &nbsp;now for picky picky...i don't understand why restaurants of this caliber cannot offer a baked potato without charging..or at least charging a reasonable price they are just too expensive. &nbsp;also the salad bar could use some upgrading. &nbsp;really picky, no reason to have fake bacon bits for your salad and baked potatoes. &nbsp;overall a very nice and pleasant place to enjoy a relaxing and quiet meal.
i'm pleasantly surprised!!! if you have driven east on the 10 fwy heading east i'm quite sure you have seen that old western building on the top of the hill! &nbsp;well ladies and gentlemen i'm here to tell ya, make a reservation~ you won't regret it! and for all you fellas who want to make an impression on ya lady friend, &nbsp;bring her here for dinner or sunday brunch. &nbsp;it's very quaint, &nbsp;a bit romantic and the staff are very friendly! &nbsp; can't comment on their entrees yet, that will come later. &nbsp;there menu covers just about everything from surf-n-turf to sweet treats. &nbsp;beer, wine and signature drinks. &nbsp;they also have a bar that appreciates us folks who enjoy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4pm-7pm tuesday-friday with appetizers 1/2 off! &nbsp;sunday brunch 9:30am-3pm with 5.00 off if ya get here 10! &nbsp;omg!!! i mean the list goes on and on!!! 10.00 off with ya yelp check-in!! food/drink porn overload~ brandee is the bomb. com! be sure to give her a sweet tip!
to quote &quot;tale of two cities&quot;; this place was the best of times, and the worst of times. &nbsp;having eaten at the various so. cal &quot;hill/view&quot; type restaurants; i.e. oddyssey in granada hills and castaways in burbank i pretty much knew what to expect coming to pomona valley mining co. &nbsp;i had eaten here before, but many, many years ago. &nbsp;you come for the view not necessarily the food, and you know the food will be ok, not great, but decent. &nbsp;the first half of the evening was actually really good and the party of 7 was generally <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the quality of food, the portion sizes and the service of our waitress. &nbsp;three of us had the filet and lobster and were quite surprised on the size of the lobster tails. &nbsp;they were definitely on the large size, which was good. &nbsp;one person had just the lobster tail, one had the ribs and two others had the king crab legs and filet (foreshadow alert!!).the food here was better than the two other locations mentioned above; we had drinks, a bottle of wine, and a few desserts. &nbsp;we spent roughly $500 for all this and left generally pleased with the experience........ &nbsp; &nbsp;but, that is where the two stars come in, and maybe, it should be one star.i will sum this up very quickly: &nbsp;two in the party got very sick a couple <span class="highlighted">hours</span> later. &nbsp;the two that ordered and ate the king crab legs and filet were both very sick later on. &nbsp;when you spend as much as we did for this meal, you certainly don't expect people in your party to get sick, but unfortunately, two people did. &nbsp;we all ate the salad bar, the bread, and shared a couple of the desserts, the people that ate steak and lobster had no issues. &nbsp;since we all ate the same steaks, i can only conclude that the problem was in the crab legs-----beware of the legs......too bad this happened, because aside from two people getting very sick, we had a good meal and a good time.
if i could give this place no stars, i would have done so. &nbsp;horrible food, lousy music &amp; food poisoning to boot! &nbsp;not a way to spend a holiday weekend! when we arrived, the parking lot was nearly empty, which was surprising for a sunday night at 7:00. &nbsp;we went inside, not sure if they were open, but they were, so we were seated. &nbsp;the first negative mark was the country music blasting from the speakers over each table. &nbsp;having to be forced to listen to that garbage is bad enough, but to have bad food on top of it makes it a joke. the menus came and we all kept looking at the 8 items listed wondering if we had been given special menus instead of regular ones. &nbsp;even basic pasta dishes were $25. &nbsp;each steak ($30 minimum) was listed as having some sort of sauce, cheese slices, bacon, or mushroom goop on it. &nbsp;right away that told me to be careful. &nbsp;any &quot;steakhouse&quot; that has to disguise their meat with sauces or cheese simply means they are giving you low-grade products that wouldn't taste good on their own. i ordered the small prime rib, rare. &nbsp;what i got was a large prime rib, well-done. &nbsp;the as-jus was fresh out of a bag, warm water added, meaning salty and disgusting. &nbsp;the potatoes on my plate literally collapsed within themselves, exposing potato powder that hadn't been mixed correctly. &nbsp;i pointed this out to the server who asked if i wanted more. &nbsp;more instant potatoes on my $30 plate, you mean? &nbsp;no thanks! i had seafood salad &amp; clam chowder from the salad bar and surprisingly the clam chowder was pretty good. &nbsp;the cheese bread they brought to the table could have been wrung out, it was so greasy, but i guess that is why it was tasty too. we left the restaurant not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with going there, but knowing it is a place to surely be avoided from here on out. &nbsp;however, the best was yet to come for me as three <span class="highlighted">hours</span> later i was doubled over with food poisoning which was determined to have possibly come from the seafood salad. &nbsp;i was the only member of the party to have eaten it &amp; the only one to be sick, even though my boyfriend was a bit nauseous for awhile after leaving the restaurant. &nbsp; do not visit this place. &nbsp;sure it has a view, but in the end, you can save yourself $30 a plate &amp; just go to a much nicer facility that has much better food. &nbsp;i would never recommend this place, to anyone!
fourth-street-mill-la-verne
server was very friendly, atmosphere was very nice in evening, the remodel looks great! &nbsp;not so stoked about early <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and prices. &nbsp;like others mentioned $8 for fries? &nbsp;i'd say prices are comparable to chases , i'll stop by for a few drinks and head over to wings, lordsburg or back abbey to eat.
location is great, construction and remodel was superb, it's a beautiful building. i was really excited to try this place. great place to drink. the beer selection was well thought out and deep. 12 taps to choose from and they're all worthy. the food was very good but my gripe is just the same as always, not enough. way too expensive for the servings. lettuce is cheap, fill the plate. i had an open faced sandwich with nothing on the side. my wife had a tiny salad. the kids had the antipasto which could have been much better if not minimized to salami olives cheese and lettuce. they need to learn what shoestring french fries really are and not charge $8 for a small scoop. a lot more generous with the portions, expand the menu, add a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, otherwise we'd rather drop this kind of change at the original chase's.
