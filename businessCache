in the words of toby keith &quot;i love this bar!&quot; <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-7pm $1.75 beers, but if you miss <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> don't fret, domestic beers are only $2.25 all the time! i highly recommend stopping in on wednesdays where you get an 8 oz steak, baked potato, green beans and a salad for $10! super friendly bar staff, pool table, juke box = good times!

i love their lunch and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials! great food and great customer service!one of my favorite restaurants.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> m-f till 8pm only in bar. would have given 5 stars but the hostess didn't share there was a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sat us in the restaurant :/ now we know!
bomb shrimp cocktails!! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> lunch special is the best! all for 10$!! with a beer or margarita!
shrimp cocktail is pretty good &amp; mango margarita. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is til 8pm for the drinks. pretty good deal on drinks here. its by the 60 freeway off mountain ave.
great for <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>....prices are very reasonable and food portions are quiet large. great atmosphere for everyone....sit by the bar section to enjoy a great time!
wow! 9.99 for two huge ceviche tostadas and a margarita on the rocks for lunch. &nbsp;for what your getting it makes life sensational!ramon the bartender whips up the most delish &nbsp;drinks and is very accommodating. &nbsp;come here to unwind after work and enjoy the amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
food was phenomenal. it comes with soup and chips and salsa. they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu under $10 and it includes a drink. atmosphere was great as well, &nbsp;i really enjoyed how clean and professional the restaurant was. my only complaint is that the service is slow to bring items you are looking for.
this place is amazing! &nbsp;the cadillac margaritas are to die for seriously! &nbsp;the service is excellent and the food is delicious. &nbsp;the lunch special and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are so amazing, i can't even believe that they are making money. &nbsp;great job!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is great!! customer service can be be really good or really bad. food is grey though try the nachos, they're great for a big group (sharing's caring). i got the ceviche which is $6.50 huge portion!!! couldn't even finish it all.
good seafood. grilled shrimp was awesome, so was the bacon wrapped shrimp. fish was a little salty but nothing a little lime cannot fix. we went on a weekday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so it was a bit noisy. perhaps restaurant might consider seating people away from the party goers. will definitely go back.
the food here is delicious and the service is great. my experiences here have me feeling like family. my food always has a great home cooked taste with the art of presentation and plating that make all the difference. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> has a great selection of apps and drinks monday thru thursday 11am-8pm, and friday 10am-6pm. sundays they have live music.in all my experiences with el pescador this place has been lively during the day and especially at night.
i love this place....been here a couple of times before. i love their ceviche de camaron!! yum...i love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> til 8pm every weekday except friday!!! service is okay...they can be better but very friendly. great place to watch sports and have a couple of drinks with your friends.
so they seat us in the main dining area. we came here for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks because the deals are really good. so our group all orders several drinks each. the waitress then informs us that they won't split the check. ok whatever, one of us has to take all the bill. so the bill comes and it is way more then it should be. they charged us full price. it turns out we weren't in the vip section, but in a section where <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> doesn't apply. i tell her we didn't know, they just sat us here. she says sorry and walks away. we tell the cashier and the waitress comes back. i think they should of given us the special as first timers we didn't know.
the food here is pretty good depending on what you order. service has always been good.i also love the drinks however they are a bit inconsistent sometimes.. &nbsp;i've had the best drinks there and then gone back and gotten average drinks. &nbsp;i guess it depends who's working at the bar. &nbsp;good micheladas. &nbsp;good mexican cocktails. &nbsp;decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
my friends brought me here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a wednesday afternoon... 2.75$ margaritas!! nice and strong, too! i noticed previous reviews slamming this place hard, so i was leary of their quality from the get go.we started with some buffalo wings and guacamole. &nbsp;both were well presented, the buffalo wings were delicious and the guacamole was fresh and flavorful. &nbsp;i would have enjoyed more heat in my guacamole but it was alright.for entrees, we had the aguas chile, which is shrimp cooked with lemon...very tasty! plump, succulent shrimp with vibrant, fresh flavors...very nice!i had the skirt steak with beans and rice. &nbsp;the steak was cooked extra thin &amp; grilled very nicely. &nbsp;the meat was nice and tender.the shrimp ceviche was loaded with fresh plump shrimp, cilantro, red onion and avocado...all served atop a crispy thin tostada. &nbsp;squeezed a few limes and chile on top and it was sheer perfection!overall, i had an excellent experience...and my friends, both i might add, are mexicans, thought it was very authentic, fresh and flavorful!i would definitely come back, especially for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!<span class="highlighted">happy</span> eats!
this el pescador mexican grill was very impressive. &nbsp;i've been to several other el pescador so i decided to come to this one. &nbsp;as always, the food was delicious!!!!i love the new decor they have on this location. best part, new &quot;bar&quot; area with a bunch of exotic drinks. &nbsp;perfect place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i highly recommend it. lastly, very affordable.
i really wanted to like this place. they have some decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, and that's about where it stops for me. i ordered two fish tacos with no onions or cilantro, which the waitress repeated back about 3 times, so i know it probably wasn't her fault but it came out loaded with onions and cilantro. it took about her 10 minutes for her to return to our table by which point my boyfriend was already done with his food. she took my plate back and returned me with what i thought would be a new plate in about 5 minutes and when i took the first bite i was pretty certain they used the same fish from my old place because it was cold and soggy. i didn't even finish it. sill got charged for it. i will tell everyone to avoid this place.
this place is awesome. my wife (who has lived in chino for over 20 years was telling me how no business ever survived this location ... according to her, it had been several different restaurants before el pescador took over some years ago. so we never went. about a month or so ago we decided just to check it out. wow ... this place is off the hook! the margaritas are rocking (they have the biggest selection of tequila i have ever seen at a local business), the food is solid (i love the fish tacos, or the carnitas) . and they have pretty decent flan. we've been back a couple times since (icing on the cake is they have deals on <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restaurant.com</a>), and will keep going. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a must!
came here on a random weekday afternoon and it was the lunch <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.i did the drink and meal for 7.99 option and was satisfied.the chips and salsa were bangin' and our service was great.i didn't have to ask our server for a refill once on chips or for our drinks.for my meal option i chose the cheese enchiladas. they came and they were tasty, but nothing really fabulous.the guacamole tasted like it was packaged, sad.the beans were good but the rice was disappointing.i was surprised too because i was hung over and usually everything tastes way better when you're hung over.seeing as that the food was just alright, i'm not sure if i'll make it a point to come back. but hey, if i end up there again somehow.. i wouldn't be upset about it.

i love this place! i'm not much for hookah, but the food is delicious and reasonably priced. sit in the patio area.... there is a beautiful fountain and you get a front row to the trains passing by! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on drinks can't be beat(wine $3) and done forget the bread pudding dessert. i mean before this place i've never even eaten bread pudding but omg. it's to die for here!
found this place when i was looking for a good hookah/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> location for after work. the only thing better than the hookah and drinks was the delicious food. i suggest the chicken kabobs. they were full of flavor and not too pricey.
this was our first time going tonight. some of our friends recommended this place, so we thought we would give it a try. we were really surprised by their hookah which is good quality, and just really a nice smooth taste. we had the watermelon and peach flavor hookah. some of our other party had watermelon and mint which was tasteful, however for me i prefer the watermelon and peach. we didn't try their food, because we stopped at dave and busters first, so there was no need, however will return back for food another time, that simply was not the mission tonight.we sat outside, and the patio area was nice and cool. the atmosphere was perfect and the dj (boss) totally revved it up, and of course we partied. we created our own dance area, that's how we like to party, and we had a great time. there were big screens outside, however no one was really watching, the dj had our full attention.now, yes there is the metro link right there, however maybe because of the time, it was late, it only passed by once that i noticed, and the dj was playing his music so we were not disturbed by the train. the drinks were average price for what we are accustomed to paying outside of a &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; price, and honestly they were good, so no complaints. the service was on top of everything, and was very accommodating. plenty of parking available and easy to find location. not sure if i would venture here in the day, but will find out because of business i will return in the day, and update if any change in view. i didn't give it a 5, because i did not try the food, so i can only write about my experience with what i tried. just a side note, advertisement states they close at 2am, however depending on amount of people may close at 12am or so.
my girlfriend and i came here for the first time 2 nights ago to give it a try since we were in the mood to try something new and have driven passed this place on a daily basis since we live around the corner. we were a bit weary at first glance since it didn't appear busy but after walking in the restaurant is very nice inside and also offers an outside patio with a projector to watch the games. additionally they offer hooka outside as well which i thought was pretty cool even though we didn't have any. the outside is a good size and offers various tables and booths for various size parties ...it was fairly slow when we went so it's hard to say how it is outside when busy with people smoking hooka but the ambiance outside is nice with a waterfall wall in the background but be prepared for random loud horns from the trains as they go by since they pass by just on the other side of the patio. although the trains were quite loud and scared us unexpectedly it is beyond the control of the restaurant and staff and thus does not effect the quality of the service and food.  &nbsp; &nbsp; we started with spicy hummus which was amazing and they give you a generous portion with plenty of warm pita bread. for dinner we shared the &quot;choose 3&quot; kabobs which come with rice and veggies that are absolutely delicious!!! we chose the filet mignon and the chicken (which came with an amazing garlic salt pur&eacute;e type sauce on the side) this was plenty of food for the 2 of us to share but we also got an additional side of rice because it was that tasty. lastly we finished off with the creme br&ucirc;l&eacute;e which was also very tasty! next time we want to try their bread pudding that comes with a scoop of ice cream too cause other reviewers say it's amazing. i don't remember the name of our server but he was amazing as well! although it wasn't busy or packed in there we enjoyed every bit of it and would recommend the food to anyone. we will be back and maybe to try their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as well!
hidden gem! after antique shopping in the area, my wife wanted some good (healthy) food other than the yelp listings of mexican, chinese, burgers or other fast food that seemed to dominate. &nbsp;so at first sight of the place, we both said &quot;there's nothing here&quot;. &nbsp;but the building looked nice and clean from the outside and it was next door to the metrolink train station. well let me tell you, it was delicious!. we ordered the chicken kabob plate and the caramelized roasted salmon, and both did not disappoint in terms of presentation, portion and most of all - taste! the spicy hummus was a little spiceless, but tasted fresh. &nbsp;ended with a dessert we never tried before called kafne, which can only be described as baked cheese with lightly sweetened bread crumbs. they give you a spoon but use a knife to cut the somewhat chewy but not so sweet dessert. &nbsp;the waitress was very friendly and attentive. couldn't believe the place is open for breakfast and as late as 2:00 a.m. on the weekends. &nbsp;very clean with outdoor covered patio, although inside is nicer. the trains going by felt like you were in a travel destination somewhere in the world. we were there on a sunday about 4:00 p.m. so we owned the place and had to ask if it was open. the prices were very fair and they told us about the sunday brunch from 10 - 2 for about $14 and served with mimosas. &nbsp;also mentioned <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> m-f 3 - 7. &nbsp;very good for a just opened restaurant. will definitely be back whenever we're in the area (antique shopping) since we live a little far. &nbsp;keep up the good work and food guys! thanks,<span class="highlighted">happy</span> first timer.

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> = bomb
ordered mushroom and zucchini appetizer and it was very fresh and hot! the wings were the same and of course their homemade chips are always super good!! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! totally recommend this place!
i came here after work. love their mango habienaro, chipotle bbq, and honey bbq wings. we also shared chicken bruschetta, which was rather tasty. i must say, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is cheap.
uncrowded and that was a plus during lunch <span class="highlighted">hours</span>! service was fast and they have a good draft beer selection. various flavors for wings and surprisingly the sriracha lime was the best! i love spicy. they could add a bit more sauce onto to the wings - a lil stingy but still good. &nbsp;didn't make it to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> -bummer, but aside from their 3-6 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tues. - fri. they have all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sun and mon. so i'll be back!
there used to be more food options but they redid the menu a while back and our favorite item is gone. the food is okay, especially if you are going there for wings. they also have good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials and have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day sunday and monday.
love this place great wings!...but they used to have the chicken strips on their sunday and monday all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and not anymore! ended up paying double the price as usual. and the waitress brought us the wrong beers.
this place is where it's at for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials and good food. granted i'm pretty loyal to the chicken nachos and jalape&ntilde;o poppers but i've tried a few other items on the menu and i haven't been disappointed yet. sunday and monday is all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! me and my bf usually stop by here every other week and it always hits the spot. they have a wide selection of beers on tap and the service is always fast and friendly.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is where its at!with hardly any space for a stack of napkins a group of 4 can fill a table with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials including drinks for around $80. you pay for what you get and $80 will get you &nbsp;plenty. the food is great, i normally stick to wings and appetizers. &nbsp;like any wing flavors at any wing dealer stick to the wet ones. as far as appetizers go try as many as you can there all delicious. service is great and the atmosphere is friendly. proud to be a wingnuts fan!
i've officially changed my mind about this place. awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! im in love with the honey bbq wings. they're a little spicy but awesome! i'm a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> <span class="highlighted">happy</span> girl today!
one of my favorite places! but was disappointed today after finding out they took out their amazing chicken strips off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu :( however they have a buy an entree get one free soooo that's still good :) aside from that the food is def good!
place has bomb flavors. love the variety. better then wild wings. they also have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day sunday. perfect for sports. the ribs are fall off the bone good. mango habenerio is the best
great beer variety glad they have darker beers, great sundays all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and most if not all football games on tv's. 1/2 all appetizers
good food kinda high on prices and for beer too had a sam adams small glass. nearly 8 dollars. we were not advised anything on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the burger was small that the bun engulfed the whole patty. small portion of chips and too much lettuce. will not return.
i'm nuts about wings, therefore this place is a must for that first timers. &nbsp;good flavors and variety of meats to choose from, and not just nuts, i mean wings... tip: go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and you won't disappoint your wallet. &nbsp;overall, it depends solely on you to judge this place around pomona-claremont-monclair.ambiance 4.4flavor 4.5presentation 4.3service 4.3price 4.3grade: 4.36
went on a weeknight right before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> rush. conveniently located rt off the fwy in a strip mall area. the restaraunt is not as big as buffalo wild wings which might be good for those that enjoy a smaller eatery. ended up having a yummy chicken salad and a cold one. rtn visit only if in the area.
i frequent this restaurant with my family at least one a week. they have great all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> offerings on sundays and their menu has a great variety of food other than wings. the staff is very nice and always friendly especially carlos, doug, liz and edgar. i recommend their wings over bww any day.
their sunday breakfast menu is huge. i had the chicken and waffles. so good. too much food. came with two waffles,fried chicken and potatoes. i love their bloody mary too. we come about once a month for all day sunday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. have never been disappointed .
i liked this place for there beer on tap, extra tasty hot wings and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. at first i wanted buffalo wild wings &nbsp;but didn't want to drive or deal with the large crowds or wait for a table. &nbsp;i decided to try the local wingnut spot and was very <span class="highlighted">happy</span> i did. they have friendly service and had plenty of seating to watch a game. their &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials were pretty good and the bar was ice cold. perhaps their only draw back would be their tv's. they were ok but didn't seem have super high definition which is a huge plus when watching a sports game. &nbsp;all in all i had a great time at wingnuts and would definalty go back.
awesome!!!! stopped here on a whim and what a great experience. food is amazing and prices are great. we have made another trip back even though a little out of our way. ant wait to go back again!!!!!! not sure about the bad reviews on here. i thought everything was delicious, well priced, great service, and a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!
my only complaint is that one of the times i went, the power went out on the whole block. we were still there for about 30 mins after the power went out, and the staff wouldn't let us leave because they couldnt remember how many beers we ordered, therefore wouldnt give us our bill. big turn off. i like their food, &amp; they usually have good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals, but i will never go there again because of that one incident. i prefer bww anyways :)
what the heck?! we loved this location, we looked forward to our <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> here, with wings, they removed them from the specials. then they had 'strips' to replace those and now, those are gone too! honestly if you are a wing place and you don't put wings or strips on special then why would you eat here? now the only good &nbsp;thing left is the staff!
general-only went there for lunch. they have a killer lunch deal from 11a-3p which is buy 2 drinks and buy one entree, get the 2nd entree free. so my bro or co-worker and i *i work in ontario* gets a 20 pce wing platter or the wing and rib platter. going with 3 folks? no problem, just order a beer for the 4th drink and get 2 entrees free. this is a steal. price-very cheap with the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal. $10 per personbut without the deal it's easily$15-$20 but keep in mind, im a fatass.drinks-many many many beers on tap and bottles. also has a wine. full on bar with tv's.food quality-it appears to be very good, but everything i get is deep fried so i wouldn't really know.food portions-big!!! some of the wings rival kfc legs...food taste-has about 40 different type of chicken wing flavors and about 12 rib flavors. the bbq mac salad is good. but i recommend getting ranch sauce. the best flavors are honey bbq, lemon pepper and scheswan. the diablo is spicy as hell...ambiance/environment-since i always went there for lunch, you have everyday type of folks who are eating lunch on their breaks. otherwise it's like a sports bar. kinda like hooters except the waitresses were fat, but, they were still very kind.service-hit and miss. depends on the waitress. overall-i go there 3x per week so we got to know the regular workers there. the food is cheap because of the deal and you get full as hell. if you are a light eater, you can get 3 people full for about 20 bucks and eat like no tomorow. pros-the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal. great food. great variety. lots of parking and it's never packed during the daycons-the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> will stop and i will feel ripped off if paid full price
this was my first time going here today and to be honest even with the price being more than reasonable i thought their wings were still shitty. i felt the sauces were generic and not really flavorful at all. this place should have a way better <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> especially with the food being as plain as it is. they need to reconsider the way they cook there wings( even if there is 3 dozen flavors or so) and look on getting people a cheaper buzz because thats the only way to enjoy it.
i went here last week to watch the usc game with my dad and bf. go trojans!!!! ... that makes two times at this location and it gives me a decent idea of the place. parking: huge lot!service: deserves a 5/5 star. this is the only reason why i keep coming back to this spot. service has always been on point. the waiter and waitress i had were both courteous, quick, always refilled our water and came around pretty often. food:one word: subpar. +the jalepeno popper: pretty yummy!+<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and daily specials: great deals-the wings: have gotten pretty down hill over the years, they're dry and do not have much flavors. just ehhhh.... i would only come back on wednesday when the wings are on specials, and during office <span class="highlighted">hours</span> for cheap drinks! but i really hope they can bring up the quality of their wings to bring it up to par.
came to wingnuts for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and they have some pretty sweet deals, half off all appetizers, and $5.50 for a 23 oz imported or premium brews, $3.75 for domestic beers. i had to go with the sam adams cherry wheat beer which was great, sweet but not to feminine. &nbsp;and we split a surf and turf appetizers lemon pepper shrimp, about 8 of them pretty good a little to lemony tasting, and 4 buffalo chicken strips, that i enjoyed, and it came with blue cheese dressing, it was $9.80 but because of hh it only cost me $4.90. go in for hh, some great deals.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the worse time to go during weekends. service slow, not attentive, food slow to come. basically order drink and u can get any appetizer 1/2 off. we ordered bbq ribs and it came with the propeller chips. we were not told that and ordered side of propeller chips. whole table filled with chips! wish server could have been nicer to tell us that. ribs was too salty. &nbsp;ordered mini dogs and it was salty too, although the dog itself is juicy once you remove the fried skin. we never got refills, had to ask for it, and figured we should leave b/f having to wait forever for wings. what a nut we were for coming here, and left w/o any wings.
came here with my nursing girls after a dreadful class and it was just what we needed. we came during 65 cent wings wednesday and i got 6 chipotle bbq wings and 6 pomegranate wings. they also came with ranch, celery, and potato chips, which we weren't aware of until the order came. you also had to order a beverage to get the 65 cent wings, and water didn't count. i'm not a fan of the chips because they were way too salty. the wings themselves were not too bad, but they weren't amazing either.wingnuts is a great place to come and socialize. it's probably packed during big games and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i would say that it's a nice kickback place. but i don't know if i would come back anytime soon.
i had just got into town on a sunday night and was starving, when i saw the &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day today&quot; banner on the building. what an awesome way to promote yourselves. that was enough to stop the search immediately for me, and pull my <span class="highlighted">happy</span> ass in for some chicken wings. when i first walked in, i immediately fought the urge to groan and shake my head. i don't know why every goddamn chicken wing place has to go with the whole aviation/plane theme (yeah, i get it. planes have wings, lolz) and it's just ridiculously cliche by now. oh well, i guess it's the &quot;clever&quot; new thing these days, like how sushi places are all naming their rolls the &quot;booty booty super dui 3 am pile-up with a transvestite&quot; or whatever retarded shit they can come up with. anyway, appetizers were half off, so i ordered the buffalo chicken nachos to start. they were pretty damn good, and got us full for $5 before our wings came out. seriously, as soon as the waitress brought out our wings, we packed them up, took them back to the hotel. so, hell yeah for chicken wings for breakfast the next morning!way better than wingstop, and i might have to make another trip to hooters for comparison. way better prices/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> than hooters offers, and i'd definitely be returning if wingnuts were to build a location in fresno.
for the wing connoisseur this place slams buffalo wild wings. lemon pepper (dry rub) deserves 5 stars, service is a hit or miss and that is why i down graded from giving 4 stars. a must try are the potato chips they give instead of fries which make a close 2nd to the l&amp;p wings. ask for a side of bbq sauce and dive them bad boys homemade chips into it and it's aaaammmmaaaazzzing! on sunday's it's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day and appetizers are half off. stay away from the chicken nachos because they are chunks of meat on some chips with some cheese aka wack! but look here's the bottom line if you want a good variety of meaty bone wings, some decent tv's, beer on tap with no big crowds... then this is a spot to give a try. been back 3 times and i've come out a fluffy, <span class="highlighted">happy</span> camper!
as the name suggest, wingnuts has great wings.i've come here quite a few times before and it always is my go-to spot for wings and a tall glass of guinness. they have lots of beer to choose from (like 20+ on tap) and have about 20-30 flavors of wings and they change it up every so often. my favorite used to be tequila but they got rid of it.. now i guess it's the mango habanero. the service is usually pretty spot on and the tables are big and comfortable. parking sort of sucks though but it's manageable. i never come here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because i heard it gets crazy so i can't comment on that, but i can say that service during normal <span class="highlighted">hours</span> is great. i would recommend this place to anyone, but it can get a little pricey so a star knocked off for that. overall i keep comin' back.
i really don't want to like wingnuts. i've been there twice and both times have left with a similar feeling. considering the location, decor, and food quality, i expect it to be really cheap. it's not. in fact, the food is sort of expensive and doesn't taste good. i've eaten the chicken strips with a couple different sauces (they have a lot of sauce choices) and the buffalo chicken wrap. the strips were okay. the buffalo wrap was like someone made a paste out of chicken and blue cheese dressing and coleslaw and stuffed it in a tortilla. that's not a wrap! yuck.but, the reason i keep going back is because the beer list is pretty nice. while it's not cheap, i've paid more than $8 for 22oz of big daddy ipa (not easy to find around here!) plenty of times. there are lots of beers you don't see often, and they come in two sizes. i do like places that wil give me a big beer.they have daily specials (i dont know them all): <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day sunday and monday to save a few dollars on beers, 50 cent wings on wednesday, buy dinner on a friday and night and get discounted tickets to the movie theater across the street. overall, i won't make the mistake of ordering food here again unless the situation is pretty bleak, but i will probably be back for a beer.
i wanted to give it more stars, for the simple fact that it's not a chain (every friggin' wings place out there is part of a chain), but their wings are pretty hit and miss. i like the fact that there is a wide selection of wings. a very large selection in fact. also, i love their mac salad. it's quite tasty. on the other hand... like i said before, their wing flavors are hit and miss. there are some that are crazy good. there are some that are just okay. and there are some that leave you scratching your head, haha. my friends and i decided to make it a tradition to go every wednesday for their wing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, or whatever it's called. we would each get one or two wing flavors, and that way we slowly got to try most of the flavors. now that i moved back to la county i kinda miss it, if only because of the fact that it was a cool tradition to go here and watch an nba or nfl game. that's another thing i like, their prices. well, you have to know what and when to order, but when you squeeze their best deals together you end up saving quite a penny while trying some rather appetizing wings.
the best wings i have found and i have eaten at a lot of wing places. wing nuts is a great local place with sooo many sauce options you really will find your favorite right here. the staff is always friendly and the games are on. the bar is small but still have good choices. sunday or monday you will usually find me there because its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day. doesn't get much better &nbsp;then this.you have about 35 choices of flavors and thats just for the wings. i would highly suggest the strips instead of the wings only because they make their own daily from fresh breasts.i do have to say that the last 2 times i was in the strips were cold and i had to send them back, okay three times but then they were amazing the manager had to make them himself, he is always so helpful. but that aside i will go back again and again. oh ya you must have the blue cheese cole slaw really really the best cole slaw i have ever had

awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> every night!
we go there on a regular basis and always eat at the bar. &nbsp;all the bartenders are super friendly and efficient, &nbsp;especially &nbsp;ryan. we were a little disappointed that they stop <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at 6:00. &nbsp;love the rib sliders which are on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu.
had a midweek <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at the elephant bar and wasn't very impressed. they change their menus and have taken off a lot of the favorites i used to like. ahi tuna is ok maybe even a little tough, the sliders were good flavor but nothing special. i think i'll be trying other restaurants for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for $32 for three people : 4 plates (fish taco, quesadilla, coconut shrimp skewers, lettuce wraps), 1 ice tea, 1 sangria. = <span class="highlighted">happy</span> people! the food is better than the drinks, (altho they are beautifully decorated) so id stick to beers and wines if i were you. (hence my 3 star rating)i like our server ashley, she's sharp and astute. anyhoo, not much you can go to around ie, so elephant bar it is! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is until 7pm!
food is very good!! service is wonderful! great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and watch sports in the bar. &nbsp;i like the cowboy ribeye, and the wife likes the thai high chicken salad. &nbsp;all the food is good. i've never had a bad meal here. this could become a regular place for us.
wow! i had such an awesome experience tonight. &nbsp;not only was the service fast and friendly but thet were spot on. the food &nbsp;came out hot and exact. &nbsp;im a bit picky and they catered to my needs. highly recommend stopping by to get dinner or a drink. &nbsp;awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as well. for sure comming back!
i'm totally impressed with their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;very large menu with great prices. &nbsp;the lettuce wraps and coconut shrimp were great! &nbsp;highly suggest it!service in the bar was great.
i always enjoy the food at elephant bar. &nbsp;we go there at least twice a month. this last visit, there was only one bartender that was excellent but she was running around like crazy. i also feel that the menu is not very good since they changed it. &nbsp;i think they need to advertise their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> more. i am going to have to rethink my dining choices because it is just not the same.
i had a great tasting raspberry lemondrop martini. &nbsp;there was no skimping on the vodka. the bonus was the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price. &nbsp;thanks eb! &nbsp;too bad the tempura salmon roll was awful. &nbsp;it had too much sushi, a few very small pieces of salmon, plenty of tofu, and some avocado half way through. &nbsp;two <span class="highlighted">hours</span> later i have a tummy ache.
last thursday, i called elephant bar at 2p.m. in the afternoon. i spoke with a friendly young lady. the purpose of my call was to see if they could accommodate my handicapped sister and mother. i wanted to take them to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but with my sister's leg brace, and with my 87 year old mom 's limited mobility, i knew we could not sit in the higher bar chairs. the waitress on the phone assured me that elephant bar would accommodate us. when we arrived at elephant bar, the hostess told us we could not sit in the bar. there were only tall stills available. not handicapped assessable. when i asked to speak with a manager, a young man approached me. he said there was room in the bar. when he took me to look at the space it was for three. there were four in our party. he told us elephant bar could not do more. i was upset. we come to elephant a lot for family gatherings. my sister and mother were visibly upset that they were not being considered. we were told we could not order on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. when our waitress appoached, she could see i was shaken.i explained the treatment we received from the male manager. she offered to get another manager. bertha approached our table, and she listened to our concerns.she was respectfull of my elderly mother and handicapped sister. she told us she would accommodate us. i will go back to elephant bar because of bertha, and our thoughtful waitress. please elephant bar talk to bertha about how to treat all people with dignity.please note our final bill was mostly not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items, we just wanted the consideration.
had dinner here with the fiancee last night before the angel's game @ 7.we sat at the bar because i wanted the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. we first started out with a lg newcastle &amp; &nbsp;sm bud lt &amp; sweet potato fries. the fries were ok. kinda too soggy for my taste. i like crispy fries... also too much salt. preferred it salt free.then we order our entrees, oak grilled rainbow trout w/ lobster sauce &amp; braised beef on noodles. both entrees came pretty quickly. i asked for extra sauce because i'm saucy like that... but that made the fish too buttery. the noodle &amp; beef was yummy. only had a chance to steal 2 bites from neil. the noodles were a little doughy for me... would have like it to be thinner pressed.overall...ok.
busy busy!! yummy appetizers the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good deals and great food!!there chicken wraps / sushi rolls / buffalo strips / sweet potato fries/ &nbsp;and margaritas and rum drinks are good. dinners not so good portion is ok. but their plates are kinda of bland!!appetizers are not. at the bar is busy but if u get the seating at the round area of the bar as soon as u sit the bartender sees u and takes ur order i usually order appetizers and drinks so they don't take long to come back and place uour order! delicious recommend it
i usually come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and enjoy their drinks. &nbsp;i hate sitting in the dining room because service is usually slow. &nbsp;but my girl insisted we sit there so we did. (easier to agree than to fight) anyways our server came over with the same old boring spill. blah blah blah. and i thought great i should of sat at the bar. but as she progressed she actually knew what she was talking about. well i was surprised. &nbsp;and she was quite attentive. &nbsp;as soon as my beer was more than half way she asked right away. i would definitely sit back in the dining room as long as liz is my server.
3 star because there was nothing really wrong, but it also did not stand out as anything super special.we walked in early on a wednesday night and where seated right away. we asked about the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials and where told it was only in the bar area. the hostess moved us to the bar without question.we ordered an appetizer and beer, our server came right back with our drinks, and another server came with the appetizer. it did take a bit for our server to get back to us to take our order. but once he did he was very helpful with our questions. the other server brought our food out pretty quickly. both of our dishes where good, well prepared and decent portions.my grip with this place, and others similar to it is the menu. why must it be 10 pages with 15 different ethnic styles?? elephant bar does not fit into a category like diner, asian, french...etc. it is just food on a menu. with that i am in no rush to run back here.
maybe i'm just really lucky cause i've always had good service here!! i especially love their <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, the thai lettuce wraps, the jambalaya, the sweet potato fries, and the kona kooler!! :) my friends and i have had some close intimate dinners as well as some big group events and we have never faced any issues with this place. their waiters and waitresses are really nice. there's never been an exceedingly long wait and i think the prices are fair!!they're willing to substitute your white rice for brown rice, free of charge.. they can split your orders (since the portion is huge) and they dont mind if one person want white rice while the other person wants brown rice :) one time i was being picky and they gave me both in a yin and yang shape!! lol!! i always sit around and chill, they never rush me!! and i love the wanton ice cream thing they give you on/around your birthday!! one time they brought us our two, so we both can have one, even though it was only on one of our birthdays!! haha...overally many good meals and many good memories here!! :)

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> best time
food is bleh. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> doesn't apply in the restaurant (only the bar) yet they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials posted at the tables in the restaurant. go to the bar to get them, though. makes no sense.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around 6pm, but probably won't be back anytime soon. &nbsp;the food is what you'll find in your typical &quot;fancy&quot; mexican restaurants. &nbsp;we basically ordered the entire <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu from taquitos, quesadillas, guacamole, and chicken wings. &nbsp;the food was good, but nothing memorable.our waitress seemed inattentive and forgetful. &nbsp;service was slow when the restaurant wasn't that busy.
good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.i came here for an event and the cantina was poppin. but the bartender was slow and they didn't have enough staff to meet all the demand. they had a dj though which was cool for a restaurant. there's a small dancefloor and a bunch of us were dancing around.
i went there during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and to be honest it was pretty good. the only food that i dislike was the extreme nachos, they tasted kind of raw and it felt like they were overcooked. the place is a little small and like one of the other people that commented on acapulco, it does get a litle noise after the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends!besides that, everything else was ok! the drinks were very intriguing, beer prices were reasonable, but it might a little pricey for the normal joe smoe!! i liked the bonesless wings and the buffalo are pretty good to. there is good entertainment and a good dj jamming on some hits at times...it's an ok place, no the best but for a quick fun night out...not a bad place at all!!
this place is pretty decent for friday night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;they play old school, drinks are cheap and the chips are plentiful. &nbsp;the crowd is a bit older, just like the music, but if you bring your girl its alright, just dont come looking for one or you will be disappointed. &nbsp;oh yeah, and stick to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu or you will be disappointed again.
my wife and i went here on a tuesday night for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sat in the cantina. we had the place to ourselves, they had a table full of chips/salsa that you can help yourself to. we got a few margaritas and appetizers for real cheap and left <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with full bellies for only $25! (including tip)
there is always coupons for acapulco in the paper so thats what brought us in! &nbsp;we had the place to ourselves for the first half of our meal! &nbsp;we sat in the dining room and the waitress was nice enough to let us get the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials which were only supposed to be in the bar! &nbsp;we each got our own meal but one meal easily could have fed all three of us!great value and service-we will be back!
last week i went in on monday with a group of friends, i was informed it was monday margarita and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4-8 at the bar! what can i say best deal by far :) the cocktail server was friendly she upgraded our margaritas for $1 more! i'll definitely be retuning with my friends! the vibe was great and the wings were yummy!
well 2 dollar margarita mondays , and tuesday kids eat free but this place isn't what it use to be food is still good but it's dead and they seem to have lost plenty of cliental , on tv screens tennis and some reality show &nbsp;but i will say this the bartender extremely kind and attentive , and it really is nice to go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after a long day of working , it's just a chill place so that you won't die of boredom , take a friend overall it's ok
this is my go-to spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with my girlfriends, although the last few months i've noticed that the drinks seem a bit less &quot;leaded&quot;, and there is no longer a table with help-yourself chips and salsa, your waitress brings them now....food is generally good, standard mexican fare, with occasional special dishes and all-you-can-eat meals. their shrimp and spinach queso is wonderful most of the time, last week for some reason it was thin and not as dip-like. &nbsp;all in all a decent basic mexican restaurant with reasonable prices.
damn you acapulco for having such a sweet ass <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but such bad service, you seriously broke my heart. came here last night for a bday gathering we had a huge crowd and everyone complained about the service and getting orders mixed up.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 4 to 7, $3.95 for house margaritas, $3 well drinks, half off appetizers, and they also have some free food, such fluatas and beans. the regular price for well drinks is $4.25 and $4.75 for a large bud light, so still not bad prices.the drinks were of course pretty watered down. the food came kind of cold, and it took about 30 minutes to get. our table was not brought any plates, napkins silver ware, love, chips, salsa, or water. i just think the poor waitress was handling too many tables and people and did a horrible job. seriously she straight ignored me a few times, brought me over the wrong drink once, and she forgot to place our order for calamari.if you do decide to come here for hh try the calamari, 3.35 hh price, macho-tizer appetizer. $5.99 hh price, comes with shrimp nachos, fried bananas and pork, 4 buffalo strips, and 4 taquitos.this place is large, but not enough tables, people were desperate for them. they do have a dance floor, a dj, and a failed attempt at karaoke.to top it off i went outside for some air and the douche bouncers at the bar, they set up around 730ish, i got there at 5 said they didn't see me leave the so they needed to see my id, i showed it to them and they didn't believe it was me so i has to show them another id. after they decided i was old enough to be at a bar, they tried to say i had to pay $6, which i of course said i'm not paying anything, i just walked for some air, and they made the first smart decision in their lives and stopped hassling me and let me in.
years ago, i used to meet a friend here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i remember the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals being pretty decent, but their drinks were not very strong. &nbsp;chips are too thin to be really authentic style, but they are better than the typical store bought corn chip trying to pretend to be a tortilla chip and they are warm. this was not really my choice this time as i don't really like chain restaurants, but i was meeting relatives and didn't have a choice. i figured i would play it safe by getting soup and salad combo cuz you can't really screw that up. &nbsp;and i was right, the tortilla soup was good. lots of veggies. &nbsp;and caesar salad with cilantro pepita dressing was good also. my mom said her rice was too bland. &nbsp;my aunt said her enchilada and taco was &quot;okay.&quot; my big annoyance was their nutritional chart that they have at their table. oooh, cool! lets check this out. &nbsp;i'm gonna get something low fat! well, the calorie count is there, but for those that prefer counting fat grams, you are out of luck. it only lists saturated fat for each entree. and i am sure a lot of people don't even realize that and think that is actually the total fat grams. misleading. &nbsp;intentionally, misleading, i am sure. the salsa club starts in the evening. had to fight through all the cha cha chicks and latin music as we left.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in the catina is the bomb! 2-8pm every day $2.99 margaritas and food items!got a free entree up to $12.99 for my bday, so came to try it out. free chips and salsa (choice of 4). $2.99 house margaritas are gigantic, not very strong but still very tasty. ordered a muy grande platter for the entree, which came with shredded beef enchilada, grilled chicken and carnitas. it was a huge plate of good stuff. also ordered canita taquito which came with 3 for $2.99 - 5 stars - must order! the mini tostadita was ok. my waitress was super nice and attentive, refilled my water constantly, and checked back regularly - everytime with a beautiful smile. she was very pretty, very smart and very quick. love this place!
service has gotten really bad and the food is bland. i heard that they have a new manager which absolutely shows. one night we came in, it was empty besides one table but it took the guy (who acted like he was doing us a favor) more than 5 min to seat us. &nbsp;but, we gave it another chance for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and again it was bad. the drinks had very little alcohol and the spinach/shrimp queso was soooo watery it fell off the reheated greasy chips. . all in all i do not think i'll be going back.
well, i have been to this place like two or three times for weekend <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, just drinks and chips with friends. i was there on saturday for no longer than 20 min and parked right in front. the window of my car was broken out at 1:00 in the afternoon and some things were taken. the girl at the front desk said this is a common occurrence. i asked if they had cameras in the parking lot they said no. i just think, if this is such a common thing, they would want to protect their costumers and employees with either cameras or some type of security. dont leave anything in your car here. i wont be back :(

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around :)
2pm-8pm 40% <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, 75 cent taco tuesdays. i only like this place for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food
awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> which is good if your a poor college student
this place is amazing. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, strong drinks, billiards, darts, strong drinks, strong drinks. awesome staff.
this is my go to place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and pool with my number one. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 2-8. the girls there are always nice when serving us. this is the perfect place to sit out on the patio and just drink on a nice day. :]
all i got to say is <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and skeezers...nothing more...nothing less!
their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is pretty legit! &nbsp;taco tuesday= $2.25 beer, $.75 tacos and $2 tequila shots.
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around. 50% all food and drinks. friendly staff, great service. i love this place!
interesting establishment in upland. i came here to meet up with my roommate and her co-worker. they were surprised i had never come here. apparently they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. all i had was a glass of merlot which was about $3.00 so not bad at all. the vibe is really kick back. the service is a little slow but friendly. it's a fun place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...
cool place to watch a game. or shoot some pool. and i like their food and drinks...they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals. this place gets crackin... i love the vibe in there so lively!! easy parking.
this place is filled with older folks. people aren't lying when they say this is the cholo go to spot. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is pretty cool, not gonna lie. the atmosphere is wack. don't take the shots they offer they are watered down and are a waste of money. the waitresses are nice but i can tell they get bored. the music is not always great but i've only come on a wednesday night before with friends. definately not a hot spot as far as i can tell. the wings are decent sized you don't need to order a lot.
first off, i'd like to say that i'd never go to tequila hoppers for anything besides their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday from 2:30-6:30 pm. it is awesome! half off every single possible alcohol selection and food. i recognize the clientele is a little shady and unappealing, so my friends and i always sit in the corner spot. i've never had problems with shady characters approaching us, so it's all good. the drinks are always strong and the service is typically really good. like i said, i only come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so it's usually pretty empty. as for the other yelpers that gave them low ratings due to the cover charge, i agree with you. the cover prices they have are ridiculous, especially for fight nights, but give them another shot solely for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it may make you change your mind on tequila hoppers!
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is freakin awesome. half off everything from 2 - 8 everyday and they do raffles every friday giving away a free flatscreen tv. fun place. food is good not great
what can i say that hasn't been said about this place. great prices on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, food is ok and the servers are made to look like funny bunnies. those are the upsides if you will. terrible service, crappy atmosphere, &nbsp;terrible service, lack of knowledge about their own items, and terrible service. if you can get past all this and the douchebag men and women this is your spot. oh and make sure to watch out for &quot;natalie&quot; she'll forget everything you ordered.
drinks are good with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> being 40% off all drinks....food sucks though. service was good the girls are nice. music kindve sucks, it was my first time there, i dnt know if i would really go back....too empty
loveee this place, for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday 2-8, its super long and half off everything on the menu! my boyfriend and i go there for the mile high nachos, definitely worth it and they live up to their name! and the pitchers of beer (before i was pregnant) theres a ton of flatscreens and 2 pool tables. sometimes service can be a little slow but it can get pretty busy, once we started going there all the time the waitress remembered us and we got a lot faster service. definitely can't get a better <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> than this!=) also, after the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends at 8 they have different specials diff nights of the week, i like saturdays for the $3 you call its (or whatever they specifically call it!) make your own drinks for a good price!!=]
had a few drinks and a few appetizers at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, decently priced. went to the bathroom, and was waiting for the stall. during that time, a guy puked in he sink and clogged it, they were out of toilet seat protectors and i found a bag that appears to have previously stored drugs.
ghetto, ghetto, ghetto!!!!! only reason it gets anything above 1 star is because they do have insanely low drink prices during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and a ton of tv's.
celebrated a friends birthday...they over charged on two bills...the girl closed out because she was leaving wth... never heard that before....even another host was like i'm not sure why she did that. then had to wait to open it up again. one star for okay <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. definitely won't be going back there.
cheap beer but cheap people. &nbsp;the ghetto of ontario and upland call this place home. i will go here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but once the tables are moved out and the place becomes a &quot;club&quot; i'm out. &nbsp;not really into having old cholo's hit up on me. &nbsp;food's good though.
worst experience ever! lady at the front was very rude. you have to stand up and wave at the waiters to come to your table. it took 30 minutes! 30 minutes to get our drink. waiters never stopped at our table the whole time. place is cool. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good. service is horrible! ruined my experience. never coming here again. won't recommend this place to anyone.
we've been coming here for a long, long time. ever since the current management took over it has steadily gone downhill. very depressing and dirty. it's no wonder the waitresses &nbsp;seem as though they don't want to be there. i can see why all the rest of the regulars won't come here any more. the food is hit and miss, but ever since they did away with 40% off on food at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> we are done with this place. so good luck to the fat blonde manager that's all you have going for you.
good food average prices. &nbsp;good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. this place used to be a favorite of mine, but now the get pregnant contagion is in full swing. &nbsp;there are plenty of better breastaurants in the area with ladies that make the time and the money spent more worth it. &nbsp;i used to drop $20 for food and $50 in tips for the girls: this time i tipped $2 and walked out.
i've come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which is not competitive compared to other places in the neighborhood. this place becomes a club during the after <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. when it becomes a club, this place gets packed with people. it's the only place in town that i have found where women have to pay to get it, whether or not its crackin or totally dead. there is no way to find this out until you pay the $5 fee and step through the doors. :-(taco tuesdays are chill to catch a game and enjoy some $2.00 beers and tacos.
love tequila hoppers!!!! the food and service is outstanding, especially <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;my favorite items are the macho nachos yummm and their mexican chicken salad! &nbsp;great place to meet friends after work play a game of pool, and watch the numerous games on their flat screen tv's.
cool &nbsp;place to have a cold one during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and watch sports on the dozens of tv's all around the joint, &nbsp;service was decent during my visit and it get busy as the evening progresses, &nbsp;we ordered a mexisampler plate and it was nor good at all, &nbsp;the meat on the tacos was dried out and just unappealing at all, but is best to pair food when consuming alcohol to better handle it.
their beer selection was good. their service was good as well, however the reason why i'm leaving them a 4 star rating is because i felt that the appetizer like the zucchini wedges weren't really up to bar. the breading was rough and the amount they give you for the cost wasn't worth it. other than that, it's a cool place to watch your favorite teams play! plus they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 6 to 8pm (i believe) !
best selection of beers and drinks in the area. best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 40% off everything until 8pm or 8:30. but either way its a great deal for what you can get. especially compared to other bars. the selection here puts other bars to sleep. ive noticed their beer selection is always changing and improving. if youre a beer freak youll love this place.
i have been going to this place for the last 7 years . its great for watching football,and lakers &nbsp;games on sundays and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;specials are half off everything on the menu from 2:30 -8 . this place always has some type of drink special going after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;ends. it used to turn into a small club on fri and sat but that has gone down in the past years . the crowds are not as big as they used to be and the girls arent as cute as they used to be but its still a cool place to hang . they have an outdoor smoking patio, 2 dart board ,and &nbsp;2 pool tables .you might not want to finish your night here on a fri or saturday but its a great place to start .be sure to come by on tues night , its always packed and always a good time .
it has it's moments. when you're a regular and you get to know the waitresses, this place is a good time. if you're new or just haven't been in awhile don't expect to get the best of service. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good and taco tuesday is worth it's weight in carne asada. other than that, it's a very typical sports bar with some interesting activities when the [televised] games are over (10pm+),
i stop in here time to time when i don't feel classy or particularly pretty, but am in search of a good time without leaving upland/claremont. on weeknights its usually full of middle-aged men just off work watching the game. they have about 20 tv screens. whatever game you want is on. the beer list is pretty impressive, and when they say &quot;small&quot; they mean a pint. the food is typical bar faire, nothing special but better than some and fairly affordable during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which is pretty much all the time. speaking of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, since no one else has i feel obligated to let you in on the deals:every day 2:30-8 half off food and drinkstaco tuesday (7pm) $2 mexican bottles, $1.50 tequila shots, .75 tacoslatin wednesdays (8pm) 1/2 of draft beer, appetizers, margaritasthursty thursdays: i sadly don't recall, but it starts at 7friday/saturday: you call it well-drinks $3.50 with a $5 cover after 8pm)sin sunday: 1/2 off food and drink all dayoverall it's a gross sports bar with lots of cheap, delicious beer.
went here with the wife on wensday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. everything was 50% off. &nbsp;i tryed arrogant bastard for the first time and .........well if you like guinness ur love bastared. &nbsp;i did try new castle summer ale and fell in love. &nbsp;the food was ok. we tryed the sampler (cheese sticks,quesadillas,potato skins). &nbsp;the bar keep was nice looking. kinda had a strang six pack going on. anyway see you next wensday yelpers!
this has been one of my favorite inland empire <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> for years and years. great prices, decent food (the tacos suck though) and a big location. two things: 1) this is a great place to get a dui. the cops stake out the parking lot, be careful.2) i don't think they've ever cleaned the lines for their taps. the last few times i've gone the beers i ordered tasted awful. they're unresponsive to fix this problem and i only order bottled beer there now.hopefully the management reads yelp and attends to these problems or i may end up taking my business elsewhere.
this is one of the most polarizing bars in the ie. &nbsp;either you love it here or you hate it. &nbsp;i've been here more times than i can count so my review is coming from a different perspective. &nbsp;i've been here on taco tuesdays, celebration &quot;holidays&quot; (st. patty's day, cinco de mayo), friday and saturday nights and football sundays. &nbsp;i keep coming back so i obviously love it. &nbsp;pretty good food, it's never made me sick and always well cooked. &nbsp;i suggest the mexican sampler. &nbsp; so fire &nbsp;and their drinks are awesome especially the bulldog and rose-royce margarita. &nbsp;and on sundays, they have an all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with their drinks being 40% off. &nbsp;how does it get better than that? &nbsp;the atmosphere is fun. &nbsp;i've never seen any fights break out since i've been there. &nbsp;anyone that's there is there to have fun and nothing less. i gave it four stars for two reasons: 1. they do charge to get in on the weekends after a certain time. &nbsp;$10 i believe which i think is absurd and the bathroom situation. &nbsp;they're too close together and too small. &nbsp;outside of that, if you're looking for a fun bar to turn up at for cheap, this is your spot.
this is our go-to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you can't beat it! 50% off all drinks and food 2-8pm seven days a week?!?! we try to come here at least once a month and invite a few of our friends to hang out. my husband loves the danny burger made with the parmesan bread and i go with the chicken strips and chili cheese fries (which i absolutely adore!). their chili cheese fries are bad ass because they use chili with meat (yes, meat!) and kidney beans. they have a large choice of beers on tap and i love their well margaritas. service can be give or take (depending on how busy it is) but overall it is always worth the wait. after you experience the spend thriftiness of tequila hoppers, no other <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> will compare. only downside is if you're there purely for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a saturday, make sure there's no ufc that night because hh will end at 6pm and then they want to charge $10 a person to stay after 6pm. also, the last time we used the juke box you couldn't hear the music i paid for (the old one used to work very well) so don't waste your money on that or using those <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2frestaurant.com&amp;s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restaurant.com</a> coupons. tequila hoppers always has a special and you'll never be able to use it (overheard a couple trying to use it during hh--no dice). i haven't been to the &quot;club&quot; part of it but i hear it can be a little ghetto but i'd love to go just to people watch for train wrecks. :) &nbsp;the only other downside are what the ladies wear as part of their &quot;work attire&quot; which might work for the gents but does nothing for me. when i used to go there in the early 2000s, the girls wore referee short/skirt combos and a short shirt but as time went on, it seemed they would be wearing less and less clothing. at one point, they were just wearing bikinis and my husband and i joked that the next time we would come in, it would be a topless bar. ;) even with that, i'm too economical to not go for some great food and drinks.
been to this place a couple of times. &nbsp;alot to be desired here. &nbsp;service is very slow....faster to just go the bar and get your own drinks, food is dice roll...some of it is good, some bad. &nbsp;clientele is definitely a younger punk type crowd. &nbsp;cover charge isnt worth the experience..!! &nbsp;if you go...go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and roll before 7pm...it doesnt get any better as the evening comes on.
went here on a friday evening to watch the yankees game. i was hesitant after the previous reviews. to my surprise i had fun &amp; enjoyed the hospitality of the employees. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is till 8pm which is 50% off everything on the menu! nachos &amp; buffalo wings were excellent! drinks were great &amp; made strong (to my liking)! beers were 50% off too. after 9pm it because a small club. i had a great time &amp; look forward to going again!
this place has one of the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing 7 days a week. the 40% off anything you want whether being food or alcohol drinks is awesome! the food surprisingly is a+ with large portions ...example i ordered the mile high nachos and they were huge..only about $6 too! &nbsp;the chicken taco salad with grilled chicken was very good as well.the cherry on top were all the huge screens showing multiple sports games.only con is when it gets busy the waitresses always forgets either to bring our drinks or check up on us.. i've learned simply to go to the bar n order the drinks n bring it back to the table.
i can't say that i'd travel out of my way to get to tequila hoppers however if you're in the area it's definitely worth a stop....to my recollection, someone already commented on it however the food here is as hit or miss as the hospitality provided by their staff. i've never had a bad experience per se' but on occasion, the waitress did go into hibernation requiring me to search for someone else.the music is typically cranked up to full volume and this place has more flat screens than best buy. as someone stated as well, this place does become a club after <span class="highlighted">hours</span> (fyi) and in turn, parking can become extremely tight. aside of that they charge for everyone - regardless of your gender.the &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; prices can't be beat $2 shots, wells and appetizers). come to think of it, why am i not there ---- now?
the best nachos!!... hamburgers fantastic and the chicken teriyaki sandwich in beyond good. &nbsp;ok...so it is loud sometimes...and the waitresses dress skimpy...bikini-ish. &nbsp;but...they act very professionally and it is not uncomfortable. &nbsp;you just have to pick when you go. &nbsp;from 2:30-8 every night is <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...and everything on the menu is 50% off. &nbsp;i highly recommend the nachos....1/2 order...2 of you won't be able to finish it as a meal!!
i am a regular here &amp; i absolutely love it! i believe they have 88 beers on draft, full bar, and some of the best food i've ever had at a storts bar, all for half price during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which i might add is everyday! the only thing i noticed that i wasn't pleased with was that they were a little bias with certain individuals and they're dress code, i even witnessed then turn people away because they had jerseys on, come on folks, it's a sports bar.
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> restaurant in upland. i wish they would add more items to there menu but my favorite is the big danny burger. also like trying different beers; large selection of beers on tap and bottles. has the most tv's i've seen in any sports bar. i'm a regular so i don't get carded and the service is good. i go to hang out with friends and watch laker games.
love this place! best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around! from 2:30 - 8pm everyday! 40% off everything. during football &amp; <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, my husband and i usually get a half order of nachos (the full order is huge!), a few tacos, jalapeno poppers &amp; about 3-4 beers each and its always around $35. you cant beat that. .on friday and saturday nights they have a dj. its $5 to get in. no dress code. they have specials starting at 8pm - 40% off on all liquor - they serve food until midnight and music all night. they have a ton of beers on tap that are ice cold. big selection of food that is very good. always has a great atmosphere with mostly friendly staff. the bouncers don't tolerate much so it keeps all the bs out. our favorite server is vivian! she's awesome. always has so much energy and is so positive. definitely the best there!&amp; i say mostly friendly because there are a couple girls with pissy attitudes, very short with guests. couple weeks ago, we had issues over a sever not knowing what section she had (vivian had already gone home for the night). understandable, i'm a server. i get it. but when she finally realized it, she came to the table with &quot;what do you want?&quot; really? we sat there for 20 mins and no i'm sorry, i was busy. sorry for the wait. thanks for being patient (because we were). nothing. not even a hello! so i told her we didn't need anything anything,&amp; that we would go to the bar. i pulled a manager to the side and she was sincerely sorry. she bought us our first round and sent over a new server for us. really turned the beginning of a bad experience around. haven't had an issue since. overall, this place is great!
expensive.just your average quality pre-frozen, then nuke n serve mediocre bar food. nothing special, no inspiration.high prices on food and drink.you can do better elsewhere on food quality for less money.we bought a round for the bar that we were charged for but no one got their drinks.self-centred bartender vanished down a black hole and never came back.dated, old, oddball, shop worn tv's, no high definition.tequila hoppers website is abandon since 2010.neglected atmosphere and no energy like when absentee owners who have lost interest are trying to sell the place for more than it's worth.doubt we'll ever go back for anything more than a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special drink, then it'll only be hit and run.friendly cocktail service when / if the help sticks around.
this place has a different <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ever day and it is awesome. the service can be real good, and than it can be lame. but the prices for sure is what gets you to go back. they have &quot;security&quot;just in case. i love that they have 80 beers of draft, than they have a large amount of beers in bottles. the bar area is awesome, i've always like the way that they designed it. the have to small coin operated pool tables, and they also have darts. they have dancing friday and saturday, don't come here just for the dancing. no one really seems to come for that. cover charges for men. parking is ok. they good at keeping your empty off the tables. this place is cool for groups i also like to come watch sports here, they have a lot tvs
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing 40% off before 8, and different drink specials each night after 8! cover charge on friday and saturdays! it's gets packed pretty quick especially if there's a large sporting event that night or taco tuesday. not enough parking so get there early. pete (one of the night bartenders) is the best! he's very attentive and can hold a conversation well. i don't know many of the waitresses because i only sit at the bar but most of them seem friendly and approachable. there are a few that seem to always have a mean look on their face. best to use cash, because if you start a tab and leave a card they run it at the beginning and the end so you will have a few pending charges for about a week but only one will clear. 4 stars because i've been arrested here twice! my fault lol!
let's be serious... it is not fair to expect exceptional service and amazing atmosphere from a joint called 'tequila hoppers'. &nbsp;the name itself assumes that you go there to get fucked up. &nbsp;that is why tequila hoppers exists, and that is what i use it for.my niglet jenny and i discovered tequila hoppers years ago, and it's a bearable distance away. &nbsp;service is usually slow, regardless of how many people are in the bar. &nbsp;sometimes, you have to clean your own tables, and sometimes you have to go up to the bar to ask for things, but in all honesty i have never gotten overcharged or cheated by any waitress at tequila hoppers. &nbsp;this is not something i can say for every bar i've ever been to. i can ensure that it is almost always a spot for people watching.the food isn't half bad. &nbsp;the crunchy, greasy bar foods we all know and love are especially good. &nbsp;try the chili-cheese curly fries, cream cheese jalepeno poppers and good old quasi-mexican bar foods. &nbsp;a new discovery by my favorite jenny - - downright amazing fish and chips. &nbsp;who knew??!!??!!don't go there on a date!don't go there to see and be seen!don't dress up and pretend like it's a club!don't pay cover and complain about it - you could have just left!go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, get everything half off and just get over it. &nbsp;the last time jenny and i went and hung out for about 4 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of laughing, gossiping and drinking for less than $20 each! &nbsp;it's a bargain. &nbsp;and sometimes god comes to us lowly humans and tell us that we can go drink totally alkie-satisfying amounts for totally economic-downturn prices if we're willing to not sweat the small stuff. &nbsp;so if you really think about it, through the magic of tequila hoppers 7-day a week, every-single-freaking-item half off <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, god is making us <span class="highlighted">happy</span> and teaching us important life lessons.damn, that's deep.
this place was one of the first places i was exposed to when i turned 21 and its stuck on me for a few years. &nbsp;back in the day my friends and i used to roll there 2x sometimes 3x a week when i was still in college. &nbsp;in 2005 i'd say tequila hoppers was a good fun place to hang out at, it was consistently crowded, drink prices are good, and the dj's were better. &nbsp;now in 2010 it's gone way down, the place looks scummy, high cover charges and they charge on thursdays! (maybe used to, i don't know now) &nbsp;the patrons are just as the other yelpers say .. not the greatest crowd to hang out with. &nbsp;after expanding my spots over the years, tequila hoppers is definitely not on my top lists of spots to go to at night.pros: -<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 7 days a week, great for an afternoon outing-nightly drink specials apply right after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>-two large projection screens for sportscons:-high cover charges on certain nights, there are way more options locally than tequila hoppers and many who are cheaper than $10 and some don't even charge a cover-very slow service at times, messy tables-bouncers who think they're hard-staff neglects to mention when specials are off based sporting events and time, it's one of those things you have to already know
i have come here only during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for football season or hockey (go kings!!!) and i always have a great time. all the sandwiches/burgers i've ordered are good. the appetizers are eh nothing too special...could be better. i feel like they are the frozen ones you could buy at any market. service depends on the waitress. i've had great service days and horrible service days. the first time i came i asked about the bottled beer selection and the waitress told me they had everything, so i ordered an asahi. &nbsp;she quickly notified me that they don't carry asahi. haha. i guess they really don't carry everything then! i still come regardless of their service off days to hang with friends and watch some hockey and football. i love that they have several tvs everywhere so you can watch your game or catch another sport. they also have a huge movie screen with sound playing the most important games. during football season, they give out raffle tickets with every purchase for a tv that's raffled at the end of the game. during hockey season they have a 40% off everything <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...over 80 beers on tap! &nbsp;we got a pitcher of our current fav, hangar 24 ipa. &nbsp;food was above average for bar food. &nbsp;got a half order of nachos (but you would never believe it's half) with chicken and beef, next time it will be just chicken. &nbsp;nothing wrong with the beef but the chicken was way better. &nbsp;we both got a burger, fries &amp; onion rings. &nbsp;burgers and fries were ok but the onion rings were fantastic...i got mine extra crispy. &nbsp;tvs plaster all the walls, you could easily watch 4 games without shifting your eyes! &nbsp;there are also pool tables and dart boards...and the place turns into a dance club at night but i can't comment on that.all in all, i will definitely come back...and recommend to friends!
i had my 21st bday party here and it was going well but then as time passed we were waiting on our food for like an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> the waitress was kinda taking awhile and the workers/manager were very rude!!! my friend who came the same night told me that the waitress had taken $20 from her and she has a receipt to prove it and she had confronted the manager and she did not even look them in the eye basically the bouncer was talking for her. i mean that's not the bouncers business to talk for the manager that's her title for a damn reason! any way i just think if u come to this place make sure they don't rip you off be aware of what your spending! as for drinks they had nearly everything good specials and deals when it comes to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> alone warrants 3 stars. the beer is good, 75 cent tacos. good place after work when you're broke and just looking for a couple beers and some cheap (but yummy) tacos.i went once on a saturday night cuz i heard it &quot;turns into&quot; a club. i don't know what kind of 'club' it turned into, but it was pretty skank. and i say that in the most flattering way possible.first thing i noticed - lots of big girls. i'm a big girl myself, so i notice these things. super hood crowd, lots of gangbangers with their baby mamas. the dance floor is small, made smaller by the large girls who frequent it. the dress code seems to be ghetto fabulous (light on the fabulous) and you will get pat down heavily by the bouncers.the outside patio is probably the best asset. $10 cover is entirely too much for what they're offering.if you're a big girl - you'll feel very comfortable here.if you're a guy who likes big girls - consider this a buffet.
expensive cover for ufc ($10 a person)good atmosphere, but most only seemed interested at the main event.food, ordered from best to worst. &nbsp;buffalo wings were actually pretty good.mile high nachos are decent, better than the chilli fries.calimari. &nbsp;bad bad bad.zuccini sticks, equally bad.drinks:<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on beer are pretty good, prices seem a bit high otherwise (eg.. $24 pitcher)pina colada apparently was terrible, low alcohol, and was chunky chunky ice, not well blended at all, maybe it was made with a hammer instead of a blender.service. &nbsp;courteous waitresses, but slow, and never came back to check on table or refill water.overall, food wasn't good, and cover was high... won't be back, 2 1/2 stars
i think this place has one the best <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> i have ever been to....ever. the music is actually decent. &nbsp;food is good however there is one problem that i have with them. i ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and i asked for a pickle. what a suprise when i looked at my bill and i was charged a $1 for my 1 pickle. the waitress never informed of it but and was shocked to see it because i'd never thought i'd see a charge for it. i asked the waitress why? she said because of the recession that they charge for all add ones like pickles, lettuce, onions, etc. i am not cheap by all means but damn really. luckily the food was actually good!
i may as well be considered a regular here. i have celebrated my birthday there twice as well as all of my friends. if we're not celebrating a birthday we are just chilling. as many of you have mentioned, the service is a hit or miss. there is one &quot;waitress&quot; there who is all around terrible.. not sure her name, i just know her by her terrible amanda bynes-esque extensions. avoid avoid avoid her tables at all costs. there drinks are priced about average for a bar, beware the cut off time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, there were a couple times where we lost track of time and wound up with a couple hundred dollar bill! our fault, would of appreciated a heads up for the cut off but oh well.tv's galore!---need i say more?when it is a nightclub you can expect an array of music from old school hip hop/r&amp;b to todays current hits mixed decently. if you get there early enough you don't have to pay to get in but really who wants to get there at 4pm??make sure you try the buffalo strip nugget things! they are probably swanson brand that you can buy anywhere but with a nice cold beer and a vat of ranch for dipping you are in sport watching heaven!
i really wanted to like this place! the outside looks so pretty! and tequila is myyyyy poison of choice! as soon as i walk in, i hear &quot;jump, jump&quot; bumpin' on the speakers. &nbsp;nice! old skool...i like it. the bouncer looked mean but i guess that is their job. plus, i always enjoy getting carded (now!). then we went to the bar area and it was open seating. the waitress took a long time to take our order and not many people were there. they have a greaaaat variety of beers. and i think they are half-off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they also had 0.75 cent wings! woooot woooot! i order 10! well, they came back all soaked in bbq sauce. the waitress also tempted us with a $2 shot. i think it was called a sunset something...it was quite delicious and it didn't taste like it had any alcohol (but those are the worst kind...) they also have pool tables which looked like fun from afar. all in all, the food wasn't too great, the service was slow, and i also heard that fights break out a lot. but it looks soooo nice from the outside! come on, upland! can we feel the love?
had an awsome time tequila hoppers bar and grill inc. last night. they have some new beers on the menu, and our favorite waitress, mary, was anxious for us to sample them. our favorite, peanutbutter stout. this is truly one of the best beers i've had in a while. gives dale bros brewery's mango shandy a run for it's money, although they are two different breeds intirely, to be fair. their food is fantastic. &nbsp;if you're looking for a burger, this is it! &nbsp;try their mushroom burger, bbq burger or bourbon burger, you can't go wrong! &nbsp;they also have the best onion rings around, and their pizza is good. &nbsp;their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals can't be beat. &nbsp;40% off. &nbsp;it's what got us in there, and we keep going back. &nbsp;if there are large sporting events, there may be a cover charge, so that's a downer when you're just looking for an early dinner and some drinks. mary is the best of the best when it come to servers! &nbsp;she always remembers us and what types of beer we like.
i am old and married and way past my bar hopping/clubbing days...plus i am a mom....so why, you ask did i enter this place....well, i'll tell ya. the sign outside said buy one get one free lunch entree from noon to 2:00. hubs and i were hungry...and intrigued so we went in...at like 1:00 p.m. on a saturday...seriously, we increased the population of the bar 100%.to say it was dead is an understatement....hubs had a burger and fries and two beers - bass. i had a steak sandwich with onion rings. hubs' burger was huge and really good....my sandwich was just enh...but the onion rings were really good. we paid like $ 20.00 with tip. however, 1/2 way thru our meal a couple came in...must have been tweakers....they had that pocked face, fidgety way about them....had no teeth and looked like they just rolled in from mississippi.....total white trash...then it gets better.....they were dixie loving, in bred freaks all tatted up with white pride tats. classy.so, while i have no idea about what <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or the 'club' (i use that term loosely)is like....the lunch special was good, the tweakers were free entertainment....so, if you are bored to tears or hung over and need a greasy meal and cheap beers to get over the hang over hump.....plus to see either inbred jed and his sister/wife or some gang bangers....check this place out.

i love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here the staff is really nice and there side table guacamole is so good. i recomend there tropical sunrise.
came in with my friend during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a sunday. server was great paid great attention and right away as soon as we sat made us aware of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. my friend and i were here for couple of <span class="highlighted">hours</span> enjoying a chat and we were still receiving great customer service. definitely will come here more often
get there before the rush.. we went at 1130 on sunday.. bar had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! whoo hooo!! amazing service and i love the layout of this chili's!! &nbsp;ok chili's is not my first choice of places to go.. but this new one in the colonies is super nice and i love the dinner for 2 for 20. &nbsp;whoo hoo
of all the chain restaurants in the area, my circle of friends are drawn to this one. i'm a fan of the strong margaritas, especially the presidente. if only they'd leave the bottle of tequila on the table, i'd never leave.for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> this place is great. get yourself a beer, a queso skillet and a good friend. the bartenders are typcially friendly. this location tends to attract mall flys, that is, employees from the neighboring montclair plaza. here is another place where i had a star sighting: pamela anderson with her boys. cute mama in person, for real.for dinner, there's no place better for a steak. oops! not sure if i should be ordering a steak medium-rare in front of my vegan friend, but i think she anticipates it. this past weekend we had with a very cute balloon boy who made star a butterfly. i think she named it flyey.the following night we arrive for late-nite drinks, but were told that they close at 10:30 pm on sunday. really? this is why i hate the ie. the bartender was nice enough to suggest another bar. hmm? i wonder if corporate would be <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to hear that.
corner-pub-ontario
do not judge a book by it's cover. this a great little bar to kick back and relax at. don't bother asking the bartender for drink specials/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, because it's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day with the best prices in town. there is always a mixed crowd, and they welcome everyone. i love playing darts here with the locals. stop in and have a few!
i have been coming to this bar since i was 21. if you like good friendly staff and dive bars this is the place to come. if you are just flying in ontario international or business. or you just need a beer after work. there really is no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but all drinks are priced greatly.
this bar very close to home, but besides that, the bar has a set of regulars whom are very nice people. i enjoy stopping in for just one or for a few. the pool tables and darts are a positive addition to the bar. they even have people/customers bring in food for special occasions which makes it even a better place to visit! i love the senior citizen staff here! reminds me of my grampa!i suck at pooldon't finish your drink before you order another!ryan is bartending so gunna be a good nite... well till 10:58...gotta be home before she gets off work.$0.50 pool and $2.25 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beer!oh yeah gotta cold glass...disregard the previous tip!don't give the bartender an empty glass, cuz he will use it again &amp; againturn a/c on and serve me my drink!walk here and u won't get hurtclose to home! if u ride a bike the will lock it up in the back.
applebees-montclair
good place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> good selection of beers good appetizers as well. best night would be wensday karaoke nights
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was cool... service was prompt at the bar. she was nice and super attentive about our drinks. basically as soon as i was finished with my beer, she offered to give me another. this was really nice but i feel like i spent more than i meant to (lol).
first off this place is lame to come to for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and second we didn't get ask what beverages we wanted to for a good 20 mins we sat down on top of that the food sucked
went in for late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> friday night, 5/15/15. the male bartender was quick, attentive, and non-intrusive. great service. strangely, there wasn't a bro to be seen anywhere, something ubiquitous with applebee's. not a single angel's or dodger's cap. it was very nice and pleasant. i am not giving it five stars because the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> appetizer of spinach artichoke dip is noticeably smaller than the regular menu. i'm sure it's smarter for me to have a smaller portion, but i want to feel like a disgusting animal from eating appetizers: not a calorie-conscious person.
food was apple bees good, but something was pretty off tonight at this location :/came here late night about 10pm. we were &nbsp;greeted by 2 hostess and asked what type of seating. i asked if there's a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and one of them said &quot;yeah we have a dinner special!&quot;. so yay! and self seating at the bar. me and my partner assumed the high tables too, but then they stopped us saying that they only have 3 servers, 1 in each section (booths/tables, and high tops in bar area). we decided to wait for high top since we wanted <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food.finally got to our table and our server was a sweetheart. i asked where's their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special foods and she replied there's none. so the hostess deceive me :/ and worse she had an impatient attitude. since it was only 3 servers tonight, service was pretty slow but our waitress was still sweet and smiley.what makes this whole night a mess is that they are clearly understaffed of waiters on a saturday night. i don't know their logic, but it's saturday! how can you not have more servers? i know the economy is just okay, but it doesn't mean downgrade on service, especially when it's thur-sat with great chances of many people dining and enjoying the night life.i'm very wary of returning to this location for dinner.
came here for sunday dinner with the family and the service was great! our waitress was very attentive and made sure to check on us regularly. the food came out in a timely fashion and the manager even swung by to make sure everything was good at our table. this location also has great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
9 o'clock <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!! how can you go wrong!!!! 3 dollar domestics and 3 dollar mixed drinks(they have like 6 for you to chose). well worth it.. and honey bbq wings uber bomb
i go here once in a while...always good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>... went here today for take out tonight...got some shrimp weight watcher meal...closed out at bar...curbside closes at 9pm...hey when there is nothing else to get semi healthy late night...definitely can hit up the weight watcher menu...yum

super small place, so you wont have a seat on a weekend, unless you get there pretty early. the drinks are poured pretty stiff, but nothing real fancy about this place, and it isnt &quot;dive bar&quot; cheap. the food is pretty good, nothing great. definitely better mid-week for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. not horrible though, and my wife really likes it. i've been about 10 times, and im sure we will go another 10 through out the years.
tj mccutchins has a sports bar atmosphere with better than average bar food. &nbsp;jd salingers has a little bit of outdoor seating and one flatscreen outside.jg wentworth's has lots of daily specials.one of my favorite daily <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials at aj spumoni's is the sliders.on slider night at pd eastman's they have a fixin's bar.come to think of it, at hr puff n' stuffs they may have the fixin's bar all the time.we have been here to mj tolkein's probably 5 or 6 times and my wife still calls it something different every time, hence the many references to kd burelli's.anyway, look for upscale bar food and sports bar atmosphere at jk rowling's!
this place is okay. i work in the area and always passed by the place so i stopped in. first thing i noticed the minute i walked through the door was a weird smell that overwhelmed the place. didn't smell like a certain type of food or burnt food it smelled more like wet clothes lol but x10. like a weird smell like that. like clothes have been sitting out for a while. i was like whatever. sat down at a table and soon the smell was gone cause i got used to it. anyway i went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but skipped on a decent drink selection and ordered a chicken caesar salad with water. food was really good, i love chicken salads and this one was yummy. the place is kinda small but it's not awful. it's hard to get your server when you need her sometimes cause she has like every table in the place but she was friendly. i probably would go back but not as a first pick place to eat. the smell really turned me off, it was really bad. but the food made up for it.
j.d.'s is a little bar in downtown upland. kinda small but the bar seats about 10 and there are 5-10 little tables plus outside patio seating. when the lemon festival comes to town in late april the patio is prime real estate. it boasts a full bar with reasonable prices and a decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the food is surprisingly good.
this place wants to be your neighborhood go-to bar.walking in, i first noticed the open kitchen, then the l-shaped bar that seats maybe 15 people, and plenty of tvs for the sports fanatic. &nbsp;it seems like a cross between an upscale sports bar, lounge, and a california pizza kitchen with all the contemporary amenities.we sat ourselves at an open table. &nbsp;our server seemed really dedicated to her job. &nbsp;service was curt and she didn't seem like she wanted to chit-chat as we asked her why the old baldy brewery next door closed down, but didn't get an answer. &nbsp; we ordered pomona queen, which is similar to a killian's red, on draft. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> run from 3-7pm and each of our pints cost about $3.79.we were in luck as they had $1 tacos yesterday. &nbsp;you tell your server how many tacos everyone can eat, she gives you tickets, then you take it to the guy serving tacos at the kitchen counter. &nbsp;there are also plenty of hot sauces, cilantro, onions, tomatoes, salsa, and other condiments for your &nbsp;tacos. &nbsp;you have to hurry as last call for tacos end around 8pm, but varies because the sign says, &quot;$1 taco tuesdays! &nbsp;3pm - ?&quot; &nbsp;ooh. &nbsp;the question mark makes it so mysterious like party invitations.tuesdays - $1 taco night (tiny 3&quot; diameter tortillas)wednesdays - karaoke nightfriday - djsaturday - live music

love this place. the house pan roast(mild) is my favorite! they have blue point oysters at a really good price. staff is friendly. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is pretty awesome too!
been here several times now, and we still like it. &nbsp;we like it even more now that they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> since they have clam chowder and their calamari on the menu. &nbsp;the clam chowder is really good, and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> portions are filling. &nbsp;the oysters, which are also on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, taste fresh. &nbsp;good service, too. &nbsp;from their regular menu, we love the pan roast.
this place never lets me down. &nbsp;food is always good. &nbsp;with food this good, it is very satisfying. &nbsp;give the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu a try. &nbsp;none of it disappoints.
i love this place! i went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and started off with the bacon wrapped shrimp and crab cakes. both were delicious and came out really fast. i ordered the jambalaya with a spice level of 7, it wasn't that spicy i'll probably up it to an 8 the next time i go. there was tons of shrimp and andouille
love this place! the pan roasts are amazing...i made the mistake of ordering my gumbo really spicy and i wasn't able to enjoy it. the management is great and the staff is really friendly. i love the appetizer sampler that they have during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>..their sausages are amazing. it's kind of pricey but its worth it every now and then. if you like spicy, this is a good place to go. it's never too crowded. try going during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>..they have great deals. it may not look like a lot of food at first but i never finish it! great place.
gumbo was good-the base was thicker than we've had before. shrimp scampi with linguine was great and you can choose hotness and add and take things out to make it just who you like it! &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> til 6pm so they have great oyster shooters for $3(2).
my husband and i have only been here for dinner. their dinner portions are huge and more than enough for you to share. they also have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials during the beginning of their dinner <span class="highlighted">hours</span>.i would recommend their house pan roast if you enjoy seafood and the calamari appetizer.
had the louisiana oysters on the half shell for an appetizer... on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. awesome, huge meaty oysters served with lemon, cocktail sauce and horseradish. 2 oysters for 3 bucks. niiice. had the house pan roast... and it was... amazing. big pieces of seafood, delicious sauce. it was a hefty portion, couldn't finish it all, so brought the rest home with me. my server, myra (i think) was great.i'll definitely be back.
everytime i come here i always order the same thing cilantro chicken and sausage #4. i'm not a big fan of the too spicy ones. they hve <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> at 4pm to 6pm. the crab cakes are a must try. it is really good. i have tried almost everything on the menu from my boyfriend's plate. they aren't too bad too. they are actually pretty good. the service is always very good here.
great service - happened to show up at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the good news - a small selection of beer on draft. &nbsp;too bad the appetizer jalepeno poppers tasted of raw flour breading. &nbsp;pan roast was good as the rice portion was not too big.
they have amazing food here. my all time favorite is the house pan roast and it is just amazing. i've tried a few of there entrees but i always come back to hpr. the service here is great. the staff is very attentive. also if its your first time here, sit at the counter its always a cool experience. you can see how the chefs make the dishes. they also have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials as well, try the crab cakes and calamari.
its from the chef that worked at palace station oyster bar and the pan roasts remind us exactly of the palace station but the place is cleaner and when we went no wait so thats cool too. they also have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on some select apps and beer.
i went on a monday evening. there were not that many people which was fine, no wait! had the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> calamari and pan roast. the calamari was like biting into a cheesestick. nice thick portions of squid with just enough batter crunch. the pan roast was ok. i thought it was too rich after a few bites on its own. it had a good amount of shrimp and lobster. the rice that accompanied it was so small. an extra bowl costs over $1.50. thats outrageous! not sure if id go back for the price is not worth the food.
the food here is amazing. i used to be one of the cooks here for a while. every dish here is good. it all depends on what you feel like eating.for appetizers the bacon wrap shrimp and oyster rockefellers i definitely recommend.for the entrees i personally think the jambalaya, house pan roast and gumbo are the top 3. for dessert i would recommend the creme brulee and bread pudding.they also have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials m-f 5pm-6:30pm
kettle cooked seafoodfood is good but i feel a bit pricey. &nbsp;the dinner pricing is around $15-$25 for an entree. &nbsp;lunch is cheaper and they have an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.everything comes in a bowl which means they are &quot;soupy&quot; in everything they serve. &nbsp;gumbo, jambalaya, chicken and sausage w/ noodle soup, house pan roast (which is like a chowder) etc.house pan roast: &nbsp;in a creamy tomato based chowder (heavy in the cream) with bits of crab meat, lobster, shrimp and clams very delicious! &nbsp;they were not shy about the portions of crab and lobster which i appreciated very much.linguini w/ clam white sauce: &nbsp;it looked sort of like soup there were a lot of white wine butter sauce in the bowl but it too was yummy.i'd say go there for a special occasion but too expensive for my budget these days. &nbsp;next time i'll hit up the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> =)staff were attentive and nice. &nbsp;place was crowded. &nbsp;sit at the bar if you want to be entertained, the chef cooks in steam kettles in front of you!
my friends and i dub this place, the best restaurant in the 909 because quite frankly, it is.i have been here on weekends and week days for dinner and there is usually not a wait. &nbsp;but one time i was here and it was packed, that has not happened since.it is a quaint little restaurant with table seating and bar seating. &nbsp;i always get the house pan roast. &nbsp;it is a thick seafood broth with a tomato base. &nbsp;they don't give you very much rice, which is unfortunate, but they give you unlimited french bread that can be used to be dipped into the broth. &nbsp;the bread soaks it all up and it is amazing.i also enjoy the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i believe it is from 4-6:30 pm, i believe even on weekends, but i am not 100% sure. &nbsp;i have had the sausage, it is not that great in my opinion, i wouldn't use my money on that dish. &nbsp;my go to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items are the 2 oysters on the half shell for $3 and the clam chowder! &nbsp;the must get here is the house pan roast!
we love coming to dinner here. we avoid the rush and get there early. sitting at the bar is the best. the chefs talk to you explain what's in the dishes and how it is cooked, they are all friendly. &nbsp;the food .... yummy! when they have the fresh clams in white wine sauce get it! they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu top picks the oysters rockefeller , and chowder. we always order the house pan roast! amazing!!! finish off the dinner with a creme br&ucirc;l&eacute;e ...
i love the setting of this restaurant. at first, the bar seating looked a bit intimidating. but as i sat down, i realized i had made a mistake not sitting there to watch the chef work his magic!<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=h7cpcnckbduhdtxqfzhmya&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>the service here was superb. they don't have a huge menu, which i love! but being first timers, there were endless questions. what is the most popular dish? which is your top choice? how spicy is spicy? what do you mean it's still <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>?!?!?<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3xtxqf7mgmmoeehcgatazg&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>we got there just in time before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended so we had to take advantage. the prices are about $1 off regular price, so we ordered clam chowder (yum), scallops, and the bacon wrapped shrimp.<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lafixac2zuf8ltzcom15-q&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>and let me tell you about these babies, they are absolutely to die for! i'm not the biggest fan of bacon nor cheese, but when you put them together with shrimp... you get a master symphony of incredible bursting inside your mouth. i would go back just for these suckers.i ordered the house pan roast, which is mixed seafood swimming in a tomato stew.<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_4-ilqvfujt-m8fp2tx4hq&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>my friend ordered the jambalaya, which i thought was quite delicious. he goes over the top with spice, so his level 6 spicy was bearable to me, which meant it did no damage to his taste buds. but luckily, the waitress came over with an extra side of spice to save the day.<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bofj2e9gofcfbsagpdkh2a&amp;userid=tragaoprys3-ynpsdnavtg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>
my mom took me and a few other family members here. we ate dinner here before going to my brother's marching band competition at ayala high school. my mom and dad have been here before and really liked the place. this place really reminded me of ritter's steam kettle cooking. we got there earlier than a couple people of our party so we ordered our drinks and appetizers. our server was nice and helpful. i got their iced green tea to drink. we were there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so we got their crab cakes and jalapeno poppers. the crab cakes were really good, big, plump and filled with a lot of crab. there were also some chopped peppers in onion in there too. the jalepeno poppers were hot, fresh and not too spicy. the cream cheese inside was piping hot. it's best to eat their poppers with a fork and knife. my mom ate it like finger food and it ended up exploding in her face. so be careful with those. when the rest of our party arrived we ordered our entrees. my mom and i split a caesar salad and their famous pan roast. the salad was really good, but caesar salad is my favorite anyways. it didn't have too much dressing and was topped with a generous helping of parmesan cheese. the pan roast was good too. we got it level five spicy which proved to be just a little too much spice for me, but the white rice helped cool it down. it was creamy, thick and had lots of treasures from the sea. my mom said it was a little too sweet for her liking, but i think the sweetness balanced out the spice really well. we skipped out on dessert because we had to leave and they didn't have beignets. they should really serve some beignets. this place was really good though, i'm glad my parents found this place.
finally, i don't have to drive all the way to las vegas to get a good pan roast!the staff here is very friendly, chef ritter is a great guy and easy to talk to. &nbsp;he comes straight from las vegas where he used to dish the pan roast at palace station where i used to have to go to satisfy my fix.the food is great here. &nbsp;the pan roast i thought was a little more seafooody than i remember, but its still good. &nbsp;i suggest getting the rice on the side instead of in the pan roast. &nbsp;the clam chowder is to die for, get the biggest bowl possible!! &nbsp;this place also has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and lunch sized/priced portions. &nbsp; will come back here again!
so after our annual vegas trip and trying oyster bar in palace station for the first time, i started craving the pan roast about a week later. &nbsp;so i started searching for a similar meal in my area. &nbsp;i found the boiler on yelp and was excited to see good reviews. &nbsp;so my gf and i decided to come on a sunday after church and was sort of perplexed to find the restaurant almost empty. &nbsp;it was around 3pm i think, so i wasn't expecting it to be packed, but there were maybe 2-3 tables and maybe 3-4 people at the bar total.either way, we sat down and noticed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and ordered up some beer, &nbsp;fries, oysters, and a house pan roast. &nbsp; i was a bit disappointed by the beer selection but whatever. &nbsp;the cajun fries were delicious. &nbsp;i love fries, especially seasoned fries, and these were spicy which i love as well. &nbsp;the oysters were good, not as fresh as oyster bar in vegas but still good. &nbsp;the rockefeller oysters were baked and came out piping hot but delicious. &nbsp;we enjoyed the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals for a pair of oysters and a discounted price. finally, the house pan roast. &nbsp;we ordered it at spiciness level 8. &nbsp;that was slightly disappointing as it was not spicy at all (for me). &nbsp;however, the flavor profile of the pan roast was pretty close to oyster bar, it just had less seafood which i expected based on the yelp reviews. &nbsp;anyways, everything was pretty good, service was good, food was good. &nbsp;i did go again a few weeks ago and it was actually better this time. &nbsp;we ordered the combo pan roast with sausage this time and it was better and had more seafood.
as if this place couldn't get any better... last week when i was there (sunday afternoon), they were offering <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! my anchor steam draft beer was $3! they also had appetizers on the hh menu, but we already ordered our hearty meals. i will be prepared next time - a 3 mile run before the boiler, so there's no excuse not to get tasty beer, creole sausage appetizer, and bouillabaisse!!
my wife and i came here for the first time last tuesday evening and we were very pleased. we arrived and were cheerfully greeted and promptly seated. we took advantage of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials and ordered a couple of house pinot grigios, crab cakes and bacon wrapped shrimp. all were delicious. for the main course my wife ordered the gumbo and i ordered the pan roast. both were well executed and available cooked to your level of spiciness. there was however something lacking in the seasonings as other yelpers have noted. as the servings are large, we had some to take home. the next day, we added a blend of cajun spices we keep on hand and that was the cat's meow! i would have given a 5 star rating if not for this lack of proper seasoning. we will be back but next time, we're bringing our seasoning to supplement theirs.
went here the other day and it's only gotten better! ^_^ i'm so glad business is hoppin'.house pan roast was perfect! gumbo was perfect! oysters were delicious! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is cool with cheap appetizers! i love being able to try something new, especially when it doesn't cost a fortune, just in case i don't like it. ^_~ they were all good, two different kinds of sausage with neat dipping sauces, and the calamari was made from crazy 1&quot; thick humbolt squid! i don't know if chef ritter went out to catch it himself or not, but it was super fresh! :dthe waitresses need to step up their game. maybe they need to stop worrying about who's table is who's and concentrate on checking on their customers. good thing great food always overshadows mediocre service in my book! ^_^
i have to start by saying that i took a trip to new orleans for the first time last year and it changed my view on food forever ... primarily the technique of well infused spices into dishes, especially cajun style seafood - so really everything ever since then has been compared to how well nola did it. &nbsp; &nbsp;we came around 545 on a sunday night right before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended at 600 pm and were still able to &nbsp;catch all the <span class="highlighted">happy</span> deals on drinks and small dishes (how lucky were we?!). &nbsp;so taking advantage of the deals, we loaded up on starters and tried as many little dishes as possible ... there were a couple others i would have tried (like the oysters and crab cakes and mussels) but for the sake of being greedy ... &nbsp;there's always next time! &nbsp;for starters we tried:-cajun calamari: huge portion, good crunch, not your average calamari rings - comes in long strips -new england clam chowder: creamy with a peppery kick, just the way i like it! -bacon wrapped shrimp: bacon was too crunchy, almost burnt, but shrimp was perfectly cooked-jalapeno poppers - you really can't go wrong with jalapeno poppers ... cheesy and spicy and yum!as far as main dishes were concerned, i was able to sample the seafood gumbo and the etouffee and i enjoyed both. &nbsp;both seafood dishes were well prepared, spices were well infused, and overall both were well ... tasty! the seafood gumbo came complete with okra, shrimp, crab, clams and andouille sausage served over rice in a deeply flavored stew. &nbsp;the etouffee was lighter and tomato-y with shrimp and crawfish ... yum. &nbsp;we were seated around the kitchen/bar area ... it was fun to watch dishes being prepared right in front of us.tips? come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so you can sample as much as you can ... and cheap beer is always a plus ... duh! and, as suggested by a friend, only order one main dish and share ... the portions are huge - feeds enough for two people! &nbsp;if you like spicy, don't be afraid to go spicy - &nbsp;level 5 was not enough for me ... next time i'll try a 7!it's no new orleans ... but good enough! i will be back.
mmmm mmmm mmmmmmm!! this place is delicious! my friend told me about this place after i told her i've been wanting to try the oyster bar in vegas. and omg. bomb. i went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (5-6:30pm &amp; i believe it's m-f). i got the 2 oysters for $3. they were huge! tasted fresh &amp; yummy. and i also ordered the house pan roast. ermahgerdddd. so. freakin. delicious. i felt like i was scarfing down my dish because i was eating it super fast. it was so good. it's $19.55 for dinner. kinda pricey but def worth it! it's a tomato cream based dish w/ lobster, shrimp, clams, veggies, i forgot what else, &amp; a scoop of rice. if i didn't love to eat i would be able to share but no thanks, i want my own :) lol. anyways get the house pan roast next time! you will not regret it!
my husband &amp; i absolutely love this place and dine here often. &nbsp;not only is the food incredible, but the chefs (tony, chris, jimmy) and staff are friendly and eager to please. &nbsp;we have tried many things on the menu, but our absolute favorites are the bouillebasse, house pan roast and fisherman's soup (white clam chowder soup on steroids). &nbsp;the appetizers are also great (e.g. cajun calamari, blue point oysters, bacon wrapped shrimp). &nbsp;i would definitely recommend hitting the restaurant at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so that you can take advantage of the discounts and sit at the bar so that you can watch the varied preparations. &nbsp;we love it here and plan to return often!!!!
hmm not sure how i feel about this place yet. i didn't enjoy it as much as oyster bar in las vegas but one thing i do like compared to vegas is more seating!! the bar seats about 15-20 people and there are about 10-15 other tables surrounding. same feel as vegas with the bar set-up. i came for dinner so the house pan roast (mixed seafood) was $19.95, cesar salad $5.50 and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> crab cakes $4.75. our total came out to $38 with a 18% tip. prices here are about the same - however they do have different lunch and dinner pricing - i suggest coming for lunch when dishes are about $5-$7 less!i typically eat mild but ordered a #6 for my pan roast- watch out - dare devil over here!!! :p - it was a little spicy for my liking. the pan roast wasn't as creamy with more of a marinara taste here then vegas. the food wasn't bad here, service was good. defintiely something to try out before you go to oyster bar. i set my expectations too high..
amazing seafood gumbo!!!thank you yelpers for pointing out the way to this place! &nbsp;we came on a saturday just in time for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which highlighted a few appetizers on the cheap. &nbsp;i decided i wanted something to warm me up and curious about their new england clam chowder and boy was it reminiscent of the one i had while i was in boston. &nbsp;it was delicious.i will keep this short.ordered the seafood gumbo and when our server was explaining what was involved in the preparation of their gumbo, including a 4-5 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> stock, i was drooling. &nbsp;when my dish was served, the smell the emanated was amazing. &nbsp;you can smell all the spices and the seafood that it had and it was delicious. &nbsp;it had real crab meat shredded, pealed shrimp, clams and a heaping of rice. &nbsp;i decided to take it easy and went with number 3 for spiciness and i was very <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. &nbsp;in the future i think i can take it up to maybe a 5 but that will be pushing it for me. &nbsp;the dish had so much flavor that you can actually take apart. &nbsp;the texture was thick but it didn't feel heavy like it was made out of cream. &nbsp;that would be their pan roast.service was a little more on the slow side. &nbsp;seeing how they prepare using the steam kettle, it does take some time to prepare their dishes. &nbsp;but it was definitely worth the wait.
cajun fries must try (different take on what normally fries would be).. had there jalapeno poppers which had the thickest and crunchiest batter i ever had (pure awesome). i ordered the &quot;gumbo&quot; which included huge pieces of shrimp, fish, sausage, okra and other shiznits i don't know about. full robust flavor, wonderful aromatics and everything u would want @ a really really good bayou restaurant except its in chino hills. no 5 stars cigar because... service really really i mean really slow. i suggest go during lunch time (before 3 pm) because come dinner time, the prices jump like $5 or 6 dollars.. on the flip side, if you get there between 4-6 (dinner time) <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and get your brewski (bottle) for $2.50..
two words pan roast! after venturing out into the oc with fellow yelper juliet c. to ritter's, we have been dying to try more steam kettle cooking. so after we learned that chef ritter used to work at the boiler in chino we decided to drop by for dinner earlier this week.when we arrived the wait was only about 10 minutes which was a pleasant surprise since it was labor day. we compared the menu to the menu at ritter's and realized that the prices at the boiler was slightly cheaper and they even have a reduced pricing for lunch. although, after ordering our food we also noticed that the portion sizes were also slightly less so you might actually be getting more bang for your buck at ritter's. since i enjoyed my clam pan roast at ritter's so much i decided to order the same thing again. juliet ordered the house gumbo. we didn't want to go too spicy so i stuck with a level 5 and juliet chose a level 4. overall, i felt that my pan roast tasted pretty much the same in comparison to ritter's. i also really enjoyed the complimentary bread which i used to dip into the pan roast which soaked up all the flavor. i also tried some of juliet's gumbo, but i felt that it was nowhere as good as the pan roast. the texture of the gumbo was thick and had the consistency of gravy. it also tasted a bit watered down so we assumed it was because the spice level was too low. i'll definitely come back again to try their lunch special pricing and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
shanon y. and i wanted to try this place after our amazing visit to ritter's skc in oc! chef ritter used to work at the boiler and i believe he played a vital role in starting the business, as well. in comparison, i would still prefer ritter's because it's newer and chef ritter himself actually works there, but admittedly, the boiler is still pretty damn legit. the wait to get seated was about 10-15 mins. shan and i came for dinner on labor day. get the pan roast!! i will be ordering that from now on after sampling shanon's dish (she ordered the clam pan roast). i was curious about the gumbo, so decided to order that. it was definitely good, but not nearly as delicious as the pan roast! my seafood gumbo had a gravy like taste and the consistency of a thick stew. on a spiciness level of 1 through 10, i asked for 4, but it wasn't spicy at all; not in the least bit. if anything, i would have wanted more flavor! however, the seafood was really good and the dish was tasty. it just could have been even better. shanon's dish was....amazing! taste was comparable to the pan roast at ritter's skc!! the portion sizes at the boiler are a bit smaller than ritter's, but the overall prices are a bit cheaper too. heard this place has good lunch specials and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 6pm, so i def need to check it out again soon!service was great! our waitress's name was destiny and she did a spectacular job. she was so sweet and so efficient!
amazing food! this is one of my favorite places. too bad they're so far away.came here for dinner with the boyfriend before eminem's concert.we walked in at around 5 and the place was pretty empty. it was a pretty hot day though, i would say like 100 degrees.we sat down at the bar. the head chef (never got his name) was super nice! he asked if it was our first time &amp; we said yes, he brought us out a cup of clam chowder to try. it was so delicious!! yummm my boyfriend isn't really big on seafood but he enjoyed it.we ordered the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> appetizer sampler.i ordered the house pan roast and the boyfriend ordered the cioppino.we got our sampler which had bacon wrapped shrimp, spring rolls, and sausages (we ordered the loiusiana sausage). all 3 appetizers were delicious! yummmmmmwhile we enjoyed our appetizer, the chef started to prepare our entrees using the kettle, it was fun to watch.our food was ready once we finished our sampler.my house pan roase was delicious! it comes with jasmine rice. words cant describe how good the pan roast is. i dont know how to explain it but i guess you can say it's like curry, cajun style..full of spices and fresh seafood. i think its worth every penny. simply delicious! i really want more...my boyfriend really liked his cioppino. it's pasta with really spicy seafood. i dont really like spicy so it was a bit too spicy for me but it was tasty. my boyfriend said the sauce was perfect, the spice was perfect, and the seafood was really fresh. he kept saying it was realllly good =)so me and boyfriend really enjoyed this place. i cant wait to come back soon =d must try!
yumm! i absolutely love the boiler. it really is a tasty and unique place that always has me craving for more. it might be a bit on the pricey side, but honestly, what do you expect when your bowl is loaded with seafood??? you can even sit at the bar and watch as they make your food in their special steam kettles. &nbsp;i'd rather come to this place than going to the boiling crab for some sort of cajun food any day. my absolute favorite dish is the house pan roast. ahhh delicious. the sauce is creamy, loaded with seafood(shrimp, crab, lobster, and clams), and with the right spice level (i usually get a 5-6), it's like an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. it normally comes with rice, but you can make it pasta instead, which i like a whole lot better. if you don't like shrimp or one of the things they put in the house pan roast, there are other pan roasts that come with just clam or just crab and etc. this place even has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which gives delicious appetizers for cheap! every bowl is pretty big and good for sharing. most of the time, even if i do share, i still have leftovers. if you don't want to try the pan roast, i'd say that the shrimp diablo and the cioppino are pretty delicious too. if you haven't come in and tried the food at the boiler yet, you definitely should. it'll knock your socks off!
a little gem here in chino hills! i love this place! &nbsp;this small cajun restaurant is homey at best, &nbsp;you can sit in the bar and watch the chefs cook your meal in their steam kettles. the service is phenomenal and the food is heaven in a bowl. appetizers are great, the calamari is okay- not my favorite item in their menu but the bacon wrapped shrimp is awesome and the oysters are nice and clean. their clam chowder is good, a must have when you eat here. almost everything in their menu is amazing but everyone's favorite here is the house pan roast- it's seems like every time we come here, this is what the majority eats. &nbsp;their jambalaya is amazing too! the cioppino is also good. you can pick the spice level on how hot and spicy you want them (0 being not spicy at all to 10 being burn your tongue good) they serve wine and beer- which are even better during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ($3 for wine, $2 beer). &nbsp;their desserts are good too, a must order is the creme brulee. so come check it out and you definitely won't be disappointed. this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants here in chino hills!
my partner described the house pot roast as throwing rice into a boiling crab bag. &nbsp;i like to describe it as a better version to tikka masala.let's begin by saying how much i i love indian food. &nbsp;i love their food for the abundant amount of spices to create a flavorful dish. &nbsp;for anyone who loves indian food, i can bet that their favorite dish is the tikka masala. &nbsp;if i am correct, then you will definitely love the boiler's house pot roast. &nbsp;it is another version of tikka masala... but (i'm so sorry to say this) better than tikka masala... it had a nicer blend of the spices than indian food, only because sometime indian dishes can have a bit of an overload on their number of spices. &nbsp;you can definitely taste the lobster that seeped into the rice. &nbsp;i had about 5-6 jumbo shrimps which were delicious, and the fish was a nice touch. &nbsp;i think it would've been a little better if they added sausages to it. &nbsp;my partner in crime, who also loved that dish, described it as rice put into the bag at boiling crab. &nbsp;i disagreed because i do not like boiling crab at all... but for those who love boiling crab, you can be the judge yourself.he also got the cippiono. &nbsp;we both thought that it did not go well with the pasta. &nbsp;cippiono are not supposed to go with pasta! &nbsp;however, the sauce was really good and so were the seafood. &nbsp;the sauce had a sour and sharp wine taste to it -- like a marsala (like the marsala chicken pasta at cheesecake factory). we also got the calamari, bacon wrapped shrimp, and oyster rockefeller from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;i only enjoyed the calamari, which was very thick and lightly fried. &nbsp;it wasn't chewy and was very tender to the touch. &nbsp;i do not like bacon, so i have no other comment on that starter. &nbsp;the oyster rockefeller was not as amazing as it appeared on the menu. &nbsp;i would have enjoyed the raw half oyster more. &nbsp;i would come again for lunch but not dinner because the price is a bit too much -- especially if my partner believes that it can be easily replicated by adding some rice into a bag at boiling crab. &nbsp;it would definitely save me the drive, considering how far and out of the way i had &nbsp;to make for a visit.
5 starts strictly for the fact that there's nothing else like it. &nbsp;oh, great food and service don't hurt either. &nbsp;i first heard about the boiler last year after eating at the oyster bar in vegas. &nbsp;seafood soup? &nbsp;and spicy seafood soup? &nbsp;two of my favorite things! &nbsp;i also love watching food being cooked right in front of me, so sit at the counter if you can.4 of us arrived on a saturday for an early dinner (6pm) so luckily, there was no wait. &nbsp;a hot bowl of yummy deliciousness is just what we needed after a long day of snowboarding. &nbsp;since we arrived 10 minutes prior to the end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, we also splurged and ordered the fried calamari and sausages. &nbsp;yum!having already tried the pan roast in vegas (a creamy spicy soup with rice), i went for the cioppino and loved it. &nbsp;a variety of fresh seafood over linguini in soup. &nbsp;i chose level 3 (out of 10) on the spicy radar which had just the right kick. &nbsp;(i've lost my ability to eat really spicy at my old age. &nbsp;*tear*) &nbsp;all the seafood was cooked to perfection. &nbsp;i also tasted my friend's bouillabaisse (also a 3) which was similar, but no noodles. &nbsp;i'd totally order that next time. &nbsp;i didn't try the gumbo because my friend ordered a 5 and i was afraid my tummy couldn't handle it. &nbsp;the fact that he was sweatin' bullets scared me too, but he said it was delicious. &nbsp;i was lucky enough to even taste the clam chowder, which was different than any other clam chowder i've had. &nbsp;there's a spice in it i just couldn't pinpoint. &nbsp;it was good and not too clam-y. &nbsp;eating at the counter also allows you to talk to the chef, ritter. &nbsp;he's a super nice guy and knows his food. &nbsp;he manages to handle all 12 steam pots at once to serve the entire restaurant and their take-out orders (which there were plenty of). &nbsp;they also have a bar and flat screens with the game on.it's seafood people, so it's not gonna be cheap. &nbsp;if they weren't so far away, i'd come back more often. &nbsp;(p.s., irvine peeps, they're coming to you next....)
if you've been to vegas and ate at any of the oyster bar. this place is better and closer if you're located in socal. my favorite place to go to after coming back from snowboarding from big bear.food: their calamari was good, nothing too special. maybe it's because i'm not a calamari fan, but overall it was pretty decent. the bacon wrapped shrimp tasted fried instead of baked, i'm not quite sure but it was delicious especially with the sauce they drizzle over it. my must have appetizer when i come here is a cup of their new england clam chowder. mmm the best clam chowder i've tasted so far. i tend to always come here on sunday night so it's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> time for appetizer and drinks. i recommend all the new-comers to try the house pan roast first. tastes like a creamy spicy tomato roux and it has white fish, shrimps lobsters, and clams (i believe). they serve it over rice, but i prefer pasta instead. the spice level is from 1-10 with 1 being mild. i choose 7 for everything because 5 isn't really a medium. for those returning who'd like to try something different. their gumbo isn't the best gumbo i've tasted, but probably the best gumbo you'll get around southern california go light on the spice level on this one because this one does have a lot of pepper in it to begin with. my cousin had the etoufee and he's absolutely in love with it. instead of the tomato creamy flavor it's more of a spicy seafood roux and contains shrimp, sausage, and crawfish served with rice.decor: it has a nice feel to it. it's like a modern look to it. but the best seats are the counter seats. the bathrooms are a bit small, but the restaurant itself isn't too big. i would say they could probably seat 65 people. there's a second bar for drinks, but their drink selections aren't that big.service: it's an interactive type restaurant if you sit at the counter. the chefs are funny especially chris. the waitresses are on top of their game. if it gets busy they might not check up on you as often, but if you ask any of the waitresses for anything they won't hesitate to get it for you. overall, friendly staff makes a better experience. the food does take a bit of time to cook. so if you're starving and want food to come out in a few seconds, this place isn't the right place for you.compared to oyster bar in vegas. the flavors aren't as bold (in a good way). the wait isn't ridiculous, but you might have to wait like 30 minutes if you're caught in the rushes. the staff in vegas are a bit more interactive with the customer, but they're dealing with 16 customers instead of 65.
after driving 60+ miles one way from la to play on a nice golf course in the inland empire, the boiler was a nice treat. one of my favorite go to places in las vegas is the oyster bar at the palace station hotel. that was when my friend's first introduced me to the whole steam kettle cajun cooking. some time later we got wind that such a place existed in southern california. rumors started circling amongst my buddies that a worker from the oyster bar branched off and opened up his own place in chino hills. we still don't know the real story or if the boiler has any ties to the oyster bar at all even though the concept, menu, and taste are almost identical. as you can imagine, i was ecstatic to finally have the opportunity to try out the food at the boiler.they have some weird closing <span class="highlighted">hours</span> similar to traditional japanese restaurants. check their website or call ahead or you may end up knocking on a locked door. i believe tuesdays they don't serve lunch period, mon-wed &amp; friday they are closed between the <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of 2:30-5pm, and on weekends they are opened open to close without a gap in between. they also have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, as well as beer and wine.we walked in a little after 2pm on a monday. the place was nearly empty and the waitress didn't seem too thrilled that we came in right before they were about to close. yes, i know the golden rule that when a restaurant is about to close, you should try your best to not walk in and sit down. as customers we are entitled to walk in a minute before the closing times but it's generally frowned upon. besides, i worked in a restaurant for many years back in the day so i know that sucky feeling. plus, i've been looking forward to this meal for a while. it's not that often that i find myself in this neck of the woods. however, our waitress lightened up after we chatted a little bit and she figured out that we weren't going to be those typical slow patrons. we were there to do work and gtfo. we were seated at the main bar and although the menu is extensive and everything looks enticing, we were able to pick out our food right away. we chose what we would normally get in vegas. what i appreciated seeing on the menu was that they had a &quot;lunch&quot; time portion. that meant less food but at a cheaper price. i ordered the lunch gumbo, spicy level 5 (medium) while the homie ordered the lunch house seafood pan roast, spicy level 7. the dishes were about $12-13 each. personally, both dishes were just as good as what we experienced in vegas. full of strong and intense new orleans inspired flavors, a good amount of seafood, and the scoop of rice will ensure that your belly is satisfied by the end of the meal. if you enjoy a nice tang/sour taste then i'd say go with the pan roast. reminds me of an upgraded and thicker version of tomato soup. the gumbo is on the richer side but you'll find yourself licking the bottom of the bowl. both weren't too spicy to me at all. if i wasn't curious about some of the other items on the menu for future visits, i would happily order these again.there's plenty for everyone off their menu although the majority of dishes lean on the seafood side. watching the chef make the food from the steam kettle is pretty cool and i really do believe that the food tastes better made this way versus the conventional stove and pot style. you may opt out to sit at the bar so you can witness the magic happen right before your eyes. definitely worth the stop and will be thinking about this place every time i'm in the area. a perfect meal after a long and tiring day at work or in our case, after 4.5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of hacking up a golf course.
my sister found it on yelp and she said she wanted to try it for her birthday. so we did.the reviews on yelp allowed me to have high expectations for this place.our first impression was that it was a nice looking place. the bar did not seem well stocked, but i liked what they had on tap. out of the everything we ordered, the only thing decent was the arrogant bastard we had on tap.cajun calamariit was just little slivers of meat. it wasn't the kind of calamari you would expect at this &quot;highly rated&quot; restaurant. it looked like the ones that came in the box. they were soggy, no crunch whatsoever. so far the best calamari i have had is at michael's in rowland heights.oysters on the half shellthey claim to serve blue point oysters. &nbsp;the oysters that we were served were certainly not blue point. the meat was swollen with water, it seemed like they were just injected with salt water. to someone who has never eaten oysters, they would be <span class="highlighted">happy</span> because they're getting so much meat.what they didn't know was that it was awfully bland. there was no taste. blue point oysters are sweet. &nbsp;the only good thing about their oysters, a previous yelper mentioned was that they shuck them well. &nbsp;i'll give you that. but for $16.95 for a dozen i'd rather go to the place i usually go for oysters. &nbsp;that would be the original fish company in los alamitos. appetizer combothe combo is something they have only during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it came with 2 spring rolls, &nbsp;3 bacon wrapped shrimp, and one sausage. the spring rolls were not spring rolls, they were vegetarian egg rolls. it just tasted like an undercooked filo dough with oil soaked cabbage. the bacon wrapped shrimp was served with dijon mustard was literally tasted like honeybaked ham. we went with the louisiana sausage which was overcooked and overseasoned.steamed musselsmy mother loves the steamed mussels at fish company, so when she saw this on the menu along with the description she was all for it. when the waitress brought it to her, she found hair in it. later when they took it back to the kitchen and remade it, she took a sip of the broth, which is supposed to be an exquisite reduction of the sweet juice from the mussels, white wine, sherry, shallots, and a few other spices. this was beyond the blandest soup ever. it just tasted like water with a hit of garlic and oil. my mom was so dissapointed, now we know to only trust the original fish company.house saladthe salad was romaine lettuce, red not purple onions, and avacados with a lemon vinaigrette. it was a huge helping of lettuce, but they were cut so big we had to cut the lettuce into smaller pieces. it had literally 5 cubes of avacado. the vinaigrette was not appealing, the olive oil was the good kind, but it was not balanced with the lemon and the vinegar. so for a dressing, there was only lemon juice.new england clam chowdermy sister loves clam chowder, and this one was just alright. the cream based was way to thick and there were too many potatoes it almost seemed like cubed potatoes with gravy. pan roast house this is supposed to be the most requested item on the menu. one reason i believe is what the yelpers say. when i first saw the pan roasted house, in my mind flashed a pan with olive oil and shallots and some garlic browning along with the fresh seafood all pan seared and then placed along the jasmine rice. really what it is tomato soup with seafood. if you look at the kitchen in the center and watch them cook it. they take a scoop from the cream base pot and another from the tomato base pot and stir, add some olive oil and add the precooked seafood mix. that's it. they ask you for how spicy you want it, we got a 9 and it tasted like chunky campbell's tomato condensed soup. my brother asked if they can make it hotter and the chef said oh i'll create a sauce that will take it up notch. he made the sauce, we tried it. it was not that spicy. salsa is spicier than that. if we were going to compare to the scoville units of a pepper. the 9 that he made for us would be a belle pepper. and that extra sauce with that kick would be the equivalent to a jalepeno.this place was a disappointment, and we will not be returning.
i guess this place is a great alternative to the oyster bar in vegas since its a lot closer. i have been here more than 5 times and i still am not satisfied with their food.yeah, it is good and its almost the same as the palace pan roast i had at the oyster bar but no, its not the same. i dont want to be too detailed and picky about the food but their pan roast tastes a little too sour for me. theres that right amount of sourness in the palace pan roast i had in vegas but this place is similar but its just not the same.this restaurant also takes as long as the one in vegas. why? i hate it when they are so slow and make us wait for a whole <span class="highlighted">hour</span> for our food. i was all <span class="highlighted">happy</span> when i placed my order pretty quick but i got my food exactly an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> after i placed my order. the shortest time i waited was 45 minutes.vegas is worse but why here?i did occasionally visit when my boyfriend stayed in corona for school but now that he is back here, we hardly have time to go back.decent food but you have to wait forever.
now featuring the palace station oyster bar in chino hills!!!i was turned onto the oyster bar in palace station by one of my mba friends several years ago and have introduced many of my socal friends to amazing food at the vegas 15 seat oyster bar.i'm so <span class="highlighted">happy</span> the boiler opened up in southern california. &nbsp;no more frantic drives to vegas for a pan roast craving.ritter, one of the best chefs from the oyster bar, has open this restaurant in chino hills for all of us to enjoy. &nbsp;the pan roast is only an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> drive away. &nbsp;the restaurant is only 9 weeks old however the cajun &nbsp;flavors are 14+ years in the making. &nbsp;the food is exactly the same as vegas: amazing. &nbsp;being a new restaurant, the operations are a bit bumpy. &nbsp;the chefs are on the ball. &nbsp;the food is worth the wait and you need to overlook the issues with the servers. &nbsp;the servers are a bit lost but they are trying. &nbsp;my server, some white dude, messed up more than one order with customers around me. &nbsp;food amazing: house pan roast hotness level 6 - awesomeclam chowder - awesomeseafood chipotle chowder - awesomei wanted to try the oysters however they did not have any at the time. :(definitely try it out!!!! &nbsp;for all you oyster bar lovers in socal only 1 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> drive or less depending on where you live.good luck ritter with this endeavor.
this place has gone way downhill over the years ever since chef ritter parted ways with them. &nbsp;first it's the taste and the quality of the food going down, and then the chefs there basically scoring a failing grade every time we go, and now they're shrunk their portions as well to barely enough to feed an average adult male. &nbsp;that basically marked the very last time i'll be going there.i've been very supportive for local restaurants over the years and i've been very excited to tell people about this place. &nbsp;really come to think of it, of all places they opened this one in chino hills. &nbsp;there were days where we had to wait for an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to get seated and we were still more than <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to go. &nbsp;but two incidents from my last 2 visits basically sealed the deal for us.first one was a couple months ago when i went with two of my friends. &nbsp;nothing's wrong up until we're getting our food... which almost never ever came. &nbsp;the restaurant wasn't particularly busy that day, but man... it took them over 1.5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> to get our entries. &nbsp;we're really not difficult people to please, and we don't have exceedingly high expectations. &nbsp;but 1.5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> for on a week night and what we ordered was nothing out of the ordinary? &nbsp;and the funny thing is we were not alone, as we noticed several tables of patrons all sitting there patiently waiting for their food that really almost never came. &nbsp;the flavor... well, let's just say it wasn't as good as it was.second incident was a couple weeks ago when i went with my wife for lunch. well, the chef was busy getting our food ready this time and apparently it came too quick 'cause he immediately jetted for his break and dashed out the door after sending the orders our ways. &nbsp;it's all good except our food wasn't fully cooked... the lobsters in our plates were still translucent. &nbsp;what's with the seafood restaurants in the area really why can't we just get appropriate food safe for consumption? i'm not sure how this can happen, either the chef really didn't even care, or he just dropped frozen lobsters into the steam kettles and it barely defrosted. &nbsp;either way i don't care anymore 'cause they lost my business. &nbsp;for those who might be interested, chef ritter, the original chef here has opened up his own restaurant in oc. &nbsp;i'd rather drive a little further to get appropriate food.
i've been here once - introduced by a friend to try it. i ordered the crab pan roast and it comes standard with rice unless you request for noodles as substitute. the flavor was exceptional, i had the guy who made it rank their level of spiciness from 1 mild to 10 hottest. i chose 9 and it was hot but not to the point that i loose my taste buds.the pan roast was thick and creamy full of flavor. i could not help but dip my french bread over and over this creamy sauce. overall, i think if you like cajun and seafood, it unique presentation of how the guy cooks and prepare your meal right in front (i sat at the bar) and the portion is big.my take is a for the item i had. b for its location and it's set in nowhere land. and c for its pricey nature, even for the lunch menu.the reason i gave it a 3 stars is because of the inconsistency of their business <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. i brought a friend who was visiting from l.a. over just the other day and the place was closed. not too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about it.

two words <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
yummy pizza and there is a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on sat :-)
excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices! great food the chicken nachos are delicious.. great beer selection. one of my favorite places for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
wow their mini-burgers for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are absolutely delicious..warning: you will be craving the burgersgreat service and fun people. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pizzas too!
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! lovely service and great food!
always a good time here! delicious beer and food on the late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! who doesn't love good deals?!? late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 10pm till closing!!! love this place :)
decent service...<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu has changed and there's no more pastrami sliders! they removed it from their menu.
love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. get the chicken nachos and ask for fries instead of chips!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! one of the few places in the area that have a late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or any kind of decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. love the 1/2 price appetizers (definitely way more affordable) and the chill yet nice ambiance. yard house is a chain, but a good chain.
best place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i usually go for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because their entrees are a bit expensive and not as great as they sound. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is always the best though. the only yard house that i know has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 7 days a week. i really wish they had a bit more of a beer selection like the one in san diego, but it beats all the beer selection around the area.
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials can't be beat! the food quality is excellent and the portion sizes of all appetizers are the same during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as when they are regular price. &nbsp;the service is always friendly and fast. &nbsp;my recommendations for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>:bbq chix pizzachicken nachosspinach dipspicy tuna roll
i rarely eat here when it's not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because it can be pricey, but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (every day after 10pm) has amazing deals. it's half price on certain appetizers and a few dollars off beers. examples: huge portion of chicken nachos for $5, onion ring tower for $3-4, pints of beer for $4-6. service is usually good. it is pretty crowded during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on the weekends so expect a wait (up to 1.5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> sometimes). it's also pretty loud inside.
i usually only come here for there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is delicious. great place to take a bunch of your friends and venue is at a good location. wish the restaurant was a bit larger.
pros: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> service. quality of food. atmosphere.cons: none.first off, i have only gone here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, because who doesn't like discounted beer? <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts at 3 and ends at 6 daily. anyways, i have yet to be disappointed from yh. the selections of beer on tap is astounding. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu has a variety of good eats. and allows you to order multiple items to try and taste. i have never gotten the same server twice but they are all consistent on levels of friendliness and service. good food and drinks mixed with great friends, makes for an amazing time out.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu in yard house is the bomb, i have been to several defferent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> restaurant, yard house is the best. everyone should try!!! 5 stars
this place is evil and sucks now because they got rid of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at night and on weekends... &nbsp;their menu says <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is only on mon-friday and only in the afternoon.... if they still have late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> maybe they should include it onto their menu.... used to b our occasional food/hangout spot.... the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> used b half off alot of food o well the food is still good though
they <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is worth your existence. good for groups and a fun spot for an afternoon date. everything on the vegetarian menu is delicious.
i love this place!!!! my favorite place to eat in chino! i went to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here two weeks straight! the pizza and tacos are amazing! if you have room for dessert try the smores brownie! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks aren't cheap but the atmosphere and food are well worth it.
good and service were very good. come here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and load up on appetizers. it's after 10 pm
this review is for their late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the only yardhouse that has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after 10pm everyday!. &nbsp;my go to spot if i'm bored and want to snack on some appetizers and watch some espn highlights.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ftw!!! this yard house has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> daily! yes you heard right it's daily! countless good memory happened here, good old college days, reunions, girls night out, game night, celebratory dinner, birthdays, first date and many many more!everything on the menu is good but im usually here for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cause it's so worth it!! they have so many options in terms of draft beer, bottle beer, domestic, import, fruity beer, wine, cocktails etc. let me just say there's a drink for you no matter what your preference is.they may get very packed cause full bar, decent food, tvs everywhere, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but i'm usually too busy having a blast to care about not so attentive service.pretty much everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu are good, trust me cause i've had every single item.
we love coming here for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only. &nbsp;it's our favorite place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in this area.the prices are great and the beer on tap selection is extensive.we usually just order from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> appetizer menu. &nbsp;our favorites are the hawaiian poke stack, chicken lettuce wraps, and spinach cheese dip. &nbsp;yummy and filling for a reasonable price.
definitely one of the good place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you can stuff yourself on appetizers and as much as alcohol as your body can take. the place is really comfortable and the surrounding area is safe so you won't have to worry if you are going out late.their nachos are definitely the bomb and the service are really great as they check on you quite often. i can't say much about their regular menu because i've only been there for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. parking is plenty and there are plenty of things to do in the area too.
great place to go after 10pm. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and all apps are half off. always coming here after 10pm, service is great!!
we have been to yard house several times for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and dinner. we love the the great price for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. so far we have tried onion ring, calamari, chicken lettuce wrap, the vampire taco, hawaiian poke stack, seared ahi sashimi, and we love them.the service has been great but if you go to yard house on friday and during the weekend, the wait migh be long and it may be a crowded.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, especially spicy tuna roll. spicy tuna roll - so rich in avocado cube slices and chilled for this summer appetite. love it!california roll - good but not as fascinating as the spicy tunabbq chicken pizza - great price for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>drinks - ordered a strawberry lemonade (free refills!)
my girls and i were starved, but we held out for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu that starts at 3:00 pm. we had a half priced pizza, lettuce wraps, sliders, and mac and cheese (not on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu). &nbsp;each item was tasty and well-worth the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price. &nbsp;our server was friendly, attentive, and boxed up our left overs. &nbsp;solid 4 stars on this trip!
friendly, accommodating staff. they usually let us get by a couple minutes early for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if they see we're waiting.sometimes food comes out a little slow, but rarely.
i love yard house! alcohol, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals, yummy food. :)
is there much to say about a franchise? well, they're not all the same. the good thing about this yardhouse is that they have late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day but be warned if you go on a friday or saturday, it could get pretty ratchet.it's always been a hit or miss here. food, service and drink-wise. for example, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> calamari.. it's the same portion as their non-<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but there were times the calamari came out stale and a bit cold. there were times the calamari came out in a way smaller portion too.. strange.as for their service, like i said earlier, hit or miss. for the most part, servers are professional but at times they tend to forget about your table. at my most recent experience, they forgot an order for 30min and played it off like nothing.drinks are for the most part, good here. i think there was only about 1-2 times out of 15 where my mixed drinks were made incorrectly. since they do have a full bar, they can make mostly anything you want that isn't on their menu but they do charge a premium.all in all, place is a solid 3 stars. it's great to come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...... or a forced birthday or mixer (eh...). but just keep ordering drinks, it'll make your worries go away.
yardhouse <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!!you really can't beat their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. a lot of good food for a great price.their nachos are a must and if you want to give it a little twist, replace the nachos with fries. it will blow your mind!sliders are delicious and the pizza's are solid...don't think i was ever disappointed. rarely but occasionally the food will come out a little cold...but if it wasn't for that, i would give it a solid five.
best local <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! great choices for food and beverages. service is always good. gets crowded on friday nights. my fav combo is honey blonde w/ chicken nachos. &nbsp;nachos are packed w all the good stuff! not for light eaters.
i only ever come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because it provides the best value so my review is going to focus on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - yh pretty much does the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around - for the amount of food you get coupled with the price you pay, it is definitely worth going time and time again. when i go, i always get the chicken lettuce wrap, nachos, chicken tenders, spinach and cheese dip, sliders - i'm about to name everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu - it's that good. the beer selection rotates occasionally, and they always have a wide selection - if you don't know what you like, the waiters are glad to help you and give you samples. this review applies to all their chains, not just the one in chino hills.
great service, fresh food, huuuuge portions! made it in time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and it did not disappoint! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> goodies: bbq chicken pizza, chicken nachos, ahi stack, mushroom lettuce wraps... and of course we had to get their normal dishes: caesar salad, jambalaya... basically, we got too much food, but it was all delicious!!
yard house has the most amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! you can get great food and drinks for around $5-$10!!! they give you generous portions and the drinks are delicious, especially their martini's. this is an awesome hangout place to get a big group friends together. the customer service is great. if you are not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with your food and/or drink...they will do everything to make it right. if you want a fun, cheap, and delicious <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...head over to yard house. it's also great because they have late-night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
i don't know why they made this venue different from the regular yard house. this is the only yard house &quot;bar and grill&quot; that i've heard of. the only difference is their beer selection is significantly less. i wish they had the full selection!but i'm a fan of this place because i love still love their beer selection on tap, their food, and their great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: m-f 3-6pmlate night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: sun-wed 10pm-midnightmy fav dish= spicy tuna roll (not really a cut roll. it's like a sushi cake with edamame instead of rice and avocados and cucumbers)i also love their garlic noodles!those are both part of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too!
another standard yard house location, this one has the same set up as all the others. &nbsp;service is a bit slow here but they do have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i recommend ordering the thai chicken pizza, chicken nachos, chilaquiles, bbq chicken pizza, or even something from the gardein menu if you are vegetarian. &nbsp;there are so many options and their prices can't be beat during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! parking is convenient and free at the lot at the shoppes.
it gets the job done. i only go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they have half the amount of beers that most yardhouses have. the staff is very friendly though, not sure if that's cause i go 2 sometimes 3 times a week for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
i go to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> almost every friday with my friends and coworkers! sometimes we're there twice in the same week. it is by far my favorite <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot! definitely gets very busy on friday nights so i recommended going around 930-945 and just waiting till <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at 10! service wise...these 5 stars are for servers sebastian and tyler. we get one of them as our server almost every time we go on a friday! they're always on point! even during the craziness of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. food: i've tried almost everything on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu in terms of food and my personal picks are definitely (in no particular order):1. chicken nachos2. moo shoo eggrolls3. blue crab cakes4. margherita pizza5. bearnaise slider (gardein and regular are good!)6. pastrami slider (for $1 more get it w/ truffle fries! yum!)7. fried calamari 8. chicken garlic noodles9. mushroom lettuce wraps!i know that's almost the entire <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, but i haven't been disappointed by anything i've ordered yet! other non <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items i would recommend are the deviled eggs, ripped potatoes and crispy brussels sprouts with malt vinegar aioli, the gorgonzola and mushroom burger, crab/lobster artichoke dip, lobster garlic noodles, and definitely the pepper crusted filet mignon with brandy shallot cream sauce! good lord it is delicious!!! i love this yardhouse! definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! 10pm-closing 7 days a week!
best service and fairly decent food. good place to chill, go to a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and watch some sports. must try's are truffle fries and shiitake garlic noodles. kimberlee is so sweet attentive and efficient, you're lucky if you get her! i would definitely recommend you go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, just go at least 10 minutes before the end of it. they took our names down when we arrived 15 minutes before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and seated us exactly 2 minutes after it ended.... as for drinks, try the pineapple express if you're feelin' something fruity.yummilcious factor = b+
since when does this place have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during the day?? i came here yesterday for a mid-day snack with my friend. i was super <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to find out that they had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during the day now! my friend and i shared the nachos (huge!) and the chicken lettuce wraps (our way of being healthy :p). both were around $6 each. now that i know they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> earlier in the day, i'll make sure to come more often! :)
i love this place. they always have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every night unlike most locations so i never have to worry about if they offer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or not. their food here is usually pretty expensive when it's not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but come at 10 pm and half their menu is on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> discount!! definitely recommend the chicken nachos (substitute the nachos for fries). portions are huge and delicious! great beer and alcohol selection, so plenty of options. they also have so many games and highlights playing that you'll find something you would want to watch. the one thing that gets me is that it's usually really crowded when i come and they don't take reservations. expect a minimum of 15 minute wait, but that just shows you how popular this place is.
this place is the perfect environment if u like to be around people but still like a modern atmosphere...i love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!!
this is my favorite <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in chino hills. it's the only yard house that has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every night starting at 10pm. the menu is a little different because it's a &quot;bar &amp; grill&quot;, there are some dishes that are not on a regular yard house menu. that really doesn't matter because the best place to go is during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.the service is good. the managers are always walking around making sure everything is going well. but beware, it's one of the only places in chino hills that's open past 9pm so it can get busy.the only thing i must complain about is the music. it gets too loud when the sun starts to set, that you will have a yelling contest with the people at your table.
food is delicious. can be a little pricey, i recommend to go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. :)
wanna save money?go at <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> times, everything worth eating is half off.i have never been here when it has not been <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> since the regular price is expensive.recommendations for getting during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are the bernaisse sliders or pizzas, or literally anything on the appetizer menu. almost everything there is worth it, taste and filling.if you are really hungry, chicken nachos are what you should go for.if you are one of those people who go to place, and try a kind of &quot;standard&quot; level of french fries, i recommend trying out their truffle fries, tad bit pricey for fries but worth it.alcohol: what can i say, you are at a restaurant, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> can get you a $6 goblet of sweet beer. recommend to try their lindermens(sp?).
this is my favorite yard house location. the poke salad is a must and half off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! great for everyone who love beer and good food.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every night after 10 unlike the usual sun-wed at other yard house locations!!my favs for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is their spinach dip with fresh pita chips, sliders, onion rings, garlic noodles, crab cakes, calamari, nachos, and their pizzas. prices are really fair for the amount of food you get. i'm glad that this location finally extended their menu like other yard houses. they also have pretty good lunch specials during the week.service is usually good. ambiance is chill. thurs-sat nights for <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> can get pretty packed.
i love yard house and their amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials! &nbsp;this location, though, doesn't have the best service. &nbsp;the staff were all very friendly, but i think the servers always get really overwhelmed by <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> orders that they run around like crazy and drops drinks off just anywhere on the table (even in front of a baby...). &nbsp;i wish there was a closer yard house near where i live though...
i've been here about 4 or 5 times for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i've always had a good experience.haven't had a time where the service was bad thus far. waiters are always attentive and friendly.i usually order the chicken nachos or chicken strips from their appetizers menu during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (i wouldn't pay regular price for these items but definitely worth it during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>).my last visit, i was able to get a sample of stella artois in case i didn't like it. it was pretty good and i ordered a pint of that along with the chicken nachos and chicken lettuce wraps for the girlfriend and i. $20 including tax and tip. not bad at all!honestly, i wouldn't come other than <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> just because their foods are pricey when it's regular price but it's good food and a nice, clean environment.
love this place! the ambiance is great, whether day or night. in the evening, the lights are dimmed, perfect for intimate conversation, if you prefer. the drinks are good, but can be a little pricey. you do get your monies worth though. the bartenders are friendly as well as the wait staff and hosts. the service is good and the food is tasty. i recommend trying the spicy tuna roll appetizer if you are a fan of sushi. if not, the calamari and tacos are good. great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
monday night = <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all night.idk if its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all night every monday night... but it happened to be so last night when i tagged along with a friend of mine. 8pm wasnt crowded so was seated right away and the waitress was really nice n quick when it came to service.food &amp; drinks ordered:spinach cheese dipblue crab cakeslost coast apricot wheatstop lightiono bout the stop light ($8) but the rest of the items were half off!! yay! the spinach cheese dip was reaaaaally good and id definitely get it again (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> time). blue crab cakes... make sure u eat it with a good amount of the sauce.. otherwise itll taste like something's missing. apricot wheat: fruity &amp; my kinda drink~ ^^<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> + bomb food/drinks + great service will always make my day~
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great. half off food. good quality. fun environment and everyone's <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. good beer selection and you can get a huge yard glass.
this location sucks imo. &nbsp;too small and vibe sucks. &nbsp;brea location is much better.our server at the bar didn't even mention <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;experience would have been better if they mentioned it to us.
ask for the special chicken nachos at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> times. if you like fish, get the seared ahi tuna, you'll lick the plate clean.
so i've been coming to yardhouse ever since they opened at the shoppes. i work at the cpk next door so we frequent yardhouse <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work. i absolutely love their spicy tuna roll, spinach cheese dip, and chicken nachos. my favorite martini is the gobbstopper.about 1.5 (or so) years ago they took the gobbstopper off of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu! i was pleased to find out that when requested, can still be made. i come to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every thursday night with my girlfriend who i've introduced the gobbstopper martini to, and who loves it also! tonight we made our usual thursday stop on a wednesday since this was the day our schedules permitted-- and guess what?! apparently &quot;a couple of years ago&quot; you could get the gobbstopper on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but definitely not anymore. uhm hellooooooo -- i get it every single week! i even pulled a couple of servers that have served me previously to the side to ask them &nbsp;now don't get me wrong! i wouldn't mind paying 10.50$ for the martini regularly. but the fact that they tried to make me feel stupid by saying you haven't been able to order that on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for years frustrates the hell out of me. i would give no stars for this experience if i could.
love coming here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> especially for their chicken nachos! i substitute the nachos for fries because fries are betterr than nachos in my opinion. the portion is hugee so it's really great to share amongst big parties. i also love their pizzas. just a side note, their spicy tuna roll isn't your average cut roll. it's literally just one big circle of layers of the sushi ingredients. it's a layer of rice, spicy tuna meat, avocado, seaweed, and so on. same goes for the california roll. &nbsp;however, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is really a great deal and everything on the menu is delicious! their miami ice martini is really good too and super pretty. the bartenders were also great serving our drink at the bar. however, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> does end up gettin pretty busy so service can be a bit slow.
this is the go to spot hand down! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every night after 10!? you can't go wrong there. &nbsp;not only is there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food delicious, but so is the beer! &nbsp;i frequent here often and not once have i had any issues here. &nbsp;good job yard house, keep up the excellent customer service!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. bomb. i came here with my girlfriend, and dinner during hh came out to be $14 for the both of us. all of the appetizers are half off, but i forget the alcohol specials. i guess it's pretty evident on what i am more concerned about.bottomline: the food is really good, and the pizzas are awesome. the nachos are giant too! with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, you can't beat any place else!
its all about <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.this place is great but the restaurant need to turn on some more lights sometimes (but i understand if they want the kind of atmosphere). all the servers are great, but the one that i usually get is a guy named corey is he pretty cool and is very courteous. things to try if you are new to this place:-chicken nachos (ask for them with fries instead) which are only 5 bucks during - &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>-blue crab cakes are awesome-chicken wings (firecracker glaze)
i luv this restaurant for 2 things: they r vegetarian-friendly ( they have a whole section in their menu for veg foods) and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazeballs!!! only thing is that theyr olways packd on <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> so...it took too long for booze n food to arrive
we love it here!!amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> .never had a bad meal here.good food, great beer and wine.kids love it! nice staff, good manager, music is fun.
they have the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! great food, great drinks, and great services! you should really try these during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>:+ spicy thai chicken pizza+ turkey sliders+ chicken nachos+ bbq chicken pizzafor some reasons they tend to be busier on thursdays, you might have to wait a little. but other than that, they usually seat you pretty quickly. the only downside is probably the high noise level; it gets really loud and might be kinda hard to keep a conversation going.
the one time i get something other than the appetizers, it was not that great! the surf and turf burger was not worth the price in my opinion.i think i'll stick to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and appetizers from now on.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 3-6pm, 10pm- closeselected appetizers and pizzas are 50% off. beers and cocktails are also discounted.their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> selections are very limited. there is not much to choose from, but it's great for the price!we went at 3pm and we didn't have to wait for seats, but i'm not sure if it's the same at night. their food was average, but i'm sure most people come here for their beers. our server was friendly and attentive.
really enjoyed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;got the onion tower for only $5 and the chicken lettuce wraps for $7. &nbsp;totally worth it and delicious. &nbsp;we couldn't finish it all. &nbsp;my husband got a bloody mary and was thrilled it comes with bacon and a shooter of beer. i got the miami ice martini and it was strong, but good. &nbsp;would definitely come back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;not sure everything would be as good if i was paying regular price. &nbsp;nothing like saving some coin and tasting good too.
(this review is based on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only!!! )went here on a weekday last week w/ the boyfriend n his lil sis for some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food..we were pretty starving and we each ordered 2 things from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. lol (yea we were really hungraaay) coming for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a pretty good deal b/c most of the appetizers are 50% off!!! i highly reccomend ordering the bearnaise sliders for $5.95 it's totally worth it..the sauce is super tasty and the sliders are served up w/ a big side of fries. we also ordered the spinach dip, spicy tuna roll, ahi sashimi, calamari, and fried chicken tenders. the tuna roll is so-so...it's not exactly a roll either but it's different b/c its like a stack at the bottom is cucumber sunomono salad, then a layer of edamame, a layer of the spicy tuna, and topped with a layer of fresh avocado. the calamari is pretty yummy and the fried chicken fingers are tasty too.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is mon-friday from 3-6 pm..this yardhouse location is pretty small and located at the shoppes at chino hills..so i would imagine that on a weekend for dinner this place probably gets pretty packed...so for me, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best bet! =p i did notice that they do have a number that you can call ahead to put your name in for a reservation though..if you don't come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> though..two of my favorite things to order: the ahi tuna sandwich or chicken garlic noodles(ask them to grill the chicken instead of havin it minced...sooo yummay)
when it's late at night, and you don't want the normal fast food. it's either oke poke or yard house!! love love love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here. either 3-6pm or their late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which is 10pm-close. the usuals we get for food are the chicken nachos, sliders w/ truffle fries($1 extra... but worth it!), spicy thai chicken pizza, or kung pao calamari. &amp; not all those in one sitting! for the drinks.. my fave is their rose garden &amp; black velvet. rose garden = hoegaarden white &amp; lindeman's framboise. fruity and light. :) black velvet = cider &amp; guinness. downside is that sometimes.. our food isn't cooked the way we expect it, or like it. examples: when we ask for well done truffle fries, &amp; they come out not at all crispy. brussel sprouts w/ sauce on the side, &amp; they come out drizzled in sauce. but other than that... love this yardys!
food quality and service is the same as other yard houses around but gotta dig the large variety of beer they have on tap everyday! parking is abundant cause it is in a mini-mall area and isnt too crowded at times. &nbsp;pricing for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is cheap compared to the regular prices. &nbsp;service is excellent and staff is very friendly!best thing about this yardhouse is that they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> daily and not just on the weekdays so going for a drink on the weekend with friends isnt gonna break your wallet.
never had a problem here. good service, &nbsp;good food and drinks. &nbsp;hangar 24 orange wheat on tap. chicken nachos, turkey sliders and wings are my preference. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pizza and beer are also great too.
i love yardhouse!the late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best! 1/2 priced appetizers from 10-close every night! foods great, service is great, and you can always sit at the bar and watch the game!
likes: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best and happiest time to come. &nbsp;spicy thai chicken pizza and hawiian poke stack are pretty good. &nbsp;the surprise birthday chocolate molten cake and ice cream was super awesome! :)
an updated review for this place is long overdue. i'm surprised that i gave this place a 1-star so long ago. what makes this place a winner is their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is an awesome deal. half-off most appetizers, reduced prices on pizzas and sliders, and drinks are much more affordable.i strongly recommend that you come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (mondays - fridays from 3pm-6pm). i love their firecracker chicken wings, the chicken lettuce wraps, and the spicy tuna roll. the wings have this nice savory asian kick and are deep fried to perfection. the lettuce wraps are fresh, cool, the chicken is delicious, and the 3 sauces they provide (peanut, soy sauce, and sweet &amp; spicy) are wonderful. their rendition of the spicy tuna roll is unique and delicious! it's like a cucumber and edamame base filled with spicy tuna, caked with a layer of whipped avocado, finished with radish, sprouts, some seaweed flakes, and their red shredded red cabbage. there's no rice involved!their chicken nachos, chicken strips, and calamari do not disappoint either. come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with some friends, share the food, and you will love it!
good: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices and selection, have late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> alsobad: wait time and hostess we came across before where she quote us 15min but end up 50mins waitbeer selection is good, food is not consistent enough at times, service is ok a lot of times server get side track with other bigger parties.too bad this yard house is a smaller one cause they sure could use more space to minimize the wait time.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. all yard houses don't have the same menu. this one by far has the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in the la/inland area. its monday through friday 3 - 6 pm and everyday after 10 pm. not many vegan options, but hummus and dip is always a solid choice. save your appetite for the yard!
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> any night of the week from 10pm til close. i wouldn't recommend ordering the mac 'n cheese because the portioning was way too small for what i paid.
i love this place! there are few restaurants open until 2 am and yard house is one of them. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing, from drinks to food and to appetizers; are discounted during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! my boyfriend and i are literally here about every weekend and not once do we ever feel rushed to leave. very comfy and relaxing environment.
go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> between 3-6 pm. &nbsp;drinks are always good and there's no crowd. &nbsp;i ate their turkey sandwich and pizza with my beer. &nbsp;the server was friendly and i enjoyed after lunch meal with friends at the patio.
this is a very nice yard house. they have a very comfortable patio area, plenty of booths inside. i think it's a little smaller then the one in brea, so they can fill up fast. yard house has the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you should try to go and try it out.
i definitely recommend going to any yardhouse for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. half off selected appetizers, pizzas, sliders and drinks. the first time i went i ordered the chicken nachos and ham and pineapple pizza. the nachos weren't bad, but the ham and pineapple pizza was really good. it's similar to cpk's pizzas, only it's half off! it's probably not worth going when it's not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if you're craving pizza and buffalo wings or onion rings. their buffalo wings are fantastic, too! for a dish that's half off you still get 10 wings. talk about not skimping on the wings!their service is great. the waiters here never look angry or upset and they have no problem bringing you condiments or extra napkins. the food comes out pretty quickly, too. i'm not big on drinks, but i've tried their classic cosmo (which was slightly too strong for me) and their pineapple express (which i didn't like at all because it was way too strong), plus it's not one of the half off drinks during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. boo.other than the fact that their regular menu is a bit pricey i recommend going here whether it's the 3pm - 6pm or 10pm - closing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> :)

my friends and i have a favorite beer, petrus aged red, and this is the place to get it on tap. we come here mostly for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which (for us anyways) is from 10pm-close every day. pastrami sliders and the onion ring tower are amongst the favored shareables. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here makes the food and drink prices worth it, otherwise it can be pretty pricey.i would give it a 5-star rating but the amount of service versus how busy it gets is very lacking. many times when we go and it isn't all that busy it still takes quite some time to get our drink orders taken and fulfilled.
great for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i like the different martini selections, even though they're a little on the sweet side. &nbsp;since people have already commented on just about everything on the menu... i'll rate the clam chowder, which isn't something you would normally get here. &nbsp;it is gooood! :)servers are pretty attentive here.
customer service is so good here! it was my first time &amp; boy was i <span class="highlighted">happy</span>! we went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &amp; so we got some pretty good stuff. the menu for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is pretty good.i ordered the mac n cheese that they have. bomb dot com. it has bacon, chicken, mushrooms and just a whole bunch of yummy in it. we also ordered, the truffle fries, sweet potato fries, sliders, bbq wings, and chicken nachos. yea, we're fat - we know.i loved everything about it &amp; i'm definitely coming back!
i came here with my lovely family. we came for my dads birthday. it was the first time for my dad. i have come here many times for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and for birthdays.we all ordered very different entrees. we also got drinks. my dad got me a mango mojito which was delish. my dad got wine and he definitely seemed to enjoy it. my over all experience was great. they did not make us wait for too long which was good. i would definitely go back for more. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing. they have a lot of options and the appetizers are great.
i like this particular yardhouse because it's the only one i've been to with a daily <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. yes sun-sat 10 to close. whooop!sliders...to die for, always a staple when we go grab drinks here and of course, this is where i was introduced to the infamous truffle fries...yummalmost every other yardhouse i've visited has yet to live up the truffle fries here, so it definitely does depend on which one you go to.i don't live anywhere close to here (i'm originally from riverside and go to school in irvine), but i am always willing to drive the 30 minutes just to enjoy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here.
this place has a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it's one of the few bars with 2 <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> a day, and one of them being at 10:00pm. great selection of beers and half off a few appetizers. it can get really crowded, so come early if you want to sit at the bar. try the big sky moose drool if you like dark beer.
we came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;great prices and even better food. &nbsp;the watermelon &nbsp;margarita is a must it's &nbsp;amazing :) try to get lisa she was a great and attentive server. &nbsp;i would come back here just because of the service!
great food, friendly staff, and nice atmosphere. love the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day after 10pm. highly recommended
good beer, good friends, good times! notice i didn't mention good food? cuz i've pretty much never eaten here in the 673736293 times i've been here. stick to drinking i say. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends at 6 now (lame!) but late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is always appreciated (10-close) since not much is open late in the area...well except for the dennys across the street (its open 24 hrs btw) haha eat there instead!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only:yard house is still one of my favorite chain spots for good ol' <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it's always spacious and with plenty of tvs for all games. they have a vast array of solid appetizers available like spinach cheese dip, sliders, pizza, wings, lettuce wraps and more. the list is so extensive! always have a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> belly after.service is always friendly and parking at this location is usually pretty easy unless you go during peak <span class="highlighted">hours</span>.see you yh when i need to unwind with some friends!
i was here for a friend's birthday. it was during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so they had half off on all appetizers. i was seated at the bar area that was surround by multiple hd tvs, which was quite entertaining and fun. i ordered the bbq chicken pizza, chicken nachos, buffalo strips, and house amber which most definitely satisfied my drunk munchies. the ambiance was low lit and very romantically social. the service was prompt and responsive at the bar. drinks were refilled 2/3 in. overall, it was a good place, good environment, and good times.i would recommend coming here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to set a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> mood :)
gotta love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i just come now and get everything ordered before six. &nbsp;whats nice is that even at 5:30pm, there isn't a wait...i just keep going with their calamari, sliders, and pizzas. i didn't like their poke stack but that's just me. &nbsp;servers always seem to recommend it.
me and some girlfriends were in there last friday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and our bartender scott was awesome and very attentive. he made us a great holiday drinks that had us asking for more. there were even some generous patrons who were in the spirit of giving which made the evening better :) this is one of our local hang out spots where the girls and i meet up and have a good time. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best time to go, that night our bar tab was about $25 for the two of us and we were there for about 5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. spicy tuna roll and seared ahi salad are some of my favorites.
my husband and i came here late sunday night because it was the only place open still serving food (that wasn't fast food). the place is super loud, so dont go here if you want to actually hear the person across from you. the menu prices are a bit expensive. but luckily we came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. jackpot! appetizers (full size)and pizzas are 1/2 off and sliders are $6.50. we ordered the calamari and pastrami sliders. they were both excellent. &nbsp;i would definitely come back during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.update: we came again and ordered the margherita pizza to go (fyi, no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing on to go orders). i loved it!
a really great spot for hang outs with friends and having drinks. i usually go here during the weekends, gets busy at nights but i enjoy the environment. they have a large variety of alcohol drinks. music is loud there, but it's all apart of yard house. i also have to conclude their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. there are many selections to choose from. but overall, if you like to have a good time and like to eat and drink during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, this is one of my favorite spots for that. it does get busy most of the time and sometimes waiters are slow, but that's just a few down fall but i still give them five star.
this is as good as it gets in sh-tty chino/chino hills. &nbsp;sadly. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is packed because there is nowhere else to go in this town if you aren't a serial killer.
got my food order down by johnny vegara and already knew what kind of beer i like. stone ipa fyi. the dude analyzed my like a hawk. i've never see that type of service before. he even knew what type of appetizer i wanted which was the sliders. great place to go to with friends especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. probably the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around to have a good time.
for as big as this restaurant is service here is sucky. we arrived here at 930/945 we have had 4 different waiters. i do give then credit for there drink prices during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. we ordered there fried calamari extremely rubbery and kind of cold.
alcohol - full bar, great selection of beers on tap. really impressed by all the beer that they have on tap, they also have good house brews.food - i don't think i've had something here that was &quot;bad&quot;. all the food is very consistent every time i've come here. nothing is really spectacular but if you come for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, both regular and late night, they are pretty good deals.i usually only come here for the late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 10pm to close. pretty good deal, couple dollars off brews and half price appetizers. i like the spicy tuna rolls, the pizzas are not bad and the parmesan fries are good! usually sit at the bar and the service is always nice, even when sitting at a booth the service is good too.overall, can't complain about this place. really good and consistent with beer!
tilted-kilt-chino
really good time today. heather and monique were great bartenders. only complaint is the lack of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> value on the food side. enough choices in the area that the food prices should be more inviting for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. beer and &quot;scenery&quot; is great!
went back again. they have improved the speed and quality of service. i love the hoppy/<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. the ambience is awesome and celtic sported bar to the next level.
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals on appetizers! &nbsp;the flatbread pizza and chicken quesadillas are amazing and the homemade potato chips are great! &nbsp;girls are classy and sweet.
went there for super bowl! the waitresses are really hot! no minimum charge for the great game which is good. just a bit annoying when they trying to do the raffle during the super bowl ads. they mute the ads and do raffle in house. we cannot enjoy the super bowl ads. the food and drinks are good. price is fare. during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> even better. we have lots of ppl, so ordered all of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. the whisky beef is the best.
good sports bar with tons of tv's. we were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the beer selection and good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. the service was relatively good and everyone was very friendly. the wings i ordered were very tiny and not filling at all. *good beer selection*poor food options*great for sports events*average to good servicewe will be back again for football sunday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. unfortunately we will have unch or dinner before we come for drinks.
best service from jamid at the bar! must sit at the bar and have some great ice cold beverages and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!! great entertainment!
went to have drinks with the wife. the experience was great. service was awesome. always had a cold beer in front of me. never a empty glass. the garlic fries are off the hook good! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was fun. new things to try off that menu. if you want a fun environment go here!!!
great service at the bar from bartender jamid! nice place to hang out for a couple beers. good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the irish dip was tasty. i'm sure i'll be back again
i came to the tilted kilt because i had a coupon for free irish nachos, and good thing they were free cause if i had payed for those things i'd be pissed- they were greasy and flavorless. my black and blue burger was dry and unsatisfying. my mom really enjoyed her blackened chicken flat bread however. i give them 3 stars because the ambiance is relaxed and causal, a good place to grab a beer (they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>) and our waitress sasha was sweet and attentive. i'll probably go back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and steer clear of the irish nachos this time.
this place was super!! the food was delish, the beer was (non-alcoholic) excellent, and taylor was the best server of all time. she made us promise to return for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. and dinner. and breakfast... ;)
the girls are super pretty! but the service was horrible! food was good. we came <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>..etc etc. but the server lied and said it was 7 dollars but the tab turned out to be way more. shes stupid.
oooh my goooood fix your sound system. tvs cut out every 5 seconds.why does it take me 20 min sitting at the bar to get another round at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> when it's hardly busy?seriously tho. just turn off your sound system until it's fixed. this is horrible.
jenn is the cutest and has the best customer service in this place. i will definitely come back at least twice a week just because of her awesome service. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is worth coming for and the food is great. hooters is a thing of the past. long live tilted kilt.
first of all shout out to our awesome waitress camille. great customer service, give this girl a raise. i'm a big fan of the tilted kilt. reasonable priced beer and the best boneless wings anywhere. &nbsp;i suggest the tilted sauce on those boneless wings. i've had other stuff here too and it's was all very good.bring the entire family, no problem here for babies or grandmas, its super friendly environment. great <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, before 7pm and after 9pm. like this. just learned they serve breakfast. i must investigate and update my review.
this is my second time going to tilted kilt in chino hills. my first time was decent. this experience today was awful , not only was it awful but it had a lot of attitude. the minute we sat down we decided to order our( free text messaging garlic fries).the minute we sat down our server seems very uninterested in serving us food but very pushy to serve alcohol. she told us that the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu was only with the drinks listed on the table. trying to skip around the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu listed or (hoppy <span class="highlighted">hour</span>) as they call it. stating the prices was really no different then the regular menu. and that the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> went back to the drinks saying that was the only thing that was the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. i had to explain to her that we had already looked at the menu and we're going to order at 3 o'clock but first order and enjoy our free garlic french fries and when <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts we will order from the menu. (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was 25 mins away and we were there to watch the game)we ordered our food at three and watch half the world cup soccer game only because service was not so good. our food came out but not all of it , she then said oh and got the remaining order for us no big deal ... i understand its busy. we eat then asked for a bill since we are ready to &nbsp;go. &nbsp;our server charged us for the free french fries and i mentioned it shown on the bill. she then told me that i didn't show her the text message which i had showed her and clearly remember showing her to order our free french fries . she then said oh ok i'll take it off the bill but only after i showed her the text. service is crappy i don't even drink alcohol the food felt like left overs with sauces and put fusion style with major confusion to the dishes and it sauces. i had decided to mention it to management and she rushed to find me and asked me where my bill was since i took the check book and asked if i was going to be talking to a manager. i kindly told her that i had the bill and yes that i was going to just talk to the manager about a few things. she then rush to ask me if i had found the manager yet or if i had already asked to talk to one as if she was interested in helping me. &nbsp;i had then explain to management her service and also &nbsp;typically when people order on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu they tip more at times at least i typically do. &nbsp;i also told management that i can understand the pressures of working with an environment .i told management that they might want to tell the server that some people do tip: larger when ordering at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menus at times also that i wasn't trying to get her fired from her job. very inexperienced server but the management was great. he &nbsp;took care of our check and gave us 2 $5 gift cards on top of it. i left feeling satisfied, yet felt &nbsp;that the service wasn't worth compromising to make another complaint. i don't know if i'll come back.
only been there twice. they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-6, and from 10-close (11pm?). i'm not sure if that stands for every day or just weekdays. for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they feature $1off beers and $3 well drinks. both times i came here were after 10, which is when they close down their kitchen, so i have never had any of the food. they do last call 20 minutes before 11pm, and both times they had to wait for us to finish our drinks past closing time. we had one beer each (pretty big selection of beers both on tap and bottled) and two well drinks (rum and coke, cranvodka, etc..) and spent only like $30 or so which is really a great deal for 4 people. the first time it was a monday night and the bartender was a tall girl with black hair who took a while to take our orders but she was very friendly and had a kind smile. the second night ( tuesday, the following week) it was a shorter girl with black hair and tattoos who seemed to be closing up early. although she wasn't rude, she wasnt friendly and was trying to rush us and we felt as if she was trying to get us to leave. we had a better time the first day than we did the second. i haven't gone back since, but i could consider it, since their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices were appealing. they have a lot of tv's, so if there was a game on, you have many places where you can turn to watch. the bar was maintained neat, and i particularly remember noticing how clean their restroom was. not bad for the price, but i feel like i haven't really explored the full tilted kilt experience. maybe next time i'll come in during their mid day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so i can try the food.
i was there for the big title fight and clippers game at the same time. despite the huge crowd and tight seating my service was excellent and special commendations to the bar tender bryce who always made sure i was taken care of . the atmosphere is cheery and the food delicious. you cant go wrong with the flat iron steak salad . its marvelous. &nbsp;and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> grubs food is downright tasty . the shepherds pie a winner ! easy parrking, close to the 71 freeway and a great staff !
so my fianc&eacute; being scottish we decided to finally try the tilted kilt. we were ready for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and some football. we were seated right away, then waited.....and waited......and waited. basically we were there 20 minutes, and never once got a be right with you, here's some water while you wait, nothing. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended at 7pm. and we were there at 5. but given the fact we never got helped <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> would have ended by the time we got anything. its a shame. there menu looked good. we got up to leave and thats when we were followed out with, &quot;why are you leaving?&quot; really??? we have been sitting for 20 minutes, only to see the busboy checking his hair out in the mirror. the gave us money to come back and eat again. but do i really want to go through that again?? we went to dillons and got served right sway, sticking to dillons, yes its further from our house but its worth the drive to get great service. maybe one day ill venture back, but not any time soon.
good food, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 7 pm and good service. our server was jazmin and she did a good job. still learning the menu, but, that's ok bc they haven't been open long.  &nbsp;give this place a try. the poor reviews, in my opinion, aren't fair bc they haven't been open very long. like all restaurants, they are working out the kinks.
every year my mom and aunt take us to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to apple bee's this year we decided to try a new place. wow very impressed food was very good. super friendly staff even &nbsp;girls that were not our waitress came by and checked on us. one waitress bree was awesome she came vy we were bot her table did not know her and she got to know us. locef it here will be back for sure.

this place is like hooters but really nothing like it. this place is a irish pub restaurant. this place is the mecca of all sports bars because it's also a family restaurant. excellent selection of liquor and beer. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is where it's at at this place. all day everyday from 3pm-7pm &amp; 9pm-close. $2 appetizers, can't go wrong with that. ask for beer cheese, it's amazing. having a burger and buffalo wings are a must here, it is a pub after all so try bar/pub food. they also can pair a beer with your burger, that's pretty awesome. they show pay-per view events with a $5 cover fee. services is excellent. women dressed in kilts serving you. it's more of a family oriented vibe than hooters. hooters is a vein of my existence. tilked kilt is the new hooters with everything better especially the food, 100% better. very clean. extremely recommended.
went to the tilted kilt for the first time today. it was their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;their domestic beers, some on tap, and a couple ciders are included (the angry orchard is really good).the ambiance is a lot of fun. tons of tvs if you want to watch the game. the wait staff is very friendly, and will come and sit with you at the table, and chit chat along the way. &nbsp;(&agrave; la hooters). natalie waited on us tonight and she was a lot of fun. &nbsp;the rest of the wait staff was always ready and willing to help as well. the food was good. &nbsp;good portions. prices are good. &nbsp;my wife got the blue cheese burger, and she thought it was a bit on the salty side. &nbsp;overall though the food isn't bad at all, but it also isn't anything out of the ordinary. &nbsp;i'm glad they opened up a new hang out place near. &nbsp;we'll likely add it to our rotation.
the food we had was okay at best. &nbsp;we stopped in for &quot;hoppy <span class="highlighted">hour</span>&quot; on our way out to the dodger game. &nbsp;we texted in for a code that got us free garlic fries and we ordered the rest off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and split it up amongst us. &nbsp;the waitress was nice, but at the end she did not take the garlic fries off the bill (sidenote: i have been to this location before with somebody who has texted in for the free fries and they did not remove it from the bill that time either... i was told by our waitress last time that management tells them not to inform guests of hidden costs like for sauces, i will bet that management tells them not to remove the fries until they are told to fix the bill). &nbsp;overall, i am just so completely unimpressed with this location. &nbsp;we had close to every item on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, and all the food tasted meh. i don't understand what is wrong with this location, because i have never had any problems and the food has always tasted fine at the location in orange.
we waited 15 minutes before we got up and asked if we can get a waitress. &nbsp;there were girls standing around and sitting at tables but nobody wanted to help us. &nbsp;the drinks were $8 and the beers were $7 and it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ($4 for bud ). the garlic fries were greasy and the food wasn't good and they charged us extra for ranch. &nbsp;a restaurant shouldn't charge for condiments - no other restaurant chargefor ranch except fast food. &nbsp;very expensive,bad service and bad food. &nbsp;i may &nbsp;try it &nbsp;again for sunday football because of all the tv's.
first of all, heather is the best waitress. i came in with my coworkers after work on friday and she greeted every single person with a genuine smile. she then told us some awesome jokes and brighten up my first experience here. we also hula hooped which was really fun. the fries here are awesome! i couldn't stop eating my coworkers. the chips with nacho cheese and tabasco was tasty too. we came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so all draft beers were 3 dollars. this place gets compared to hooters a lot, but tilted kilt is definitely better. there are 3 large tvs so you can watch all the different sports you want to. the decor is very irish and bathrooms are pretty clean. i give this place 5 stars because their service is awesome and the waitresses are really fun. food is decent for a place like this. heather is the best!
great experience. we were in town to photograph a wedding and needed to hit up a best buy. as we pulled in i saw the restaurant and have heard good things about it. for a friday evening it was busy but we were seated right away!our waitress michelle was frigging great. not only was she beautiful, she was super friendly and took care of us! i orderd some aps since it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the corned beef and cabbage spring roll. sounded better than it was but still, ok. also orderd the irish poutine... yummy!!! fries, cheese, bacon, and this sweat yummy gravey... perfection.!my boyfriend orderd the shepherds pie for his main course and i got the irish stew. both, perfect! it felt and tasted like good home cooking! male sure you leave room for dessert! we got the white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie (hot right out of the oven) with &nbsp;ice cream on top! yummy!all in all. good food, great service, beautiful women,..(and men too... one guy walked by with a kilt on a almost fell out of my chair.. hubba hubba!!!!)
last night, i came here to meet up with a friend and based on my experience, i'll skip a return visit or even suggesting it to friends.  we came in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the greeting i received from the hostess should have been my warning for what was to come from the rest of this experience. &nbsp;i was told i could sit anywhere, but they didn't even offer to walk me over to the bar. i sat down in a place that i thought was the bar, only to realize that it wasn't. &nbsp;but the thing that really bothered me, was that we sat there for almost 5 minutes and nobody came to check on and/or welcome us. &nbsp;thinking we could get some better service or even acknowledged, we moved to a couple seats at the actual bar top. but even that did not work. &nbsp;we had to flag down the female bartender just to be acknowledged. (side note: an employee working behind the bar stood right in front of us 3 times and said nothing to us.) i asked a waitress for a knife and she never came back. &nbsp;i asked someone else and was told that they tend to run out of knives, so they make utensil set with just forks and quite a few people may get one with a knife missing. and that i should check my friend's silverware set for my knife. ummm, no...how about just bringing a new one out.seems like the staff only favor the male patrons. might as well, put a sign at the door saying, &quot;gentlemen only establishment&quot;. i will gladly go spend my money somewhere else, where they give the same attention to all of their patrons.food wasn't memorable and the beer was depressing.
i love that we finally have a tilted kilt in chino. i went to the one in santa clarita first after my boyfriend told me about it. the one in chino has tons of tv's and projector screens so that no matter where you are sitting you can see the game or all the games! the bar and the community table also look like a really fun places to sit and hang out with everyone. the only thing they don't have that the one in sc did was a pool table, which would make this location even more awesome. the food was also pretty good, it's a lot of bar food, and even though they don't have too many vegetarian options. my favorite food is actually the garlic truffle fries, they are so good! they have a good beer and drink selection as well, and now finally a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! service is also really great, the girls stop by often to ask if you need anything and always have a smile. i recommend this place to watch a game and chill with friends.
so ive been here for an 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> and ive had to ask twice to get served the same drink by two different bartenders. making excuse for your co worker is unacceptable this is your tip man!! tip: manage your bar better and stop making excuses for your co workers dam it!!!! im a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> drinker and will tip generously if you do your job correctly #imdone
stopped in for &quot;hoppy <span class="highlighted">hour</span>&quot; with my friend and was very disappointed. &nbsp;i'll start with the food and then get into the service.we ordered off the &quot;hoppy <span class="highlighted">hour</span>&quot; menu. &nbsp;we got the celtic poutine, whiskey beef and one of each of the offered sliders (one grilled meatloaf and one pulled pork &amp; bbq).their own menu describes the celtic poutine plate as an &quot;unholy mess&quot; and well, you can't sue them for false advertisement. this plate is just that, an unholy mess. &nbsp;nothing in this plate unifies it. instead of using a cheese that melts all over those fries they use white cheddar cheese curd (which just sits as clumps of cheese atop the dish). &nbsp;the sam adams boston lager demi glace is sweet (and to me, didn't work with the dish) and it pools oddly at the bottom of the dish, leaving your last few fries a soggy mess. &nbsp;this is the one time i wasn't <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to see bacon on a dish as the fries were already over salted (i mean, i get it, you're a bar, and salty dishes make people thirsty, so they purchase more drinks but please, too much salt might kill a man, you know?).the waitress warned me the sliders were small, and boy were they! not only were they small, they were unimaginative. &nbsp;simply meat between two mini hamburger buns. &nbsp;a little coleslaw added to the bbq pork slider and/or a slice of cheese added to the meatloaf slider would have given them some character. &nbsp;both sliders were equally and sadly, dry. &nbsp;again, i get it, dry makes me thirsty, but if you're going to make me thirsty, check on me every now and then and see if i'm parched, won't you?this brings me to the service portion of the review. &nbsp;if you're going to brag about all the beers you have on tap, please make sure you know what you actually have on tap. &nbsp;we were told they had a goose island 312 wheat on tap and then, without even asking if it was ok to swap it out, we were given some other goose island beer. &nbsp;all we got was a &quot;here you go, turns out we didn't have 312 anymore so i got you this other goose island beer.&quot; excuse me? it would have been nice for us to choose something else.if i really want to gripe (and i will), i hate being served beer out of plastic cups. &nbsp;this is a bar and grill. &nbsp;the furniture and decor is nice, but you can't serve me a beer out of a clean glass? i don't expect a goblet, snifter, tulip or weizen glass....but at the very least, a regular old, run of the mill shaker pint will do. &nbsp;i want the thickness of the glass to act as a buffer zone between my heated hand and that cold inebriating beverage (plastic just won't do).after our beers were served and our orders placed, we received an obligatory, &quot;how's everything?&quot; from our waitress. &nbsp;we had to ask for a set of silverware and napkins (i hate having to ask for napkins!!!!!)we did witness a group of women walk in and walk directly up to our waitress and start chatting away so i assume we got neglected because she was preoccupied. lastly, my chair was broken...well, the seat wasn't affixed to the rest of the chair. i wish we would have stayed across the street at applebee's all night instead of deciding to be adventurous and trying something new.

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4pm-7pm! sliders (4 small burgers) for around $4-5, fries, wings, chips, drinks for cheap!our server was great. she made sure we had everything we needed and always came back to ask if we were doing alright. oh get the hazelnut beer! it's yummmmy
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is pretty good, free chips and salsa. my friends and i only go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, the burgers are good- nothing spectacular, its the bacon cheddar fries and pints of stone ipa that keep me coming back.
my wife hates this place because they don't give you fries to go along with your burger order. &nbsp;i wouldn't care for it either except that their burgers and their appetizers are good. &nbsp;what makes it even better is that during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, all appetizers are 1/2 off. &nbsp;heck, we just sit at the bar, watch the lakers play and stuff ourselves. &nbsp;i couldn't think of any other way to enjoy dinner. hah

came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. had a great time. nice ambience. each kid got sketch a pad to play with. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> requires seating in patio or bar only. server, michelle (with glasses), was especially tentative to our needs. made our dining experience all the more better.
eh, the food here is very greasy and quality isn't good. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is filled with non appetizing filler foods. their grilled chicken bay sandwich isn't that great here. the food here is just overly friend, oily and salty. the decor here is very nice! loved the decorations.
good service. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> exists on weekends. we walked in on a saturday night during dinner <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and were able to self seat at the bar and be served right away. prices not too bad. ribeye ordered rare is truly rare, but gristly.
pleasant ambiance, great food, comparable to wood ranch in the shoppes. going you for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> i write defiantly recommend the chicken pot pie soup
come see russell! amazing service and love his enthusiasm. check out their phenomenal <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu everyday from 11-6 and 9-close! everything is delicious. especially the margarita. haha! love this place!
yum! railroad camp shrimp is the best! great pasta and the potato soup was delish! service was great and friendly. we'll be back. heck, we may become regulars. good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too!
had the filet &amp; lobster tail and it was great, top shelf margaritas and bloody mary was on point, after a few more beverages my dd drive us home. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 9th till close!
customer service is beyond great!! our server jojo was so kind and helpful. she went through the menu with us and was very attentive. the salads are delicious and the food is good too.cheesecake is yummy!<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials are so so great. the atmosphere is good too.
i've been here a few times. if you plan on coming here i recommended ordering off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. they have a lot of good appetizers and these decent sized burgers for 5 bucks with a side. unfortunately i can't say the same good things about the actual entr&eacute;es. the steak here is mediocre at best. i feel like i can grill a better one myself. the chicken wasnt bad, but wasn't anything to write home about either. the ribs seemed like they may have been purchased at a grocery store down the street. i can honestly say that the mashed potatoes were the best part of my meal. i'd come again, but only if its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i would like to note that the service was great!
came here for dinner tonight and absolutely loved it. russell was our waiter and the bartender (noelle??) were amazing. russell walked us through the whole menu and even offered us <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. my michaelada was delicious. this place is very affordable, but you can't beat the service. i could even taste the wood fire in my meal. because it was our first time there, he let us try a bite of cheesecake. it was really creamy and definitely hit the spot. will be coming back for more <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> and dinners because of amazing customer service. thank you tahoe joes for being a place where customer service still exists, rare to find nowadays but very much appreciated.
my wife and i stopped by the other day for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sat at the bar. first time here.first, the atmosphere was pretty cool. the decor made you feel &quot;woodsy&quot; with a hanging canoe and wooden furniture. really liked it. we sat at the bar and ordered 2 drinks and decided to have death by appetizers. we ordered one of each appetizer that ranged between $2.99 to $3.99 which is what <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> should be. domestic beers were a few bucks and i think an import beer, (tall) was $6.50 give or take a few cents. we got our drinks and waited for our food. out it came and the sliders were the best, awesome. loaded fries were good but since we don't eat cheese, it was a waste to order. not their fault. wings were solid and my wife really enjoyed the camp shrimp (or whatever the shrimp plate was called.)we ordered another round and finished the appetizers. the bill came to $45.00. when we are in chino hills, this will be our <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> place for sure.everything was perfect except one thing... the bar selection for liquor is a little limited. would have liked some different infused vodkas like cucumber and such, but that's just us wanting the world.
this restaurant was recommended by some friends. my family and i enjoyed every aspect of the restaurant from the food, decor, and service. our server (markay) was awesome. great salad, soups, apps, main courses, kids menu, and cheesecake. not to mention the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food menu, absolutely incredible! try them out, you will enjoy it.
returned for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> several months later. decor and design of restaurant is all it has going for it. it's basically sizzler quality food. if you like sizzler, rolling 7-11 food or crapplebees then this place will slide right in safely at 3rd base for you. if you enjoy good quality well thought out unique food this ain't it <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review. 4-6pm had steak sliders, the cheeseburger. &nbsp;5pm tuesday the restaurant was 15% capacity and yet the service was still slow. bartender conversation was awkward and all about him, odd? lol. &nbsp;the food? meh.... low quality fatty steak, horrible soggy fries and a mediocre cheese burger. &nbsp;the decor is very nice and open, refreshing, gorgeous patio. but you can tell the staff is not experienced or trained well i.e. i asked for steak sauce and i kid you not she asked me &quot;a1, cholula, sriracha or worcestershire&quot;. lmao. &nbsp;done
i finally found my favorite thing on their menu: joe's steak sliders with a side of their grilled green beans. sad thing is, they only serve the sliders during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and they are not on their regular menu, thus, the 3 stars. &nbsp;if tahoe joe's made that change to their menu, we'd be visiting more. so, come'on tahoe joe's make this girl <span class="highlighted">happy</span>!
my first time here today. staff was very friendly and the food was yummy. they offer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 2pm so got some apps: spinach artichoke dip, string onions, and the big shrimp. all very yummy and filling. for lunch i had the chicken pot pie soup which was very delicious along with the peppercorn sirloun with mashed potatoes and veggies. my meat was a little dry, but i'm used to eating more rare meats so that could be why. also tried their mudslide which was super good? would love to try this place again in the future :)
i love tahoe joe's! everything is amazing: steaks, chicken, juicy and delicious, it's took over almond wood. they have a killer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with cheap wings, tacos, sliders, jackpot nachos, camp fire shrimp are amazing. great salads friendly and fun bartenders, as well as amazing drinks, a great beer selection, all accompanied by unbelievably beautiful building!!! p.s the tableside baked potato topping service it's the best!
good food. i love the buffalo wings. i like how they have a toy for the kid to play with. and the fact that it's not an electronic device. however we got a server tell us no <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> on sundays. then manager said there is. then server said the manager fixed it for us. ok what? made it seemed like we forced it? what the hell. i'm sorry but the server just brought that star doown.
today i went and tried this because i was in the mood to try something new. it was so fancy perfect place to take someone on a date! the food is mouthwatering best steakhouse by far ive ever been too. i ordered bbq. chicken that was so tender and juicy,cane with the best mashed potatoes and green beans, and my boyfriend ordered ribs that literally fell off the bone! the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity you receive. i am definitely going back! :)yay for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>
only went once, but first impressions do mean something. i made it clear it was our first time there and we needed time but the server just kept hovering . (and not in a helpful way.) i got the burger and it was really good, but my wife ordered the steak and it was dry. the place wasn't crowded either so i thought the server should have been more attentive. at first she was hovering but then she disappeared and she never came back to refill my $4 tea. ripoff! my wife wants to give the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> a try, but i'm on the fence.
my first visit was awful. &nbsp;we were never seated after being quoted 30 min and waiting 2 1/2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. &nbsp;my second visit was better, but while the service was great, the food was nothing special. &nbsp;the cheesecake was worth the visit! &nbsp;third visit was better. &nbsp;cool <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals and the manager went out of his way to make a small problem all better. &nbsp;bought a whole cheesecake in between visits for a bday party and it was a huge hit! &nbsp;visited again on sunday night. &nbsp;sat in the bar. &nbsp;the service was amazing! &nbsp;the food was great. &nbsp;the pumpkin pie martini was so good! &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy</span> to be able to improve my first review.
came here on a friday night with my family. took a while to get us seated because we were a party of 9. i love the decor which really reminds you of being in a cabin in tahoe. we had 4 kids with us which is why we chose this place because they had a kids menu. our server was extremely helpful and nice. i had bacon wrapped shrimp with pilaf and it was excellent. it took a while for the food to come out which was not understandable because by the time we came the dinner crowd had already died down. overall, i would come here again for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or lunch
we tried this place 2 weeks ago and had to go back yesterday. it will become one of our &quot;go to&quot; places for great food! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu runs all day with drink deals and appetizer deals. but, the regular menu is awesome! aged beef (28 days minimum), the shrimp is divine, &nbsp;the baked potato is like a football and they bring out all the fixins to do right at your table! frank, the bartender during the day, is a gracious host. very knowledgeable about the menu and all around great guy!bon appetit!bob
first time coming here with my fianc&eacute; and service was excellent. we came in during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and ordered the house appetizer, railroad camp shrimp and the buffalo wings. for being the house appetizer it was only average nothing too special. i ordered a margarita that i didn't finish because it was super sweet. when my shrimp scampi came out the white wine sauce was to die for. it melted in my mouth. my fianc&eacute; order came, petite gorgonzola fillet, and oh my goodness, order this! not to mention the mashed potatoes were extremely flavorful. overall, great experience, beautiful ambience and a great date night! recommend this restaurant to anyone. (shout out to chase for being an excellent waiter. very helpful and descriptive with the menu.)oh and the homemade cheesecake was the best cheesecake my fianc&eacute; and i have ever had!
came here on a saturday night and decided to sit in the bar area to take advantage of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. we were seating promptly and then proceeded to wait for our server. unfortunately this was the theme of our evening.....waiting for our server.the sad thing was is that she spent the entire evening outside on the patio area at another table that was directly beside ours, only separated by the glass window. it is very frustrating to see our server through the glass laughing it up and having a great time at our expense.i'm sure the restaurant on the gentlemen's shirt she was chatting with all evening &quot;joey's bbq&quot; doesn't understand the meaning of customer service either since he felt it was okay to chat with the server instead of letting her do her job. i won't be going to that establishment now that i witnessed this.i was really hoping this new restaurant was going to be different than all of the other concepts that have tried out this location. it seems as though the location is cursed and nothing can succeed here.just take a look at all of the other reviews. they all point to poor service which means the owner needs to remedy this or they will continue to loose business.the food itself was actually good. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials were great (sliders, nachos) but when the service is this bad, the whole dining experience suffers.
the peppercorn sirloin was pre-cut and the sauce was peppercorn not the steak. the steak was a little cold due to it being pre-cut &amp; served on a cold plate. the mountain mashed potatoes were okay and the green beans were good. they just went for looks when serving vs function. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only consists of $4 22oz &nbsp;domestic beer &amp; $1 off others but good prices on food; they state they would like everyone ordering food to order a drink. nice atmosphere inside though.
been there 2 times already good experience both times a little pricey but standard among steakhouses of that caliber 15.99 for a steak salad. they have late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 9 til close. you won't be disappointed with the quality of meat. service a touch slow at the moment but they are busy! so it's understandable. i'm going back much more to try.
we have been here for dinner several times now and the food is better than we anticipated. &nbsp;they promote the railroad camp shrimp appetizer, but it's so crispy/hard that i don't really enjoy that one. &nbsp;what i do like is their appetizer salads, prime rib, side baked potato and a mai tai (one of the tallest glasses and sweetest i've tasted). &nbsp;their cheesecake is absolutely fantastic - very rich and new york style. &nbsp;i'm not even a huge fan of cheesecake, but this one is insanely good. &nbsp;all of the friends and family i've taken here really like it - but they love that cheesecake! &nbsp;the staff is super friendly and attentive also.the bar area is nice if you just plan to come in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and they also have a nice covered outdoor patio too.
came here for lunch based on a recommendation of a business associate that had hit the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> a couple times.first off, 70 minutes in-out for lunch is too long.not sure if there is a staffing issue or what but i saw 5 people total when we arrived and 8 total while we were there. long wait for each interaction with the waitress.(who seemed nice, hence the 22% tip )the food was hit &amp; miss @ best. grilled chicken that was dry on overly hard bread, soggy under cooked fries. steak sandwich that was average and the bright spot of the visit, a blue cheese burger, also will crummy fries &nbsp;(tip to mgr., when you see three big guys at a table, and you stop to ask how it was, notice that no-one has come close to cleaning their plate)i wanted to like this place and the d&eacute;cor is very nice but, chino just simply has too many choices for a good lunch to settle (and pay) for this.i may visit the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &amp; try the prime rib slider i've heard about but then i wont have to get back to work inside a <span class="highlighted">hour</span>.
was there on a tues evening, love the fact that they have two <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>; 4-6pm and 9-close. i tried most martinis on their menu and they were delicious. the decor is amazing! love that you can smell all the real wood as you walk in the restaurant. the food was simply incredible! i love that they prepare your baked potato table side. their steak is slow simmered so don't expect to get a steak on the &quot;rare&quot; side. we had both the cheesecake with fresh strawberries and the chocolate cake at our table, they were both to die for. the staff was great, friendly and very accommodating. will be back...hopefully real soon!
went on a date here and wanted to try something new in the chino area.have to say the place is very nice giving you a similar vibe as lazy dog, really good ambiance.the food is just okay. we ordered a steak sandwich and steak salad and started with calamari. while the ball and chain only had water to drink and for myself a ice tea.boom $48 bucks. yikesif the prices were similar to applebee's or chilis i would say good deal. but the steak on both plates is not just worth the price. calamari was very rubbery and wished they offered some type of sauce to dip.also we were overcharged for a drink we did not orderi really do not think we will be returning unless &nbsp;just drinks during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
been wanting to check this place out and finally did. a really neat restaurant. great decor and ambiance. &nbsp;the &quot;dinner for two&quot; promo they had was more food than we could handle. we will definitely return to try more on the menu. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials were also pretty good so might need to try that on my next visit.
1st time. read good reviews. &nbsp;had the joe's steak along with baked potato and rice and green beans. &nbsp;best steak ive had in my life. &nbsp;thick and juicy and tender. &nbsp;decor was ok. &nbsp;baked potato was topped off with optional bacon , chives, cream or butter. &nbsp;delicious food. &nbsp;waitress was very friendly, informative and attentive to our needs. &nbsp;would check up on us every so often..manager even introduced himself and asked if everything was ok.. would definitely go their again but next time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. &nbsp;yay
i only have one thing to say....thoroughly check your food. my husband bit into a nacho chip and immediately stood up and went to the bathroom. assuming he was done, i had them take the food away, thinking it was bad or something. therefore the concrete evidence was gone when he returned. my husband is 99% sure that there was phlegm in his nacho appetizer buried under the toppings. the chip he had was dry except for that unmistakable consistency... i won't get into the specifics, as it's making me nauseous to type this. the place was a ghost town. we were under the impression that the entire staff was trying to get out of there early as they were cleaning everything. it was 9ish when we arrived to try their 9-10 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.not to make a huge scene, we left and my husband called and spoke with the manager who apologized and offered gift cards. we declined for obvious reasons. why would we come back here for more food?!?!?spitting phlegm in someone else's food is horrifying and could transmit diseases. it's disgusting.we did not deserve this, my husband did not deserve this. he is the last person in the world who would complain about food, service etc.tahoe joe's, monitor your staff!
went here at 9 pm on sat night with a friend. &nbsp;little less than 5 min and we were seated in the bar area. ambience is bright and could be associated with nearly any restaurant, &nbsp;nothing to really set it apart. &nbsp;15 min after being seated we finally got a waitress to come by our table. ordered a couple appetizers off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu to try them. &nbsp;nachos and wings. &nbsp;nothing special about either, just avg. both of us ordered the ribeyes, mine med - rare and my friends med. when they arrived i was struck by 2 things, &nbsp;they were exceptionally thick and lacked the very tender section found on almost every ribeye i've ever had. mine was cooked correctly but lacked much flavor from lack of marbling. &nbsp;my friend's was cooked med on one end and very well done on the other. &nbsp;the sides were forgettable. the only saving grace this place had was our server was very nice, &nbsp;knowledgeable, &nbsp;and quick on the refills. &nbsp;i'll stick to woodranch for awhile till this place gets its act together.
as i sit here at the bar, i write this review. first, the place looks appealing. i was super excited to give it a try. i came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> expecting to be &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy</span>&quot;. it was everything but a &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy</span>&quot; experience. the bartender was rude, or maybe just overworked. idk. either way i thought i would give their &quot;skinny rita&quot; a shot. this thing was anything but skinny. reason being is because the bartender didn't put enough liquor/lime juice in it and proceeded to fill it up with soda. no where on the menu did it say anything about soda being added to the drink. when i asked about it, he said it was standard to put soda in the margarita. i told him then it really shouldn't be called a skinny margarita. to make a long story short, tahoe joes was not a good experience. i'll be speaking to the manager on my way out.
been here a few times now and thought i should say something about this place. i have tried many of the menu items here including steak, fish, and a few bar &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; special items. all has been a little above average except the double rack rib's and the cheese cake. both excel at what they offer. rib's meat fall off the bone and the cheese cake, well is just great. both are enough to share if you're not starving. parking is plentiful, &nbsp;on the negative side there is no wi-fi here (and they said they don't plan on getting any). great place for couples or family. it can be a bit of a challenge if you're physically challenged as getting around with a wheelchair can be tight but do-able. i recommend tahoe joe's.
first time here at tahoe joe's, it was a speer of the moment decision that my mom and i took. a key thing i have to say is the service was awesome! we were greeted and seated by kelsey she's such a sweetheart. it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so we took advantage and tried everything. our bartender noel was very knowledgeable about the menu which as guest we appreciated very much. at another point we were also engaged with another bartender justin who's very outgoing and friendly personality also gave great advice about the proper way to enjoy their sierra mary's that's served with a side of ale which is extremely good by the way. last, but definitely not least just would like to give a shout out to the management team annessa and russel truly genuine people who appreciated our feedback about our experience. the friendly staff that works here is definitely a reflection of them. i recommend this place to anyone who's looking to enjoy a sit down chow down with quality customer service and food with the modern cabin feel decor and a fireplace to match! ***the cheesecake is an absolute must don't leave with out trying it! -tamiko and jasmine
we visit tahoe joe's every so often and i am always <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with their service and food but today they were way off course. stopped by for a bogo lunch offer i received from their members club. service was at a snail's pace. the patio tables were disgusting, food in the cracks and do not look like they have been cleaned. they need to rinse them down or put place mats down (check out pics below).it took 15 minutes before my guinness arrived and that does not include the wait time before i &nbsp;ordered my beer. my rule of thumb is beer first and food second. i finished my salad before the beer showed up. i had to ask for water twice. there were no table settings for us, i don't mind asking but it can be annoying when your food is dropped off and the server runs off. beer finally arrived and we were given table settings to enjoy the food. of course, no salt or pepper at the table. i ordered the 6 oz sirloin with green beans and mashed potatoes, wife had chicken sandwich. food was great like always we just didn't appreciate being treated like second class citizens. i wasn't asked if i wanted another drink (i did want one but no one came by) and i wouldn't have ordered it anyways because i wanted to leave within the next <span class="highlighted">hour</span>. &nbsp;the computers were down so maybe that had something to do with it but still not an excuse. just because computers are down does not mean service goes out the window. taylor our server was nice but not what i am used when it comes to service when we eat at tahoe joe's. not sure if i will come back. plenty of other places to spend money and get better service.

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!
jacks is a great host as well as courtney, and the avacado rolls are amazing, especially combined with buffalo wings in my perspective. didnt get any real meals because of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, when all shareable appetizers are $2 off. how great is that!
i love bj's but their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is crappy. -$2 for shareable appetizers, -$1 for draft beers, and 50% off personal pizzas. not the greatest discounts and the portions seemed tiny. i'm on a mission to try all <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> in chino hills. so far, ra sushi and lucielle's is much better. too bad they don't hav bj's honey blonde or pale ale.
i like the beer....i like pizza...i like ice cream atop of a warm cookie. i also really love a good cheap <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i currently frequent bj's for the nutty brewnette. service here is what you'd expect from a chain restaurant...when it's good it's really good...when it's not so good...well...it's not so good. the pizza is pretty good for a chain restaurant....do i crave it...nah...do i refuse to eat it...nah...i have no complaints....but if it wasn't for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and that nutty brewnette i don't think i'd frequent bj's....
love this bjs location. we always get seated right away. if you go to the bar area be sure to arrive early if there is a popular sports game on. service is always excellent. very attentive staff. great customer service. go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sit at the bar. can't beat half off on mini pizzas!
there's nothing over-exciting about this location. u usually go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> now that ive known they don't actually brew their meet onsite anymore. mini pizzas are good value at hh but overpriced during regular times. service has been hit or miss with more misses at might since they seem to cut servers before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
they are testing a new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu which doesn't seem to be going over too well. their beer has even increased in price from 4$ to $4.50 only $2 off shareable appetizers &amp; flatbread pizza.1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas. no more mention of well drinks but a 1$ off cocktails and draft beer as well as glass of wine. if you were to compare the old &amp; new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu it is a little vague &amp; will keep the servers busy answering questions. i preferred the old one because you didn't need an actual menu to see the shareable appetizers it listed them on the table and under each price range. service is good at the restaurant and food is good. bar is great as well. lunch menu is worth it or sharing pizzas during dinner. hopefully testing will be over soon.
if this was a few years or so back, bj's restaurant &amp; brewhouse would have been 5*. &nbsp; today at most 3* and this why:1. &nbsp;although the chino hills location is newer compared to covina, covina used to have brew operations. &nbsp;if correct, many bj locations a few years back brewed on site. &nbsp;this is no longer the case. &nbsp;now, all beer is shipped in from a single location.understanding this was a business decision, it thwarted the local brewers ability to make many great &quot;one-off&quot; offerings. &nbsp;i remember getting a beer that may only be brewed in covina for example. &nbsp; local brewers would experiment with different concoctions which is no longer the case. &nbsp; chino hills (which did not brew) may be the closest location to me, but it was the unique offerings that led me to go out to covina and other locations. &nbsp;i actually enjoyed visiting multiple bj's within the region. &nbsp;2. &nbsp;bj's killed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu about a year ago. &nbsp; one thing that my family enjoyed about <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was they had a solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu with great offerings, portions, and price. &nbsp; this is not longer the case with a menu change last year with many items we've enjoyed scratched! &nbsp;also portions were cut down to size with price increases.3. &nbsp;about a year ago, bj's took away my number one item i loved on the main menu; the open face chili burger with wedge cut fries!if not visiting bj's for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and resorting to the main menu, i always got the open face chili burger. &nbsp;the piranha ale made chili was &quot;bomb.com!&quot; &nbsp;the only time i can get chili now is during lunch with the giant stuffed potato or in a sourdough bowl. &nbsp;both very good, but it's not the same as having that open faced chili burger i loved so much.all these changed happened right when the chino hills location got up and running. &nbsp;i recall the server in chino hills stating that chino hills was a test place for the so called &quot;crappy&quot; new and more healthier menu. &nbsp;bj's wanted to change their image ... personally i don't know why? &nbsp; maybe they wanted more of a wine crowd.ok, on to today... my family and i frequent bj's at least once a month (used to be 5-6/month) mainly for a change up from other now better gastropubs and the seasonal beer offerings which two of my favorites are the pumpkin ale and grand cru. &nbsp; i can drink their grand cru daily; it's that good if into belgian style of beers. &nbsp;their pumpkin is always solid, but since going to consolidated brewing i recall one year they had it forever while another another they ran out fast and we missed it.consolidated brew operations don't bother me as much the menu change last year. &nbsp; it's really the menu change; especially <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, that caused my family not to frequent bj's as much as we used to. &nbsp; as i write this, i still can't believe they killed what was an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as well taking the open chili face burger off the menu to make way for more healthier items. &nbsp; when drinking a good beer, i want hearty good beer food. &nbsp;with that menu change they should be making wine instead of beer; seriously!bring back the old bjs! &nbsp; bring back the open face chili burger at least! &nbsp; how can you scratch something that was made with your own beer product. &nbsp; if i want something more healthier, i'll go a few buildings down to souplantation!
best thing about bj's ... <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. most hh in chino hills end at 6pm, bj's ends at 7pm. the down part is hh is only in the bar area and if you don't get there early or are not aggressive, you won't be able to get a table.
went for late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the food was decent, the drinks were good, and the service was great. as a group we ordered boneless buffalo wings(kind of a small serving and the chicken pieces were small) mini deep dish pizzas(always good from bj's)and potstickers(kind of soggy) lemon drop martini tasted like cleaning solution, irish root beer was delicious and the strawberry mojito was tasty. for dessert we shared a beignet(tasted super doughy and nothing like what it usually tastes like) and an oreo pizookie(always good). our total came out to $75, not a real good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price- we could've gone to yard house and gotten all that plus more for half the price. our server jamie was very attentive and did a great job.
i came in becuase i got a coupon in my email for buy one entree get one free. they didn't even ask for it lol. overall everything was great ..<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices were great and service was very attentive. my only complaint is that i was served obviously bad seared tuna....the server promptly brought new stuff but the fact that it was served to me in the first place makes me wonder. i will return but might opt for the pizzas (which have always been amazing). that and the pazookies are worth any wait :) i would recommend this one just not entrusting the serving of quality under cooked food ...... pizza and cookies all the way!
if you've had bjs at one place, it's the same at any other chain. &nbsp;so as far as service, this place was pretty great. &nbsp;lively and fun atmosphere, especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and because it's football season the bar area had plenty of tv action... &nbsp;and beer... phenomenal... i'm not a beer drinker at all... so waitress gave us 5 different beers to sample for free before ordering. &nbsp;their fruity beers were the ones that appealed to me. &nbsp;so the seller for this place is great service and free beer (samples)!
bjs chino hills - you try so hard to create an attractive entertaining place to eat, drink and watch sports. yet, your kitchen royalty messed up our <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> meal. bjs in irvine is much better in comparison.i didn't expect an extra order of salt with my mediterrenean (chicken) pizza...and who stole the chicken go? there was some leftover bits! we tried to finish it and even picked out the salty olives, but there was no saving this pizza! :( &nbsp; the boneless chicken wings weren't much better....luke warm and soggy. at least we managed to eat these. the advocado egg rolls can't be faulted...highly edible.the evening shift might be the trainees. it might be the salt-<span class="highlighted">happy</span> chef. whatever it was...it was very memorable. in a bad way. best stick to bjs irvine.
pizza review: bj's is &quot;ok&quot; when it comes to pizza. they're about the only place in chino hills that serves a deep-dish pizza, but they don't make it right. the crust is way too fluffy and there's too little sauce to classify it as a real deep-dish. a true deep dish has a regular or flat crust, with toppings piled in the middle, coated with cheese and sauce. not here... it's like a regular pizza, but with a fluffy crust and limited sauce.atmosphere is nice and dark, usually playing 80's music. lots of tv monitors showing the various sports games. staff is usually excellent and friendly.they have a special <span class="highlighted">happy-hour</span> appetizer/drink special in the bar, sun-thu, after 10pm.
this place is great to go watch the laker game or any sporting event. they have a bunch of tvs at the bar and then random tvs all over the restaurant.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 3-7 p.m. monday thru friday and after 10 p.m. i think on all nights except for friday and saturday. their beers are a $1 off and their appetizers are cheaper too. i usually come here for the beer, the jeremiah red is the best one. there's a ton of these all over, but i usually prefer the chino hills location because i think the server's are great here.
i come here to hang with friends sometimes. perfect if a game is on since the bar is right there in front of a few huge big screens. haven't really indulged into their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu yet, but they do have a good selection of house beers on tap. the red is pretty amazing, and if you want something syrupy around 10%, go for the tatonka stout. their spaghetti here is pretty damn good and so are the nachos. the few things i would change with this place (which probably isn't possible with the current layout) - their bar area needs to be a lot bigger. it takes a good 20 minutes of waiting sometimes to be able to snag a seat up on that level. i would also suggest they do what yardhouse does and rotate some local micro brews through their selection of beers on tap. this place doesn't tend to get as crowded as the local yardhouse, so maybe a good alternative on friday and saturday night.
great americanized food with one really super dessert. yes there is some hit and miss in this place but when you order right you will be a definite fan. decor: standard but their tvs is not my taste. i wish they were bigger and more spread out especially for game day or laker day. the one in the middle ( of the bar) splits the game in 6 screens showing different things (usually sports related) but i only like that for football not basketball. we are socal people, im pretty sure most people watch lakers than regular sportscenter or nascar. the bar is pretty spacious and to get into <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, you have to eat there. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 3-7 on weekdays, sun to thurs 10pm to close. 1/2 off mini pizzas; 2$ off sharable appetizers &amp; classic sliders &amp; $2 off flatbread appetizer pizza. pretty good but i like half off appetizers like the other <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> i been to (ie yardhouse) busyness: went on a holiday monday around 330pm. very fast to get in or out. gone here on weekends, pretty crazy. that's why i usually avoid this place unless i'm really willing to wait around. food: love the scampi pasta! i usually order this and you can request a side of panko bread crumbs if you like. i love putting extra panko bread crumbs. they give you a lot of shrimp and their portions are great for their food but you will usually need a box unless you're sharing. some good choices: avocado egg rolls ( heard the cpk one is better but haven't tried it) gourmet mac and cheese spinach dip great white pizza strawberry splash drink did not like the chicken marsala. so bland. bj's favorite (pizza) was pretty good but i don't know if i call it favorite. pizza gets kinda generic sometimes. but last but not least do order the pizookie. i enjoy this so much everytime i go. it's a must and i feel like i die and go to heaven i eat here. i prefer though when they kept the pizookie in one tin and not splitting it into two smaller tins though when you want to split the flavor. you have to dig and everything gets crusty at the bottom of the smaller tin and it becomes harder to get the rest of the cookie =(. they give a lot of ice cream with the cookie which is awesome. i hate when they don't give enough. i like the white chocolate macadamia nut and the classic chocolate chip. for someone's bday they will give a small pizookie but boo no more singing. service was really great and they check on us multiple times. however it wasn't busy so i dont think they are always like this.
usually go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after 10pm. i like it better than yard house. it's good for a quick bite, drink, &amp; dessert!drinks:- strawberry splash: good tropical drink, not strong- raspberry lemon drop martini: a little stronger but love the sugar rim =)- non alcoholic: orange cream soda is another yummy option. free refills!usuals- gourmet mac and cheese: its from the small bite section, but portion is actually decent &amp; filling- bruschetta: nice and fresh- spinach dip: my fav spinah dip!- pizza: great white or spinach&amp; artichoke. not authentic deep dish pizza but still tastey.dessert- white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie!!- the oreo is pretty good too. place is chill. couple tvs-no sound though. service is okay. better than some other bjs i've been to.
been here for a birthday dinner last friday and i have to say, service was great, food was good and the drinks were well made. &nbsp;it was my niece's bday and she had a large group of high school friends come out to celebrate with her. &nbsp;the group was a good 15 plus. &nbsp;there were adults too, but we took over the 2 booths next to them. &nbsp;the hostess was really good at saving the booths for our group, since more came than expected orginally. &nbsp;since everyone was paying for their own meal, there was no problem splitting the check here. &nbsp;the waitress, i think her name was courtney, was great. &nbsp;she was really on top of things and very attentive. &nbsp; &nbsp; bj's chino hills is a good spot for groups and price is reasonable. &nbsp;they have a mini appetizer menu with prices ranging form $3-$6 bucks. &nbsp;they're good with late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too, from 10pm to close. &nbsp;too bad it's not available for the weekends.
one of my favorite places to go for a good dining experience. i will keep my review short sweet and to the point. one of the best places to me to come when you first turn 21 to have a first time drink. they offer great classic cocktails and of course there own brewed beer. i enjoyed my first time coming her and ordering a flight of beer tastings and discovering very good examples of different styles of beers. the waiters have a good knowledge of these and other beers that are not there own at the bar and are good and making great suggestions. my absolute favorite is beer is the nutty brewnette always have that every time i come in. along with this they have a great variety of different styles of food from a traditional burger to freshly baked pizza. i always recommend people going during there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> since they offer many discounted items including special on there house beers.overall, i enjoy my experiences and will always come here for the overall experience. cant wait to visit bjs again soon.
went here with a large group of classmates. terrible service, our waitress was incredibly rude and had an attitude, she wouldn't give us <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices because we didn't sit in the bar area even though the waitress that seated us before said we could because we had such a large group, she refilled our waters one time, food came out late and cold like it had been sitting out and when we confronted her about it all she said was &quot;we're really backed up&quot; (it was a monday night), the waitress wouldn't split the check for us and on top of all that, two of us got food poisoning from the spinach!! never again. next time we'll stick with yard house. they always have great service and great food.
also smaller in size than the average bj's, and no brewery here. &nbsp;i see a trend...from the outside, that lucille's that is opening also looks mighty tiny compared to other lucille's. &nbsp;i really think that chino hills city planning may have something to do with this. &nbsp;anyhow, i will now move on. &nbsp;i promise:this bj's is really pretty, and i love the setup. &nbsp;apparently, lots of people do, because it is always packed. &nbsp;the entire section of the parking lot is always full. &nbsp;sometimes i feel like every single person in this bj's decided they's drive themselves and there is literally one car per person in the restaurant. &nbsp;the bar area is tiny; barstools, one row of hightop tables, a row of small booths and like, 2 group booths. &nbsp;then there are 2 dining areas. &nbsp;one that can potentially be roped off for groups and parties and such. &nbsp;there is also a completely different window and waiting area for takeout orders- they get their own little nook.the wait on the friday night we went was bearable, since i'd already reached and passed my point of starvation and was now in the hunger-denial portion of my night. &nbsp;we were seated and proceeded to order drinks. &nbsp;i gave my extremely choosy drink order to the extremely friendly waitress and when it was gross the first time around, she made sure to get me another so it would be right. &nbsp;i do appreciate this, because for me, drinking a pint glass full of overly sweet liquid is not an option. &nbsp;my boyfriend had already eaten, and so i just got the balsamic glazed chicken. &nbsp;it was so good! &nbsp;i loved it. &nbsp;i asked for no mashed potatoes, i just wanted some sliced tomato on the side, and girl, it was the best quasi-salad i have had. &nbsp;chicken was so tender and juicy for breast meat, and the onion straws over top were perfect. &nbsp;so good, i can't believe i'm still talking about bj's, land of dishwater mashed potatoes and soggy banquet vegetable mix.i like bj's, especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with long islands in pint glasses. &nbsp;so, i am <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about this opening so close to the bf's house. &nbsp;we'll surely treat it as we do any bj's- - it's there when you need it.
wood-ranch-chino-hills
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if your on a budget our server luke and busboy were very attentive and answered all our questions thank you great staff
this was my first ever wood ranch i ever tried out on the recommendation of my girl friends. we were all in this area for work and they suggested we meet here at wood ranch for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i want say <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is mon-fri 3-6p. we had about an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to take advantage of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special by the time we arrived. seating in the bar area wasn't too bad around 5p.spinach-artichoke dip $5- it's a small portion and we felt the dip was salty. they give you a lot of chips though (chips don't look homemade) fresh guacamole &amp; chips $5- again, tiny portion of guacamole compared to amount of chips they give you. the guac was ok but nothing specialkiller wings $5- they let us choose two flavors which was nice of them. i think we did the habanero and buffalo. the wings were dry. we did appreciate the ample amount of fresh carrots and celery though.i can't remember what we had to drink from their hh menu that evening (and noooo, not because we drank a lot). i just can't find any pics of the drinks. i just tried calling them to inquire about their hh drink options and the host couldn't tell me a thing about it. their website also makes no mention of what drinks or food is available during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you know the absolute best part of the meal. i know i should say the company with my awesome girlfriends but hey, let's keep it real. it was the *free* garlic rolls man. they were so frekkin' amazing. this is a beautiful restaurant and nice location. too bad the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu wasn't better and i can't figure out what drinks we had that night. they recently opened a new location in san diego so hoping the food is a bit better.
i've been dying to come here but my friends and family had told me it wasn't spectacular. i can happily say i was pleasantly surprised. i was expecting outrageous prices but my boyfriend got a steak (ribeye i think) and he said it's one of the only charbroiled steaks he's ever really liked. my boyfriend loves steak and hates charbroiled so i think that says a lot. as for price his steak was $20 or so i think, so nothing crazy (like some other local &quot;famous steakhouses&quot;). i got <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food because i wasn't too hungry but there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was great! $5 for a huge plate of wings and $5 for two pulled pork sliders that were good. cole slaw wasn't special but the pulled pork bbq sauce was good! we also got giant craft beers for i think $3-$4. and the best part? it wasn't too loud or crowded like some places get. it was a nice, enjoyable <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> meal. well done!
this place has so much potential but always seems to be lacking. now that there is another major steak place in chino hills, maybe they'll get on their game. &nbsp;food is consistent, average. service consistent, good. prices are high considering what you get. if wood ranch doesn't hit the spot, try tahoe joes a couple miles away (especially the ribs, there is no comparison). they need to bring back their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. bar area is dead since they killed that (even though they had good food specials).
came here for a late lunch/ early dinner...and found out it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! how awesome is that?! anyways i had to have my required dose of their mac n cheese so i had the lunch combo with bbq tri tip sliders and mac n cheese. it comes with soup too but alas i ran out of tummy space. more importantly, i drank the raspberry ranch lemonade...holy sh*t!! it was amazing!! it had fresh raspberries muddled in there yum!! man i love this place!!
this would be our second time having dinner here. their prime rib has been consistently good. good bbq sauce! my husband and i ordered their pick three combo for roughly $25 bucks a plate along with their delicious clam chowder soup. the plate came with two sides, and we choose mac and cheese and fries. the beef brisket was tender, great ribs, and chicken was moist. they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 3 to 6 pm. ambiance was nice and warm. charles was the name of our server. if a server can predict what you want before asking, they deserve a 5 for excellent service on a busy night. host was nice and proactive. hats off to management for a well ran ship. by the time i realized i needed to take picture of the rest of the dishes, more than 50 percent of the dish was gone. :)
this is only my second time here, the first time being before my yelp days. i came in last week for a second <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with a colleague, still full from the first <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the wait at yardhouse was 20-25 minutes and being that we were at the tail end of a long day, we weren't in the mood to wait. the wait at wood ranch was 5-10 minutes with us being seated near the 5 minute mark. almost instantly, our drink order was taken. i had the lost coast tangerine wheat and it was perfect. i love blue moon and hangar 24 orange wheat, lc tangerine wheat is now officially in the rotation. the two of us are simple folk who just wanted a simple appetizer, chips and salsa. i'm a guacamole fiend and our server let us know that the chips and guac appetizer came with salsa... perfect!!! my companion ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and i snacked on the free bread, i couldn't convince myself that i was hungry enough for a second dinner. the guac was good, the chips salty and plentiful, the bread delicious. our service was great, very sweet considering that the restaurant was closing within the <span class="highlighted">hour</span>. overall, we had a great experience!
i love this place. like any establishment there are errors, every time i order to-go orders, something is always missing, usually my asparagus or mash potatoes, mainly side orders because i order a lot over whats provided with the meal. understandable, one phone call and they keep your information for the next time you come in to reimburse you that. the service is outstanding, the food is even better. a meal between me and my fiance is about $120 not including tip, but we usually tip very generously. best i mean the best filet mignon. the smell and flavor of the wood in your steak lingers, and even when i take it home for the next day, reheating makes a whole room smell like the wood chips they use. i def. recommend it here. i usually dress very casual or sometimes in work out clothes, there is no dress code, more of an older crowd, but best food you can get. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is actually better and more portioned than bj's an exit away. this is by far my favorite place for a good for sure filet mignon and buffalo wings. their mac and cheese is to die for, even better than mastros.
first time to a wood ranch ever and i must say, i should've expected this. when you want bbq, definitely look for a hole in the wall because you won't find great bbq here. don't get me wrong, it's edible and fills you up but lacking so much flavor.so the first thing that came out was the garlic rolls. the garlic was smothered on and looked a bit scary. i gave it a try anyways and wow, either the bread has been left out under the heat lamp for a long time or they got the bread couple days ago because it was extremely stale and chewy, the kind where you bit down and had to pull extremely hard. we thought this was the bad sign in the beginning, however it turned out to be one the most flavorful things there.entree that was ordered was half baby back ribs and tri-tip with sweet mashed potato and baked potato sides along with their signature bbq chicken chopped salad. i also asked for the salad dressing on the side but they still got a bit too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with their bbq sauce in the salad. their bbq sauce tasted like italian dressing and overall the salad was nothing out of the ordinary. they were a bit skimpy with their servings of white corn and beans in the salad. the ribs didn't fall off the bone although it was said by our waitress to have been slowly roasted for more than eight <span class="highlighted">hours</span> in their ovens. tri-tip could not be cooked to medium rare...because they just don't. baked potato was dry and sweet mashed potatoes were decent until about the fifth bite before it becomes a bit much.the dessert menu didn't have too much on it, about four or five items. however, i did see that they made their cheesecakes in house. i didn't try it though because the food wasn't impressive.overall, it is a typical chain restaurant. the service there was up to par but the food left me speechless. although before i left they handed me a coupon for my next visit, free dessert with a purchase of an entree....the latter is asking for a bit much from me, so i will have to pass.
buffalo-wild-wings-chino-hills
terrible service. i was going to give this place a chance even after the poor reviews, however, they are accurate. i tried calling about the &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; times and i had a extremely rude hostess pick up. she was not informed about the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and too lazy to pick up a menu or ask someone. she hung up on me! belive the reviews, i won't be giving this place any of my business and i will tell everyone i know of my poor experience.
it's a buffalo wild wings. it's neither great, it borders low average. there's &nbsp;cheap prices to be had if you are in the right time of day. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4-6, 10-close. cheap wings on tues and thurs.
wings and boneless wings here are great. love coming here tuesdays, thursdays, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. great place to watch games and hang out with friends. if you come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, get the nachos (the big one thats like $10) its huge!! and during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> its super cheap so its worth every bite. you can probably split it between 3 and get really full. the beer selection is pretty good too. i was just <span class="highlighted">happy</span> they had lagunitas ipa hahabut yea i only come here for wings nachos and beers so if thats what you want than this is the place.
i love this buffalo wild wings! the guys and gals that serve in the bar are so nice and do an amazing job, i've never had a bad experience! i personally love the bonelesswings in hot buffalo sauce! the salads (chicken cesar and buffalo) are also amazing! they have buffalo fries on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu sometimes that are very snacky along with great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink prices!
food is great as always. service slow as always, saw them all talking in the corner while my mouth was on fire and could of used a refill but overall great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> good prices! i'd recommend.
so i went here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and it was packed to the tee.the service was understandably slow, but at times it was very hard to get the attention of the waiter. we ordered the boneless wings that were on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special and got all kinds of flavors because of the deal. &nbsp;of the 5 flavors we got, including original, teriyaki, and parmesan garlic, i liked about none. and i love wings, so this was a huge disappointment. &nbsp;maybe i will try bone in one day.
love buffalo wild wings! great place to watch games, <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, and good food.my personal favorite flavors are: asian zing (spicy), desert heat (dry rub), and mango habanero (not for the light hearted!)pros: good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and good tuesday and thursday wing deals!late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: monday-thursday &amp; sundays 10pm- close (1/2 off most appetizers &amp; drink specials starting at $2.50 pint domestic, $3.50 tall domestic draft and $4.50 tall premium draft!)wing tuesdays: 55 cents for wingsboneless wings thursdays: 65 cents for boneless wings.cons: it can get really packed at this location, especially on game days. i've been lucky a lot of times of finding a spot at the bar. they have more bar seating than other bars that i've been to.
this is a good chicken place, i lova dis place. the wings are cheap in tues and thurs, it's like a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> there. =d get all of them, and if your a real man, get blazin....
never again. at least for me. too crowded, horrible service, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, extremely pricey, cold food. everything you hate about dining out! even for a &quot;bar&quot;. corporate places are all seemingly the same. overpricing america
buffalo wild wings is only worth it to me on tuesday, wednesday, and thursday when they have their deals. their wings are very tasty, but a bit pricey for me on any other day. they have an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too!
good place to drink and watch the games. food is whatevers. sometimes they dont put enough sauce on the wings, or they give really small pieces. service is usually on the slow side. they have good deals for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, cheap appetizers. i mainly come here to drink at the bar and catch a game. overall, chill place to drink with friends and get appetizers. if im craving wings ill go to wingstop instead.
wings &amp; drinks and game 4 of the nba finals. i'm a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> man! even happier when i can just waltz in and get a table in 10 minutes 15 minutes before tip-off. and even happier when i walk in and its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!! yay! just like any other bww you order wings, some drinks, and watch sports on one of their 100000 tvs. on tuesdays <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4-7pm?) most appetizers are 50% off, traditional (bone) wings are 55 cents each, and there are good deals on drinks too. for flavors, you have to order at least 6 wings per flavor.i tried the carribean jerk, parmesean garlic, spicy garlic, hot, and mild. all were pretty good. the hotter wings are actually pretty spicy (coming from a guy who loves spicy food). still the wings were cooked in a way that aren't anything to write home about.i should probably give it 4 stars because of its ability to deliver on a major sporting event + their awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal but i feel like it should be more of a general review of the place itself. the food is just a-okay, its the environment that really makes up for it.anyways, lebron james still sucks.
i used to not really dig this place for the food, but being with my significant other, he's got me liking wings a lil bit more. garlic parmesan is bomb, i dig asian thai chili status flavored wings. prices, i only think it's worth it durning <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. drinks included... i guess they're standard prices, but we all know those can get pricy without those <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. i love their french fries. i like getting their salted vinegar salt on the side. customer service varies. some of the hotter girls have stuck up attitudes, but the guys are usually cool, and the plain jane chicks are tight. during a game, shit gets packed and rowdy. some days, late at night, they have karaoke. unfortunately, i'm guilty of participating.
love the place, but hate their system. there was clearly enough seats to fill everyone that was waiting and yet, we still have to wait over 15 minutes. other than that inconvenience, i love the food. gotta have the basket of potato wedges during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and try the dry seasonings.
i've been here several times with friends and always during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. its never crowded, but the service seems as if it is.my reason for one star: 1. the wings are always inconsistent. they're either in a soup of sauce, or barely have any. 2. the servers are rude. one guy hardly checked on our table, and we had to go up to the register to get our bill. we asked him to put a certain amount on each card, and what ever balance was left over to put on any card he chose. this was too difficult for him and pretty much threw a fit, then split our checks. why couldn't he have done that in the first place? another time a woman was our server and she tossed the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu at my friend after she asked what was on special. rude. she also argued about what was on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and then reluctantly gave us our discount (they were domestic beers, but was claiming coors isn't). i love bww but the staff here sucks. if you can't handle customer service get a different job.
not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> un satisfied customer it was the 3 of us the fries were cold hard &amp; you pay extra just to get them my burger that was 12 dollars was nasty it was not as i remember from the time before &nbsp;the wings were big as a whole chicken leg the margarita was very weak we were charged &nbsp;7 dollars for one beer a price it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> the check was wrong and the sever was not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> when she had to fix it she brought it to the table it was worse than before im getting upset with this hole situation , the manager is dumb as hell too im never coming here again .......
buffalo wild wings is a place where you can be as loud and rowdy as you'd like. however, ever since they have increased their prices while decreasing the quantity of wings, i would prefer going to wingstop.here are the prices for the wings:traditional wings- snack 7.29, small 12.99, medium 18.49, large 21.49. boneless wings- snack 8.99, small 12.99, medium 18.49, large 21.49note: there is no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on the weekends.signature sauces: sweet bbq, teriyaki, honey mustard, mild, parmesan garlic, medium, honey bbq, spicy garlic, jammin jalapeno, asian zing, caribbean jerk, thai curry, hot bbq, hot, mango habanero, wild, blazin.dry seasonings: salt and vinegar, lemon pepper, chipotle bbq, buffalo, desert heat.in summary, i will probably only come here for large group gatherings. otherwise, go to wingstop for the quality and better prices.
what can i say that i just love this place! the wings are the best wings i ever ate, their flavors are amazing especially the mango habanero one! their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great with good selections on food and beer. i usually like going on tuesdays though because they have traditional wings for 70 cents each all day and if you like bone its the same but on thursdays. and last they have variety of beers on tap too! overall i love this place and enjoy coming here all the time when i get the chance
this is the buffalo wings place to go.... when you're in townlots of sauces, 50 cent wings during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, manga habenero should be illegal cause its so damn good and spicy.sports bar, packed when there are games, but what do your expect. i want to take my friends here. the sauces are delish. end of story. hooters can't compare, i do not cares about oyo this place is the best.
this place is on good on sundays, not just because of football, but because they have a late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that starts at 10pm ($3 beers, half off appetizers), karaoke and a club like atmosphere with some of ies hottest women. i highly recommend you go then.
this bww is average for bww, the sliders are great, and the staff is nice, but it just gets soooooo packed. &nbsp;the movie theater is right next door, so it's a bummer when you try to drop in for a quick beer and there is literally no where to sit or even stand at the bar (and that's on a week night). &nbsp;best bet is going during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> before it gets too busy, which is hard with a busy work schedule.
this place is one of our regular places. it's great on wednesday or thursday nights if you don't mind a little bit a wait. thursday nights are a little bit packed, depending on what game is on that night. service is a little slow, but that is completely understandable. i love their boneless wings and they give great service to my large group of friends. servers and waiters/waitresses are very friendly- even when it's late at night. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (after 10pm) is a amazing, even their drinks are pretty inexpensive and very tasty! overall, always a fun place to go!
i love this place especially the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! the only thing i dislike is the service at the chino hills location. we went and they started asking for our order before we looked at the menu. then when we were finally ready our waiter kept walking by and ignoring us. so we left. bad service! go to brea!!!
lets all admit we come here for the wings tuesday!!deals- all day till closingtuesdays- 55 traditional wings all day (traditional as in bones in)wednesdays- 65 cents any wing wednesdays (traditional and boneless)thursdayss- 65 cents boneless wingsbest flavors-parmesan garlic!!<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> varies but mostly withing 3-7pmtip- do not come when there is a game on...you will be waiting at least an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>...like all locations limited seating and slow service and slow food which adds on why people spend a good <span class="highlighted">hour</span>+ there..best time to come after 9 when the crowds die down!dislikes-order a &quot;basket&quot; of fries...it was seriously the amount you get from in and out maybe a bit more...-_-
while i'm typing this my fingers still smell of teriyaki sauce and my lips are slightly sticky. gross. i know. but i still want to say what a great time i had tonight! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! here we gooo! the music is bumpin' and the people are lickin' their fingers! it's a party in here!food: it's not of epic proportions or ambrosia for the gods, but tonight i was starvin' marvin' and i was ready to tear through the place. i hated the 20+ min wait (longest i've ever waited at a a bww) and i literally complained through the roof (starvation can do that to a person), but when we sat down, ordered, and the food arrived (fries and 6 boneless teriyaki wings) it was pretty awesome and worth every minute. the shell of the chicken was too hard for my liking, but under the circumstances i ate it anyways because the insides was still deliciousss! the fries are nothing special, really- but addictingly good. the teriyaki was overly salty (as i am gulping down massive amount of water right now), and it left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. got a little hard finishing the chicken in the end.service: was the turnaround for tonight! special thanks to nick, our waiter! he was funny, patient (as it seemed i was so hungry i was talking gibberish when ordering... lol), and just very outgoing. he cracked jokes, chatted with us when filling our water. just a really cool guy. i've had my share of waiters and waitresses at bww, most of them are nice and very attentive, but rarely conversational. he made our night pretty fun! :)we were full and we were satisfied! there's no question: bww- i'll be coming back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> soon, see you later!food: 3 starsservice: 4 stars
bartender chick needs to find another job. i understand we came in after a rush but you have to keep a poker face in this business. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu advertised a certain beer that they didn't even carry, so naturally, i asked her if she could sub for the same type and she got all bent outta shape. i ordered a different beer but then she insisted on asking a manager because she thought i had a problem. after i ordered anyways?! she was a snob for the rest of the night. the manager had the same idgaf attitude and said &quot;yeah we don't sub beers for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot;. at that point i straight told him that's false advertising if you don't actually carry the beer your offering. he just shrugged his shoulders and walked off.the level of professionalism is out the window here. my friends and i watched this sad, depressed bartender chick tell everyone about us as if we were the nightmare guests of the night. no smile, no enthusiasm, not one hint of kindness. i worked in the business almost 10 years trust me, i knew exactly what she was doing and it was completely absurd. we felt sorry for her. she got a pity tip even though she deserved zilch. the food here is crap everyone knows that. the sports and the service is all they have and yet even management is a joke.
well what can i say... i absolutely hate this buffalo wild wings! my husband and i live in pomona and rather drive further to the one in west covina to get better service than go to the one that is close to home and receive terrible service! the first time we went there it took forever to get our drinks and food, so i shrugged it off because it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and pretty packed. the second time there was only us and like two other people there and still took a ridiculous amount of time to get our food and drinks, and we asked for more ranch and it never came. so then the hubby and i decided we would only get take out from there, when i called they put me on hold for ten min and then hung up on me! i called two times after that and was hung up on every time! so we still continue to drive further to go to west covina for the way better service, i've given chino many chances and they have proved to suck every time !
this place took forever for everything!! an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> wait just to get a table, at least 30 minutes to get a beer. and another 15 minutes after that to get our food.. did i mention that we didn't even get all of our food at the same time? i'm currently waiting for an order of celery/carrots... i mean seriously? how long is this going to take? service is seriously lacking here. they didn't even take our menus away... no water refills yet. plus our mozzarella sticks were missing the mozzarella. what? &nbsp;i don't even know how they fried it without the mozzarella inside...otherwise the food is okay. nothing amazing but good finger foods to go with some beer. there are other locations that are much better than this one that offer the same food (it is a chain afterall...) the only thing good was the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal.
decided to give this place another try since i do love their wings, even though their service is crap. went on a sunday night at midnight..found out mondays and sundays after 10pm are 50cent wings :d so far, so good.they have a bunch of different <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> and deals throughout the week, so ask them about it. our waiter told us all of them nicely. we ordered asian zings *all time fave wings* and mango habanero. sweet and spicy!! sooo good!!!! these wings are my favorite wings of alllll time. no other places has flavors like the ones offered here. the only reason why i don't give more stars is because service still sucks. it was better this time, but still crap. we had to bring our bill up to our server cuz we were waiting forever again. i'd rather just order the wings to go...
when you're a broke college student, 50cent tues, 55cent wed, &amp; 65cent thurs are your best friends. 6 wings for $3 is definitely a catch! their different flavors are all bomb. personal favorites would be asian zing &amp; mango habanero. chino hills bww has the best service out of all the bwws although sometimes the patio service is kind of lacking. do keep in mind of what games are going on because your wait could be up to an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> or two. also check out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (from 4 - 6pm?) because all appetizers are half off too! so think about it... 50cent trad'l wings tues &nbsp;plus half off appetizers?! freaking delicious annd cheap.good place for parties. last night had 3 birthdays (2 of whom are part of a fraternity) and we took up the entire back station. great service from sarah! no complaints on how organized and efficient our servers and food delivery was. oh and if you're a lakers fan, chino hills will always be crackin! just sayin'!
all i gotta say is $0.50 wings! they're normally $4.99 for 6 (this is the min. order) but on tuesdays you get 'em (6) for $3!i've been to this location about a dozen times, mostly for their tue/thu specials. &nbsp;the traditional wings are much better than the boneless. on my last visit, the waitress told us some of the appetizers were half off. so my buddy and i split an order of nachos for less than $4. on our way out we found out that beers were on special too but we didn't get to ask for how much. i don't know if they have an official <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but we were pretty satisfied.service is usually quick, except when it's packed during sporting events. tip: ask for celery to douse your tongue a little when it gets too hot. the asian zing, mango habanero, and caribbean jerk are all good. the honey bbq and garlic parmesan are passable as well.
definitely the best wing place around this area and way better than hooters (though i may be biased since i'm a girl). i think the honey bbq is the best sauce but i've tried pretty much all of the different sauces and they are all really goodi love the nachos here too. i only had a problem one time with the chips being kind of stale but the waiter was really cool when we told him and he brought us out new ones and ended up giving it to us for free. service is great here. i usually sit in the bar area to watch the big screens. it's a great place to watch any and all sporting events but it can get pretty busy during game time so be sure to come either before the game starts or at half time. they also have a really good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i think its 3-7 monday thru friday and most of their appetizers are half off.
yesterday we experienced what rudeness &nbsp;really means when it comes to customer appreciation. &nbsp;the phone table ready system &nbsp;totally sucks. &nbsp;they call you when your table is ready but god forbid if you miss the call because &nbsp;it's too noisy or you're &nbsp;in the restroom, &nbsp;etc. last night was extremely &nbsp;busy due to the mexico soccer game, no problem it's a sports bar. it was extremely &nbsp;noisy, but we were sitting directly &nbsp;across the &nbsp;hostess for 20 minutes waiting, 3 feet from us. we went up to her and stated we had just missed our &nbsp;call. she said we just gave our table &nbsp;away. &nbsp;and there's a 2 to 3 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> wait for the next table really! did you &nbsp;not &nbsp;see us seated right in front of your face? she said yes but their system &nbsp;is to call you. really we requested to &nbsp;speak to the manager. i realize it was noisy but she &nbsp;started yelling at us &quot; that's our policy to call, we don't have to call anyone's name out, we don't have to wave at you just because &nbsp;you're &nbsp;sitting &nbsp;across from the hostess. it's a 2 to 3 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> wait, can't you see were full, where would you like to sit if there's no tables. &quot;how about the patio?&quot; she stated i don't have a server for the patio, so are you going to wait the 2 to 3 hrs or not? she was rude, impolite, and obviously &nbsp;was very fustrated. &nbsp; i realize &nbsp;it was busy, but on a night that you know it's going to be that busy, open the patio, be prepared. &nbsp;so we left went to chili's &nbsp;where we enjoyed our <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and game. my routine of buying gift cards for family and friends will not include buffalo wild wings &nbsp;gift cards ever again. get a management &nbsp;adjustment!
the short review: think hooters, minus the boobs and booty shorts.the long review: after our date at harkins theaters over the weekend, we were both feeling hungry (we didn't know that divergent would run almost 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, not including previews). &nbsp;seeing how i'd never been to a buffalo wild wings and kathy had only been there once for drinks, we decided to check it out.the place was pretty busy - baseball season had just started, the ncaa tournament was in full effect, and there were a number of parties going on. &nbsp;b-dubs (as they call it) has plenty of large flat-screen tvs showing various events, as well as numerous sports memorabilia from both los angeles and san diego teams; definitely a sports bar vibe happening here.kathy had never tried fried pickles before, so i ordered some as an appetizer to start with. &nbsp;we both liked them - plus the coating is a bit more crispier than hooters' version. &nbsp;as for our order, we split the half regular, half boneless combo - the boneless had the parmesan garlic (which was a bit on the creamy side) and the regular had the asian zing (a sweet chili, soy, and ginger sauce that was our favorite). &nbsp;the wings pretty much are cooked like hooters' wings are, but the asian zing definitely made them stand out. &nbsp;the fries were ok, but the coleslaw was definitely good - so good, i ordered an extra side of it!our server - who was tastefully dressed - was very helpful; she brought out samples of the sauces we were considering with a few tortilla chips and also made sure our iced teas were refilled.yes, buffalo wild wings can get pretty expensive, but those <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, wing tuesday, and boneless thursday specials look promising. &nbsp;plus, props to the place for recognizing lent with friday specials. &nbsp;think we'll be back, and i also want to check out the one near my place in san diego as well.
went here last night with the boyfriend and we generally go for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which is from 3-7pm monday-fridays. &nbsp;they have 1/2 off appetizers, which is amazing especially since we love getting the spinach artichoke dip with pita chips and the deep fried mushrooms. &nbsp;both served hot(!) so be careful before taking a bite right away.honestly this is just your regular american sports bar. &nbsp;i don't expect the food to be <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fbomb.com&amp;s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bomb.com</a> or the service to be all that great. &nbsp;it's just one of those laid back places where you can just chill and watch whatever game is on. &nbsp;i actually don't watch sports so it really doesn't matter to me, but perfect for a get together with friends if you don't want to hold a sports party at your place. &nbsp;i have been here on a game day and it's pretty intense. &nbsp;just make sure to get there early because a lot of people may not eat the entire time but they'll sit there just to watch a game which slims your chances of getting a table.for me this place can be too loud. &nbsp;the service was okay. &nbsp;i like my servers to be on their feet as far as drinks. &nbsp;i just remember asking the server to refill my boyfriend's drink but we kind of sat there waiting for quite some time. &nbsp;eventually, the boyfriend drank all of my water and yeah, we were pretty thirsty by the end of the night...like i said, just a regular sports bar... don't have your hopes too high.lina chen
all bad... i can't believe the waiter told that i don't have to be rude when i was being silly and joking. so we go for late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all fun whatev so i want to order another drink. we're sitting at the bar area. our waiter was everywhere but checking our table chit chatting with the coworkers and even on his phone showing the new manager his phone laughing and giggling. whatev im waving my hands trying to get his attention, finally got it. i simply said &quot;i was trying to get your attention&quot; in a nice joking way, the waiter dylan with an attitude said &quot; you don't have to be rude&quot; oh snap really? shit went from 0-1000 let me tell i was rude afterwards. so i spoke with the manager yeah useless. new manager, all need training on customer service. all bad. this was my go to place on tuesday night but sadly service at this bww is getting bad. even the couple next to us had the same problem where the waiter called her rude. no bueno sad. although the bartender guy don't know his name he's badass i like him. so i give 2 starts because i'm nice.... another thing they didn't announce last call for alcohol nor did waiter dylan notified us about last call
buffalo wild wings was definitely needed by the chino hills area, which was recently infused with a few other spots the region needed. &nbsp;it is a pretty good place to watch sports. &nbsp;each time i've gone, a sporting contest of some kind has been the main draw. &nbsp;though it happily parallels my occasional-to-frequent lust for wings. &nbsp;these are not the best wings. &nbsp;they do not approach the &quot;savage wings&quot; at russian river brewing in santa rosa, ca. &nbsp;but can i just cruise up to santa rosa of a tuesday evening, nibble and sweat happily away while drinking a pliny the younger? no! &nbsp;so i meander over the hill and settle in at the bar.the bar staff is great, and as far as i can tell so is the management. &nbsp;i've never sat at a table for wait service.they got rid of sierra nevada. that irked. &nbsp;though it was fun as, over a period of weeks, four or five different people apologized to me for that. &nbsp;and it made my trips that much cheaper, as none of their premium beers is worth the extra $ to me now. &nbsp;it is officially a no croaker zone to a hop junky (where sn pale ale is an analogical methadone). &nbsp;the wings:they are on the smallish side. &nbsp;but the sauces are quite good. &nbsp;better than wing nuts in ontario. &nbsp;their hottest, the blazin', is probably too much for any but the most eager fire eaters. &nbsp;it is the real deal. &nbsp;it builds a real nice, at times sharp, burn in the mouth and for me activates the tear ducts. &nbsp;the wild, 2nd hottest, is a fair amount cooler but still a good kick.many of the multiple other varieties are also worth a shot.the boneless wings are basically breaded chicken nuggets. &nbsp;i often opt for them instead. &nbsp;it seems like more bang for the buck, given the wee nature of the boneded ones.there are no great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink specials, but most appetizers are half off. &nbsp;the chili cheese fries got bigger and better recently, i think. &nbsp;i remember them being meager and depressing the first time i ordered.and on tuesdays, wings are 45 cents each, packs of 5. &nbsp;thursdays, boneless ones are 60 cents each. &nbsp;it is not a classy joint. &nbsp;lots of plastic and cardboard is involved with eating here. &nbsp;and there is lots of yellow and logos everywhere. &nbsp;but it is clean and <span class="highlighted">happy</span>.i'm feeling loquacious and like i could just keep finding little snippets of things to say so i'm going to stop now.update (12.9.2009): &nbsp;pyramid snow cap, a pretty good winter warmer (7%), is on tap.
this the second buffalo wild wings i have been to and i was not too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the service. the line was about and <span class="highlighted">hour</span> long, but then again it was 50 cent wing night. then once we get in and sit down it got slightly better. &nbsp; &nbsp;the waitress came by took our order but had a hard time hearing us. i know it was loud in there but we tried to speak up just short of yelling. anyway the order came in it was correct. yet for some weird reason i know it was cheap wing night but it seemed they gave us the smallest wings they had. each of us almost polished off 20+ plus wings to get full. on top of that we had like 4 different waiters. anyway given the size of the wings they are still delicious hence why i still gave it 3 stars. i have been to the one in rancho cucamonga its way better. oh fyi if you do the blazing challenge eat 12 of their hottest wings in 6 minutes be forewarned. you will get wings swimming in the sauce and wings the size of regular drumsticks it's a little clever ploy to have you not finish it.

great new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. m-f 3pm until 7pm. $3 local brew pints and half off appetizers #yum
i love this place! during the week it's a great place to grab a drink and karaoke. on the weekends it's a bar and tiny club which is also fun! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks are really reasonably priced. my friends &amp; i always get the best service. i really enjoy coming here!
&quot;there's no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because every <span class="highlighted">hour</span> is <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; is what the waitress told me. my friends i come here every now and then to celebrate because the drink prices arn't that bad and also because they show all the sports games. this place is fairly large and can accommodate a lot of people. they also have a larger patio with heat lamps and cool flames coming out the tables. all in all, not too shabby on the food. i particularly like their mac and cheese burgers and their lettuce wraps. another plus for all the men out there, the waitresses have &nbsp;this irish/catholic school girl outfit as their uniform. i would say some of their uniforms are borderline hooter's status.
food is pretty good and there is a lot of different beers to try. the service is very good. every one is very nice. price are good even when it's not a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;there are lots of tvs to watch the different games. &nbsp;i would recommend this place to everyone
three and half stars and that's because they've improved somewhat! first time here it was so loud (still really early maybe 6-7?) so definitely not a place for conversations. food wasn't that good. came back a few months later for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks which weren't priced too bad. came last night and it was a lot better. our waitress was vanessa who was really sweet and wasn't obscenely dressed or tremendously rude like i've experienced in the past. she checked back with us as well as the other tables around us a lot. it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so appetizers were 25% off, beer was $3 for 16 oz and $5 for $22, and its pretty good quality (i got hangar 24 betty ipa which was pretty good). i ordered the ultimate nachos which were $1 originally but we're 25% off. they were huge and decked out in bens cheese guac and sour cream. my only complaint is they were a little cold like they'd been sitting there. my boyfriend got the mac and cheese burger. he's really picky about mac and cheese (none of that kraft stuff for him) and he said it was pretty good. overall, it's a place i'd come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and that's about it
this place is really good for what it is. if you come here to have a nice sit down meal then you will be very disappointed.the drinks here are very good and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are great! $3 pints for me and i'm set. i came here with a group of people and some of them weren't drinking. we ordered almost all of the appetizers on the menu and those in our group complained about how the food didn't taste very good. this is a great example of how you should just take this place for what it is. the food is average bar food and, just like in most bars, the food doesn't taste that great but once you've been drinking it doesn't really matter as long as you can put something on your stomach. with that said, if that isn't what you want then don't come here. no, the food isn't that great, but it's a good place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.the service was really good, even though our waitress kind of stood in the distance staring at us for a while. apparently they turn into a club at 10 pm on fridays, but i didn't stay that long.overall this place has a good atmosphere and it's definitely somewhere you want to come with a group of people. otherwise you'll be drinking alone and eating food that's subpar, which is something you can do at home#19/100
drinks are super cheap. and it's a great concept. i come here just for all the tvs and cheap beer. do not ever expect great service here. owners are trying to do more with less to &nbsp;stay rich. everything takes forever every time. &nbsp;sounds weird that i'm saying all this but it's always a friends choice to come here not mine and nothing ever changes. if you can find <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> somewhere else i do, but if you get dragged here by majority vote then just be patient and you will have a good time. not to mention it always smells stale in here like the nightly duties are not being done in their entirety.
i stopped by here while on a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>/pub craw/we just want apps and drinks/whatever you want to call it.the place was packed on a sunday afternoon with people watching football. the food was good (good greasy bar food), and i was thrilled at the beer selection.plenty of beers other than the usual main stream ones, you can easily find one or two you probably haven't tried yet.
service super friendly, beautiful interior, great beer, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices excellent. ordered chicken marsala, not expecting amazing (this is an&quot;irish&quot; bar after all) and it was actually tasty. the bread that accompanied the dish was delicious... could have eaten a whole plate of that.
i love dillon's. all the beer on tap is $3/5 depending on the size and the food is inexpensive+tasty. some orders are also discounted during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the bartenders are friendly too. i highly recommend dillon's.*as of 10/1/14 the beers prices have been increased by a dollar for each size. now $4/16oz and $6/22oz.
this is the first pub i went to in chino hills. maybe, it's the only pub in the suburbs here? we got their fried avocados, mac and cheese sliders, and nachos. they were all really meh. there wasn't anything special about the fried avocados. the mac and cheese sliders seemed pretentious, something just didn't taste right in my opinion. i can't pinpoint it. so, their food was underpar. however, they got good prices for beer. my friends played pool here and that was fun to watch. otherwise, i'd prefer some other places nearby for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> instead.
i like it. usually head over to watch football (or now) hockey. &nbsp;its nice, has a nice feel, good it good and they have a lot of tvs. &nbsp;i go on sunday mornings or in the evening... a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;food is good, the people/servicers are nice. &nbsp;over all i plan to return throughout hockey and football seasons. &nbsp;nice neighborhood place for me. &nbsp;cheers!
beer selection is jusy so-so and service is getting worse. some good bartenders have left, too bad the ones who left were very good with the patrons. food is still underwhelming even with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. very bad management. compare the management here wit yardhouse aound the block and see the difference. place has also gotten raunchier and is not safe on friday and saturday nights. the crowd is no longer local.
came here for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the place was pretty empty. there were a few people at the bar but the majority of tables were empty. we were seated on the upper level kind of isolated. we had two different servers one changed in the middle of our shift. they were pretty friendly. the thing about this place is the price. they are a little pricey for the appetizer menu. there were some items that were more than an entree, which made no sense to me. the food was good. the mac and cheese burger was different but not bad. i really did enjoy the calamari. i would probably come here again. the one thing that did bother me was there was a fly that kept buzzing around it. i'm thinking it might be due to the farmers market but that was a little disturbing. we did get a free drink with our yelp check-in but was questioned about what it was and i had to give the manager my phone to verify it.
i tend to not review places based on one sole review, but because i was particularly curious about why this place received such bad reviews i wanted to express my own satisfaction on my first visit there earlier this evening.first, the decor was very nice (love the flame lit tables outside); second, the wait staff (including quite sexy kilt-clad waitresses) were both friendly and attentive; third, the food was very good, no complaints (in our party, we tried the lettuce wraps, fish &amp; chips, avocado fries, and the ahi salad); and lastly, the drinks were very refreshing (the celtic margaritas exhibited an interesting use of jameson).overall, it was a cool place with a fairly lively atmosphere (for a weekday evening). &nbsp;i am witholding a star only because there really isn't <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing on drinks and appetizers. &nbsp;however, i shall return to try the celtic (and see the kilts) a few more times.
i've been here quite a few times, great sports bar feel. definitely outdoes any sports bar franchises (yard house, buffalo wild wings, etc.), flat screens flood the walls, great music makes the vibe just that much better. i don't understand the super low reviews! probably guys hating that the hot waitresses don't pay any mind to them. the food is typical bar food, only better. definitely a great place for dinner with friends, watching the fights/games, and even a first date (breaks the ice with the unanimous rooting for the lake show, dodgers, etc.). i highly recommend this place, great food, great prices on drinks, and a great ambiance. obviously very extensively planned, every bit of the construction is impressive to even an interior design major like myself. me and my girlfriends always go there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after a long day at work.
came here for a friend's birthday recently, and had mixed feelings about this place after reading some reviews.i sat down at the bar with my boyfriend as we joined our friend's group, and never got asked what we would like to drink, or even got offered a menu. the guy that was walking around inside seemed to pay attention to the other patrons more than us, and there wasn't even that many people there. when another waitress finally came around, we ordered the nachos and french fries, and enjoyed our beers. i don't know if it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or not, but $3 for a blue moon? i was <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. the nachos were pretty good, they hella caked on the cheese, which i highly appreciated and made it ooey and gooey when it came out. the plethora of colored chips kept it festive, as promised. i do wish they put more jalepenos on it, but not a lot of people can eat them, so i understood why. the fries were great. i'm p icky about what type of fry i eat, so they were perfectly golden brown, and crispy. i love french fries when they're a tad mushy, so there were two varieties, so fist pump for that! the downside? the waitress said it would be seasoned? there wasn't even a lick of salt on our fries, so i wasn't too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about that.aside from that, the service was mediocre. our waitress never really checked up on us, and we never saw the waiter again. one of my girl friend's that was sitting next to me, paid $20 for her blue moon (which costed $3), and never got her change back, until we had to ask someone else 20 minutes into waiting. will i be back? probably not, but it was a good experience for our friend's birthday shindig. the beer prices on tap were excellent though, so if i do come back... it would be for that pure reason - otherwise i'm sticking with yardhouse across the street.
one year later and dillon's goes from 5 stars to 1. i went there last night with my friend for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. here is how it all went down....walked in... no one at the front, no host and no other guests. waited 5 minutes before someone finally came and said, can i help you? well duh! i would like to be seated!!i decided to sit in the bar area to watch the baseball game. over towards the bar, there were three guys, one you could tell was completely intoxicated. he tried to say something to me but his speech was so slurred, i couldn't understand what he was saying. the staff, in general, are really cool! the waitress and bartender were super nice! the manager, can't say much for him but i'll get to that...more obnoxious guys come to join the current group of drunk fools. my friend and i decide to move to the other side of the bar because they were being so loud and obnoxious. at one point, i wondered if we were on that show, &quot;restaurant stakeout&quot; because the way those guys were acting was way beyond belief. they were acting like idiots, dancing, videotaping each other, drinking and talking about how drunk they wanted to get. the worst part, none of the staff did anything to quite them down. all the other guest kept looking at them like, wtf! i made a few comments to the bartender but still... nothing. apparently, one guy (the really intoxicated one) had been in there since 11am drinking. i got there around 5:30...what does that tell you? he was so belligerent, that his friends finally made him sit down and drink water. sure enough, they had to escort him to the restroom because he tossed his cookies. on the way to the restroom, one of the other drunk idiots stops by and said to us, &quot;do you want to see his d..k?&quot; i was like wtf!!!! i've had it!!! i go to the front, ask for the manager. the host says, &quot;oh he's in the back.&quot; so i tell her, i need to speak to him now. i tell him what happened and he says, &quot;sorry. i'll ask them to leave.&quot; as he's walking off he says, &quot;peace out&quot;...peace out??? wtf! what kind of rude jerk did they hire as a &quot;manager&quot;!!!! so he heads to the restroom, says something to the drunk fools. did they leave, no! i was so disgusted by the whole event that we didn't even get to finish our meal and we left....should have not paid for the bill but we did. first of all, he's not a manager if he's sitting in the back doing absolutely nothing! he doesn't think about the other customers that are there trying to enjoy themselves. but then he probably didn't care because those guys were more than likely his friends. usually is the case... and what the heck was up with the jeans and t-shirt? everyone else is in uniform so i would have never guessed that he was a &quot;manager&quot;. &nbsp;i feel bad for the few people that work there because they are nice...but never again will i step foot in this place!!!
after months of <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> at yard house and ra. after months of talking obvious coming to dillon's, we actually did. i don't know what we were waiting for, but now we can't wait to come back!i arrived later than the rest of my group and everyone was getting up and moving when i got there. i thought they were all getting up and leaving because i was so late, but i digress. they were being moved because the hostess had accidentally sat us in a reserved section. the manager came per and apologized profusely as she moved us to our new table and bought us a round and two desserts to thank us for moving. honestly, it wasn't that big of a deal because we're all pretty easy going, but its the thought that counts and she definitely took care of us. the hostess came over and apologized as well. we definitely appreciate the attention to service we got.now, on to the food. i don't know what was consumed before i got there, but i know what the yelp community told me to order (and i did).-fried avocado: so good we ordered two! it comes out resembling fried zucchini and tastes so much better! imagine creamy, delicious avocado enveloped in a crispy blanket. the crunchy and the smooth were perfect together. on the side is a lemon mayo and chili aioli and both were good. while they're great on their own, i liked the combo of them mixed together (as per our servers suggestion). i will absolutely be ordering these again and again!-smoked artichoke: the artichoke was delicious! it was smokey and tasty. i liken it to the smoked artichoke at lucille's, minus the balsamic. it was good, i'll be ordering it again.-mac n cheese burger sliders: wow! these little guys were just amazing! the sliders themselves came out on a deliciously chewy bun, similar to a king's hawaiian roll. the burger patty was juicy and tender. the mac n cheese on top was cheesy and delicious, and held together nicely was we ate the burger. everything was perfect here, i didn't need to add anything. the fries that came with it were great too.-chicken quesadilla: the quesadilla was good, but came at an unfortunate point in our appetizer frenzy. tis was one of the lat things we ordered and we were probably a little too excited. don't get me wrong, it was good but we had eaten our fill. the portion size was generous and daunting. i'm embarrassed to say we only ate two pieces of the quesadilla as an entire table because no one was hungry anymore. it was good, i'd consider ordering it again but i think it's clear what my favorites were!the dessert the manager gave us was the bread pudding. she spoke so highly of it that we had to get it, and boy was she rightl the bread pudding was toasty warm when it came out. it was ooey-gooey and delicious. the custard was sweet and delicious. the ice cream on top was a nice pairing, the warm and cold worked well together. the whiskey sauce on top was the figurative icing on the cake. overall, this desert was delicious and not to be missed.i think it's safe to say that we'll be back!
my first visit here happen to be on dodgers opening day 2015 so i knew it was gonna be crowded however i dont exaggerate &nbsp;the fact how me and my party had to wait over an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to be serviced at all. we even in this <span class="highlighted">hour</span> had to switch locations and find new seats in order to maybe be served. when i finally was able to wave down a waitress who rolled her eyes in disbelief that she had to serve more people. we gave her both our food and drink order and well that was almost a whole <span class="highlighted">hour</span> until my girlfriends soda and my beer came which both ended up being either warm or completely watered down from it sitting with no one bringing it to us.so literally once our drinks came an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> later our food came which was the reason for the 2 stars because it was delicious i ordered the guinness stew and my gf ordered the bbq burger with onion rings. what made me most annoyed of all was the fact how i was able to see our waitress pay attention to parties that shes bringing 4 plus beers to their table multiple times before even looking in our direction.i personally very rarely ever say anything to a waitress about their service to their face but i needed to say something in this event. i explained to her how she seemed to be very slow and she said sorry but it was busy and their understaffed, but i flat out told her that i clearly saw her giving service to other tables by bringing multiple rounds of beer before my 1 beer even showed up to the table and she after had no comment no apology and i even told her that i was not gonna pay for the soda that she tried charging me 3 dollars for which was completely watered down and no refill was provided to us. so i was fine paying for a few of the items but i did not want to give this place another chance for that horrible service and purposeful ignoring. it sounds terrible but i gave her a quarter for a tip for our almost 30 dollar bill just so she understood that you need to provide a decent service to receive a tip from a customer. 2nd visit:i have a long review because i wanted to mention my revisit which was a normal friday night which honestly i give a 4 star to this visit. i unfortunately forgot the name of our waitress ( she has a light blue strip in her hair) she was great and extremely attentive to us along with others she was serving. overall this experience made my extremely <span class="highlighted">happy</span> and more hopeful for this place knowing theres plenty of good service here its just some individuals slip through the cracks and have terrible service. i will be back soon though.
papachinos-grill-and-greens-chino
omg. this fish stew !!! amazing !! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu .. friendly staff .. the fact that this place is so close to work makes it much more convenient.
ceviche salad. fresh foods, nice for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or lunch.
i love this place. super clean. friendly staff. amazing food. quality service. there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, can't be beat. and there pumpkin roll is to die for.
went for lunch on a saturday and the service was great. they were friendly, efficient, and helpful. i recommend the chicken tacos and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals. i would definitely go back!
we came on a saturday for lunch. it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so $2 off appetizers! &nbsp;there is a cute outdoor area with tiki hut covering. it doesn't quite match the food they serve. this must of been some other food place before. we ordered the ceviche and ahi tuna. the choices see to be healthier options. it took about 15 min to get the food. totally worth it! &nbsp;food was delicious and healthy!the story with this place is that there was this man who had heart problems and could not find a restaurant that had food that he can eat. so he made one! &nbsp;thanks.
four stars for the combination of good food, &nbsp;with reasonable portions, &nbsp;at cheap prices. i always get the fish and chips, &nbsp;and it is made perfectly! the batter is light and crispy. i am a fan of quick service restaurants, you can get in and out at your own pace. you can get your own refills, and sauces, instead of waiting on someone. you don't need to tip as much either. they have amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, with $1.50 domestic draft beer and &nbsp;$3.00 imports. the only reason why they lose a star is because they have the worst mac n' cheese i've ever eaten. but everything else is amazing!
this restaurant is great! &nbsp;i love the fish and chips. &nbsp;the workers are all so nice and their patio is wonderful. &nbsp;they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 2 to 6 with $1.25 beers. you can't beat the prices and the atmosphere. &nbsp;nothing over $10 on the menu.
this place is a hidden gem in chino! &nbsp;just moved into area and was looking for an outside patio to have a beer with wife and be able to bring our dog. &nbsp;outside patio/ checkcool breeze under palapa cover/ checklots of beer choices and pitchers / check checkfree chips with lots of salsas to try ... yepwhat we have found after coming back a few times is they have great healthy food -- kind of a mix of typical mexican with lots of different fish choices. &nbsp;the shrimp tacos and ceviche are really fresh and tasty with really fair prices .... <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $10 beer pitchers + other deals and the vibe of the entire place has been really relaxing with sports tvs outside. &nbsp; stop by -- you won't be disappointed. highly recommend this place --
great food. great service. you can't really beat 2 tacos and a pint of domestic beer for $5 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. your choice of protein and only add $1.50 more to upgrade to an imported beer. i've gone here a few times with my boyfriend and it's hard not to get the deal, though they have a ton of delicious choices and daily specials. the atmosphere is filled with music, either from a live band or a dj, which makes eating there even more of an experience. oh! how could i forget... bottomless chips and a salsa! mmmm!
didnt honor ad pricesthis rating is strictly regarding the customer service i received on one visit. i often frequent this restaurant the food is great and healthy. specifically patronized during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because of the prices posted on the web. &nbsp;i found i was being chared a higher price than what the web advertised. the bartender told me the web was wrong they changed the prices. after showing her the ad on their site from the phone i asked for a credit on the difference. she said no. i ordered drinks for a couple of hous and asked three times, &quot;for the sake of great customer service&quot; will you honor the price. she said no. then she went to the back office, changed the pricr on the web and charged me full price. i asked the waitress if the owner was in and she told me i had been talking to the owner.....the bartender was the owner.astounding that the customer experience wasnt more important to her than the, at most, 8 dollar ad differnce. so very disappointed.
grilled steak...lemon-butter salmon...teriyaki chicken skewers...shrimp wraps...jumbo scallop pasta....papachino's offers plenty of tasty options as you can see. and guess what.. they're made fresh and healthy!! it's a great way to eat right for good prices. you probably think i'm joking right.. a health concerned yelper?! well yeah! haha. i gotta balance out all the bad food i've been eating over the years. so it's always a nice change to find a place close to home that can provide good quality eatery =)everything is equally delicious and you get a variety of side choices like brown rice, pasta salads, fruits, and veggies. c'mon, do yourself a favor and try it already!note: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> daily 3-7p. enjoy a few beers and tacos in the spacious patio outside!
i had never heard of this place before until today when i had some business in the area. my friend suggested we check this place out because the menu looked very interesting and they offer a lighter side and healthy food for those that are health conscience and counting calories. i ordered the seared ahi with the grilled vegetables and brown rice. the fish and the grilled vegetables were tasty, the brown rice could've been a bit better. the prices are very reasonable so i couldn't really complain.they have a very well-stocked salsa bar with complementary chips, which is a great feature. the staff here seems very friendly and helpful as well, there was an overall very positive vibe and also laid-back atmosphere. if your local you probably already know about their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that goes from 3 to 6 pmi would definitely return to have a light healthy meal here when in the area.
went here after sunday church. it was about 12 in the afternoon and it seemed pretty slow and it was a bit annoying trying to order because there menu is on the wall in line where you go to give your order. it would be different if it was a small menu but they had a lot of options for food so it made it annoying trying to order for a group of 10 people.i ended up ordering their shrimp tacos which came in soft taco shells. it seemed that with the lack of a big crowd it shouldn't take a long time for our food to come out. we waited about 25 minutes then finally one of the food items came but overall we had to wait over 30 minutes to get all our food.my shrimp tacos were the only reason why i give it even 2 stars because the shrimp had a good taste to it, but the problem is they place so much sauce on the taco that after eating 1 the rest are soggy and the texture makes it not enjoyable. it made me annoyed and when the waiter who gave us our food came by to ask how it was my group told him honestly that it didn't taste good at all. instead of saying sorry or anything similar he just said, &quot;ohh&quot; which actually made me and my group laugh it seemed like they always get people saying the food is always good when it's not.i hear people tell me how great it is but i feel part of the reason is because they do have some of the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials during the weekday which i can see getting a lot of people to come. besides that i don't think its very special of a place. if i have a friend who wants to try it ill give it another chance but as of right now it wouldn't be a top choice of food locations in chino. &nbsp;again the small high lights of why i even gave this place 2 stars is because the shrimp is cooked well and because they have a full bar which is a nice addition anywhere.however,i would recommend wahoo's up the same street toward chino hills much better quality.
red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chino
we used to go to here at least three times a month but since they tried to get fancy with the plates and silver fry holder we have gone once in three months. &nbsp;the prices went up because of the plates and new fancy menu. &nbsp;get rid of all that and lower the prices again. their burgers are great. &nbsp;i love the servers. &nbsp;they got rid of all my favorite managers and now train employees. &nbsp;we still love the burgers and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;service is good and the beer is cold and cheap during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
came here for late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.had the burning love burger $9.49. burger was pretty good with the friend jalapenos. also substituted the bottomless fries for bottomless garlic fries. love how the garlic fries can be bottomless too.got disappointed because they used to put bits of garlic chunks in the garlic fries, but they don't do that anymore. they just put garlic sauce on it= fail.did not like how the waitress was slow and when we asked her about how much drinks costs on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, she didn't really know.
food was great. service was great...and they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> b]i have been going to this joint just recently. and i missed out on alot of good stuff. idk if its just me or what, but they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. and they have really good deals! their whiskey burgers are really tasty and i enjoy their bottomless fries! id come to this place over and over again just for their fries. i love their freckled lemonade! but i wish they had actual frozen straberries than the ones that have been thawed already. good thing they were bottomless!! this place has a good location just on the spectrum. and the place looks like all the other red robins. &nbsp;i agree with other reviewers, that tv should be bigger, since their place looks a bit more in the sporty side. overall...excellent restaurant :]
went here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and dinner with my family (as well as another location). all the trips have been really good and i have no complaints. i've always watned to try the little crispy onions (becasue they look so darn good)but i haven't ordered a burger....yet. they have good portions and good prices. all the food i have recived has looked and tasted good, though sometimes i'm just not a fan of the flavor. so when i say tasted good i mean it tastes just like they tell you it will and there are no burnt portions, or stale food involved. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are really good too if you can stop in on a weekday.
great burgers. great drinks. love there unlimited fries they give you when you order a burger. service is always usually good. been coming here for awhile now. only down side is they don't really have an appealing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
i love their burgers here! i think they have the best of all the similar type places ( chillies, fridays, etc). also never ending fries!! and their fries are great too. but the negatives... i didn't realize it before but this is a popular place for families and kids. lots of kids. last time i came around dinner time there were kids everywhere running around, and screaming, and crying, and servers running to clean up messes. i don't have kids so i guess i will be less bothered by it when my time comes. but for now i would only come for a late dinner, like 8pm or later. also, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals are kinda weak, as was the margarita i ordered. but i will be back! for the burgers and fries. yum : )
chilis-chino-hills
5 stars for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!i'm not normally a fan of their food. however, they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!i'm not a big fan of alcohol, but their original blended margaritas is pretty darn good! best part is, they gladly provide unlimited free chips and salsa!we love it because we only spend about $5 each after tax &amp; tip. so, it's a great place hang out and chit chat!
this is not my usual chili's but came here because we were really hungry. we sat in the bar area since we believe it's fast service and also because it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> of the have good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. our server was great he was fast, attentive and very friendly. we ordered two appetizers and our entr&eacute;es and my husband order his two usual draft beers. our food came out pretty fast and served with good amount of portions. we enjoyed our meal, the ambience was kind of noisy but its a bar, it's to be expected. it was an enjoyable experience for dinner.
i love chili's <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. &nbsp;my family will definitely back for many more nfl monday night football. &nbsp;my kids were in love w the tablet. mom and dad actually not so busy to attend the kids needs. &nbsp;drinks were great. &nbsp;foods are ok. &nbsp;too salty w the fajitas though.
came here today for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. pretty good service. they were not busy at all. we started off with some nachos which were really good. the sparkling &nbsp;pomegranate margarita was super good! i ordered the new philly cheese steak sandwich. it was awesome!! overall it was a great visit today!
you know, your typical chili's. we came here late on sunday night, and i got to judge their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>:$1 off margaritas, draft beers, 1-liquor drinks. $.50 buffalo drummettes (i would recommend these!)$3 skillet queso (probably only good if shared - too much cheesy meaty gooeyness for myself alone)overall, decent. the bartender made a weird shot that looked like weird stuff you'd probably see in an anatomy lab. they seem like chill fun people.
my family and i have &nbsp;been going to this chilis for 2-3 years now. &nbsp;we typically go in on sundays for their amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals all day. their staff is very friendly and always takes time to chat with all 4 of us. &nbsp;food is great, service too. &nbsp;new remodel makes perfect ambiance for sports lovers. new mexican menu is my new favorite. &nbsp;margarita bowl and chipotle bowls rock!we never sit in dining area because we enjoy the bar atmosphere and multiple televisions. &nbsp;alex, annie and all the other sunday staff are amazing! &nbsp;we will continue to come in here as long as the service and food remain the same :)
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was very disappointed, drink specials were pretty weak. domestic beers were about $4.50, margaritas were about $5, and well drinks were $3.75. &nbsp;we got the 2 for $20, appetizers were very limited, everything fried, ended up getting the chips, corn guacamole and salsa, the most of the chips were crumbled and rendered useless for scooping guacamole. if you are going to go for the $2 for 20 get the chicken crispers, they are delicious and come with corn on the cob and fries. my gf got the chicken fajitas and they were laughable, the chicken looked like it was microwaveable, so sadly to say &nbsp;we shared my food, serves her right for ordering mexican food at chili's.
one of my favourite places to eat around home, ever -- i come here like all the time. and what's even better now is the fact that i'm 21 now! yay! margaritas and beers are half off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!so, it's usually busy around the evening <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, of course. but all of my services here have been great: friendly servers and they're very personable.food: baby back ribs -- they're delicious!! you can't go wrong with them! get a rack! mix a rack! they're great!! once in a while, a steak is great as well -- i like mine rare, and chili's definitely cooks it a lot better than some other places. dessert is always awesome as well, like ice cream desserts or something with chocolate mousse.what i also like is that the to-go service doesn't take too long, and the cashiers are pretty great with that too. it's also a pretty clean place for a franchise restaurant, and it's always fun to go in large groups.
i've been to several chili's before, i know what to expect. we arrive at 3pm and the door is opened by a lovely host ready to greet and sit us down. she was great. she tells us if a booth is okay and who our server will be. couldn't have gotten a better host than her. server was o'kay, nothing great. the place was dead and we couldn't even find her to refill our waters for about 7 minutes. she should be walking like a headless chicken around the area seeing if drinks need to be refilled or if someone is trying to tract her down. i order unlimited soup and salad. misses orders chicken enchiladas. orders are taken and she disappears for about 20 minutes. like a headless chicken i was expecting her to come back because my combo comes with chips and salsa but she never did and i wanted to munch on something before the meal comes out. i've never had their soups before but they were good. after the first bowl though they started to be a bit heavy for me. just too much. they're hearty though! misses entree looked not so great. the white sauce they put on top of the enchiladas looked clumpy and microwaved. i really can't tell if it was or not but the consistency of the sauce seemed really off. i would give this place a two star but do feel a bit bad. the host was awesome and well, who am i to be leaving two stars anyways. maybe i just went at a bad timing. if im in the area again maybe i'll go back for just drinks and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. if i want dinner i'll go to the shops across the street and go to a restaurant more to my liking.
shoboo-kitchen-chino-hills
not impressed. sister took me during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and said their sushi was amazing. but i don't even remember whether the sushi was good or not because our server was what took all of my attention. she acted like we were doing her a disservice by being there and &quot;forgot&quot; to bring edamame until my sister kindly reminded her. maybe the sushi was good, i don't know, but the service was bad enough for me not to come back again.
no ayce. no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. no bigs!my husband and i love shoboo! when neither of us have the appetite to do ayce, this is our go-to sushi spot. they have awesome lunch specials, even on weekends! for $8.95, i can get my favorite crunchy roll (they make them just the way i like it!), spicy tuna roll or 3 pieces of sushi, (love the salmon!) miso soup and salad. for $2 more, instead of the crunchy roll, my husband upgrades to their specialty rolls, like the red blossom or rainbow roll, his favs. the fish is always fresh and the sushi has a good rice-to-fish ratio. we always leave super full, super <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, and super satisfied. the service has always been fast, efficient and friendly every time we've dined here or if i ordered to go. i still have yet to try their new &quot;create your own&quot; poke bowls and ramen. i had to deduct one star due to the following:- uncleanliness of the hallway leading up to the restroom. the sight of the dirty dishes make the place look dirty. - broken a/c during the hot summer days is unacceptable. the last couple of times we had lunch there, the a/c was not running.
they have a pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and saki bombs are ridiculously cheap. we usually buy a few and share with the sushi chefs. fun times! if you like sashimi salad, then you must try the spicy sashimi salad! this is a large salad with a lot of fresh sashimi and a ton of fresh lettuce. the dressing is to die for. i typically split this salad with my boyfriend and we are pretty full after we finish it. the salad itself is a little pricey but the portions are well worth the $10 or so.. i would also recommend trying the peppered tuna, jalapeno poppers, and a few of their specials rolls.
i'm going to agree with matt r. on this one. after being here twice i was surprised that this place had 4 stars with so many reviews. i can't see how it deserves more than 2 stars. first off my friends and i asked what the sign saying &quot;all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; was referring to. the waiter seemed like it was the first time he was asked this and said the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu consisted of 1 thing: buck 50 sake bombs. i asked if there was anything else, and the answer was no. the second strike was when we tried to order the yakidori, and the waiter told us they don't do that. by this point we were feeling misled, and were considering leaving. third strike was the miso soup. usually this comes after you order and before your food arrives. for some reason they brought it out halfway through our dinner. so they struck out, and the game is over. we aren't going back.
it was a lazy sunday and i was in need of a sushi fix. missing the clock for a few other sushi bookmarks, i found this place hidden inside chino hills with a &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day&quot; sign posted up for all to see... well the &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day&quot; is just a gimmick to pull you in, cause their prices are like any other average sushi establishment, and is actually bordering on expensive if you ask me. they did have some nice lunch special deals that we're available, but i was feeling balla' regardless... and went with their normal menu. i ordered the sashimi salad ($10.95)... the salad was okay - it was considerable in size and had a good amount of sashimi; it was dressed well and could have easily been share. however, my largest gripe was that the sashimi was cut into large cubes and hard to really enjoy. it was undoubtedly quite fresh for chino hills sushi, but the freshness wasn't well highlighted with how the fish was cut.would i be back? maybe for a big group? they seem to have a pretty extensive menu with lots of fusion rolls, which make for an easy crowd-pleaser.
my experience with shoboo kitchen was excellent. i came here with my friend for an early dinner. there was plenty of parking and the wait was non-existent. the restaurant was lightly decorated for the christmas holidays. there were plenty of seats, but all the tables were small. i think they'll have trouble compensating for a large party (8-10). the staff was very friendly. the chef was kind enough to give us <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on their drinks, for our first visit. they even made a small flower and butterfly, out of a radish, and presented it to my lady friend (yes it made me look bad...) but it was nice of them anyways. the food was delicious. they have a vast selection on their sushi rolls. the red blossom roll was my favorite though.
pretty standard sushi restaurant, but not one of my faves. i have a high standard when it comes to my sushi lol. i love sushi! if i could eat it everyday i would lol. this place is really small with a smaller sushi bar. they have your pretty standard rolls, nothing out of the ordinary. the staff, however, is a crazy bunch. they pride themselves on making sure you are having a good experience and go out of their way to make sure they greet you on your way in and out. one downer was that they don't have an all you can eat menu but they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices everyday because it's their 2 year anniversary. it's a good place to try out at least once.
this is our first 5 star rating.. so u know this place has to be good! we are extreme sushi connoisseurs so we know what we're talking about! some of the freshest and most high quality fish you'll find anywhere! the staff is extremely friendly especially the lady that you'll usually find in the front of house. the sushi chefs often come to the dining area to see how their guest are enjoying everything, a gesture always appreciated! this restaurant oozes with the staffs passion for food and everything from quality to presentation epitomizes the phrase &quot;attention to detail&quot;. long story short, if you want high quality food, a high quality dining experience at low expense(<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices all day) then this is the place to be! maria and ivan out! ^_^
their pricing is excellent for certain items. for example, if dining in, spicy tuna rolls only cost $3.50. add to that the fact that they are almost always running a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special, and it's just good times.while the fish isn't the best quality, the service is incredibly friendly, fast, and courteous. the owner works often, and he's always smiling and having a good time. i haven't tried too much of the cooked food, so i cannot really comment on that area.the sashimi/nigiri here is really hit or miss. i've had the blue fin here before, and i wasn't too impressed. usually, i'll stick with the salmon, yellowtail, and albacore. again, this isn't anything to write home about, but it's definitely not terrible quality either. the main reasons to come here would be that it's cheap, the alcohol is almost always on sale, and the staff is very friendly and courteous. if you're looking for amazing sushi quality, then this probably is not the place for you. also, i'm talking more about sashimi/nigiri than the rolls/cooked food.
&quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day&quot; was all it took to convince me to try this place out last sunday. its charming little sushi joint located inside sprout shopping strip mall on grand ave. next to see's candy and chick-fil-a. though the space looks rather small and crowded, we were able to score seats quickly after a few tables became available.i was surprised how afford-ably cheap their sushi and rolls were priced, including 30% off on all beer and cold sake. our server was very friendly, helpful and informed me that there sushi are competitively priced which is why they're able to market them as &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.&quot; we ordered the yellow tail sushi, poke salad and 24 piece sashimi combo which includes 2 spicy tuna hand rolls and spicy miso. the sashimi and yellow tail sushi were surprisingly good. nice plate presentation and portions were generous. surely not the best sushi i've tasted, but fresh and great value, especially the sashimi combo priced at $30. the spicy tuna hand rolls were packed with plenty of minced tuna, well seasoned and scrumptious. poke salad was another exceptional dish that we loved. the portions were huge as well and can probably feed 2-3 people. more on the spicier side as opposed to subtle, but was very flavorful, fresh and delicious. unfortunately, i found the spicy miso a bit too hot and spicy. i could hardly drink the spicy broth without coughing and choking. the only thing edible from the soup was the large piece of shrimp that accompanied it. unless you can tolerate the heat, i recommend getting the regular miso. along with large bottle of asahi and few sodas, we ordered a few more items but had them to go instead which includes - chicken cutlet entree, beef and chicken teriyaki combo. all were excellent and arrived warm. what was surprisingly nice was the bill which only came out to be around $80. great service, good food, cheap priced sushi and beer. how can you go wrong with that? i can't wait to come back soon.parking - plenty huge lot.
i'm fairly new in this town, explored so many different sushi places, and i must say &quot;shoboo kitchen deserves to hold its #1 rated japanese restaurant&quot; in the area.the service and food quality are the most important factors, and they pleased me in both. the owner never lost her smile and made us very welcome and comfortable. the food was pretty fresh and very yummy. &nbsp;if you are looking for light and sublime taste, i recommend sunshine roll. if you don't mind something little heavy, try italian roll. it was very flavorful and filling with lobster and scallop. &nbsp;their chef specials were unique and delish!as they advertise their price being at &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; all day, price is really decent. &nbsp;pretty cheap! &nbsp;:) &nbsp;portions? a couple of rolls filled me and my husband up, and my husband can eat! we even came home with leftover. &nbsp;the owner gave us direction on how to eat it the best at home. &nbsp;lol i think this place just became my favorite!! &nbsp;can't wait to try other menu. overall, just great!
clayton-brewhouse-and-eatery-san-dimas-3
clayton brewing is a-ok. the food was good, nothing too incredible. my party ordered the panini and soup combo, salmon tacos, the bbq pork sandwich, and the southwest egg rolls and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. the southwest egg rolls were good, reminded me of chili's, but were a little on the salty side. the bbq pork sandwich was also pretty good, i wish the pork was a little less dry and there was more bbq sauce.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was great too. in addition to the weekday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, they also have saturday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - i love saturday <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> (12-4)! they have a pretty good selection of craft beers for only $4 a pint! such a great deal! the service was very attentive. i was honestly a bit surprised that there weren't more people in the restaurant. we came at lunch time on a saturday and were the only ones in there. hopefully business picks up for them because it's a cool space, friendly service, and pretty good food. i'd go back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
wasn't that impressed with this place. went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, expected better prices. wings were still $1 a piece...good location and friendly atmosphere though.
first time here, lunch before x-m&aacute;s shopping. deschutes porter, very good! food was great, ate from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. will be back for the sunday brunch to see how they do their monte cristo. &nbsp;san dimas has needed a gastro pub like this!
parmesan truffle fries were amazing! my blue cheese bacon burger oozed of cheesy goodness! should have come along time ago cuz this place is great. friendly staff and great service! looks like the have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals &amp; discounts during sunday football. i will definitely be back!!!
pretty decent food and great brews!! service was chill as well as the atmosphere. hidden little gem for a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> when in the area! the garlic parmesan fries are amazing!! def worth checking out!! imma roll thru again for sure soon!!
clayton is mediocre at best. the food is nothing worth remembering, their beer is just ok, and their service is nothing to complain about. i've been to clayton several times and each time i hope that it will be better than my last experience, but sadly it never is. i've had their seared ahi tuna salad (12.95) which was warm and a bit fishy. the buffalo wings ($9.25) were pretty standard. the white truffle garlic fries ($7.95) were pretty good and unique. the texas pork tacos ($9.25) were overpriced and poorly prepared. you get was 4 small corn tortillas, maybe a spoonful of their bbq pork and a dash of coleslaw. the most disappointing part was the tortillas were not even warmed before serving. it seemed like they were straight out of the tortilla bag and onto the plate. for a dollar more, you can order the bbq pulled pork sandwich ($10.95) which comes with a generous portion of the pulled pork and your choice of fries or side salad. also these pork tacos are $4 for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or $1.50 per taco on tuesdays. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &amp; taco tuesday pricing is much more realistic for what you are served. clayton does have a decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (fri 3-6pm &amp; sat 12-4pm). if you are looking to meet up with a friend for a beer and to watch a game, then this might be a good stop for you. they have several options to choose from ranging from $4 - $7 and $1 on all beer &amp; wine.i most likely will not be coming here again. and if i do, it will be for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and a beer or two.
came here on a thursday (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day) and had a pleasant time. relatively little people there so the service was quick and personal. tried a sampler of four different clayton beers and they were delicious! cold and tasty! also had the pork fries, which are so good with a cold beer. definitely recommend this location!
came here on a saturday afternoon luckily at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and had a fantastic time.clatyon's is great.it's spacious, relaxed, and comfortable.i didn't feel like i was coming to a bar.beer selection is extensive--written on a mirror in the back.the food was surprisingly delicious.the menu.3 clayton blonde: $12. &nbsp;this was perfect, light refreshing, not the slightest bit bitter.1 yeti stout: $6. &nbsp;i didn't like this. &nbsp;it was heavy, sweet, not what i was looking for.mediterranean bruschetta: &nbsp;$6. &nbsp;absolutely delicious. &nbsp;it was perfect to go with the beer comprised of artichoke hearts, olives, tomatoes, and herbs. &nbsp;served with perfectly toasted crostini. &nbsp;a quite generous portion: perfect for 2. tinga de pollo quesadilla: $7. &nbsp;this was fantastic, a lot better than i thought it was going to be. &nbsp;the menu describes several complex flavors and i was astounded that i could taste the chipotle, smoked jalapeno, tender chicken. &nbsp;yum. &nbsp;even better, it was grilled.all this with tip came to $37.71i'll be coming back soon on a thursday when pints are on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing all day. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is normally m-f 3-6 &amp; saturday 12-4.this is a great place to come with a friend, a group, or even alone and relax have something good to drink and enjoy yourself.i only wish i had started coming here sooner.
great food...good prices...excellent beer! what else can you ask for? the staff here is friendly and helpful. the have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (even though we missed it by 30 minutes) i will most definitely be returning. relaxing atmosphere and would like to come back for a game day.
we came cuz of yelp and thank you! had the best experience. the beer selection is great a does the job. the pork fries are so amazing and are huge enough to share. paul is fantastic to come out and talk to us. personable and welcoming makes a perfect come back bar. <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> are perfect. a true hidden gem.
i think the best way to describe this place would be as a spacious restaurant, cafe, and bar all in one. meaning there's actually a section that's a bit more like a cafe, and a section that's a bit more like a restaurant. they have some really great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on beer, outlets for your laptop, and a small selection of craft brews. love that their coors and bud section is titled &quot;if you must.&quot;
came by the other day to try it out for the first time after work. the place it self looks great...nice and clean with plenty of room. the staff was super friendly and easy to talk too...so the only buzz kill was the lack of options to drink. i was thinking they would have more craft beers other than the same common beers. overall ...yes i would come back for a quick drink for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or lunch but if you're into drinking more rare drinks your gonna have to go somewhere &nbsp;else....
i believe this place is a little newer but after eating there this past wednesday and i was a little shocked how empty this place was. we went there just at the tail end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which has some decent drink and appetizer specials (good beer selection). we tried two kinds of wings and the pork fries to start. the wings are big and meaty with a solid buffalo sauce, orange sauce is worth a try too. one in our party prefers his wings a little more crispy he said. the pork fries i think are a must try, at least once, how often do you have fries with sriracha? we each had burgers for the main course, i went all american and the other tried the bleu bacon. it is a big hunk of a burger that is cooked pretty well done. it tasted good, nothing crazy and we both agreed that the buns were a little to much bread, i believe they were home made though.all in all we would definitely return for another <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, could be a great place to check out before montana's on a friday or saturday evening. another note was the our server was amazing, granted the place was dead. if you are in the area, give this place a try.
i'm kind of torn between giving it a 3 or 4 star rating - definitely in the middle of those two. however, i'll bump it up because they usually have some solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals here and are usually pretty good about recommending a beer for you. the staff is really friendly although it can be a little hard to flag them down sometimes. in my opinion, the food is okay. it's nothing special in my opinion since it's just solid barfare. the greasy truffle fries and burgers makes a good pairing for your beers. overall, it's a great place to meet with a large group of people! they will also split your checks if you tell them ahead of time even if your group is much larger than 6 people. parking in the evenings can be a pain, but if you circle around enough, you'll be able to find parking within 10 minutes. in the day time, the lot is pretty dead.
great place! i love the food. they have a unique menu and the prices are good. i love the lobster sandwich and the truffle fries. the restaurant is always clean, the restrooms are clean. the food is always fast and fresh. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> has really good prices too. i really like the flat bread pizzas too! i recommend clayton's
came here for dinner and arrived before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended. we were able to order 2 beers and 3 appetizers for $24. we ordered the salmon tacos (4 came on a plate with a plenty of salmon and a semi-spicy sauce), the 4-inch margarita pizza (complete with pesto), and the mediterranean bruschetta (marinated olives, artichokes, and peppers). all was tasty and would definitely bring me back to try their other entrees, burgers, sandwiches, and salads. the waitstaff was definitely gracious of our service.
went here last week with a friend for the first time, a little hard to find if you don't know where you are going; but it's in the shopping center in the corner. thankfully it wasn't busy when we went and it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;took a seat at the bar with the nice bartender girl! (she's super sweet!) and we went with the truffle fries, the flatbread which comes with a clayton beer, and the sliders. from everything i loved the flatbread he most. it was cheesy fattening and delicious and for the price you can't beat it &nbsp;as for the beers i loved the clayton ipa and the blonde if your going for something light and refreshing then try the blonde. idk but the aftertaste was bomb hahaha. i would much rather come to this spot to grab a drink than go to yard house or something, it's more chill and it's cheaper and they have everything you would want to drink.
i came here to meet with some girlfriends for dinner :) its so empty! but don't let that fool you... the food is quite delicious!!we came on taco tuesday so the tacos were priced at $1.70 per taco. they offer a chicken, a salmon, and a pork taco. forget about the pork and just get the chicken and the salmon! the flavor on the chicken was amazing! very pleasantly surprised as i am usually a pork person~ the downside is that the tacos are small so i needed 5 of them to really fill me up! (as you may already know if you read my posts i'm not one to eat a whole lot either!)the garlic fries were also quite tasty and crisp! it was also <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so wines were $4 :) i got the riesling (my fav!) but it was a bit strong~last but not least, our server was so sweet! loved her! 5/5 overall.
this is place is pretty awesome! it's much more spacious than a typical cafe since it doubles as a restaurant and a bar! atmosphere- very chill, spacious laid back, cafe-esque. there are tvs and music playing but was quiet enough where i went to study for my business law final.service- excellent! our waitress was on top of everything and answered any questions and made recommendations. food- it was pretty yummy! my bf got the burger which he said was very good. &amp; i got the soup, salad, half sandwich combo which too was delish! but next time i'm there i'm sure to try a burger and craft beers. oh &amp; as for drinks, try the spanish latte it was amazing!price- typical cafe prices close to $10 a meal. i just missed <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but i will sure try to come back at that time. all in all, clayton's is definitely worth trying.
i don't know how this place isn't packed?! i have been here numerous times at different times&amp; days, and it is a ghost town! the food is great, i can't seem to branch off from the pulled pork sandwich with side salad (the vinaigrette is yummy!) it is just that good, &amp; &nbsp;we always have to get truffle fries for the table to share. my husband always enjoys the different burgers he orders. the only downside to this restaurant is how slow it takes for your food to come out. it's empty, and still takes quite a while... &amp;&amp; the beer is pretty good too! bottom line, if you are in san dimas, and hungry, go try clayton's out, it is yummy!updated 10/6/14; still slow, but the food is still outstanding! &nbsp;i had their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> chicken tingas tacos the other day, and they were so yummy!!!! &amp; they are a rodeo sponsor- so that makes them even better for supporting the community, in my opinion!!
came here not knowing what to expect, didn't check it out on here until after food prepared perfectly, beer sampler was amazing, servers were on top of their game for sure, they have a bar, and tvs showing the games, and the chef seriously asked how the meal was all in all i will come back here for sure <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is mon-fri 4:00 pm-7:00pm and sat 12:00pm-4:00pm $4.00 pints and wine by the glass extremely <span class="highlighted">happy</span> wiyh this place.
this place is great. very chill vibe. spacious coffee house that also serves beer and has free wi-fi. what else do you need in life? oh, i suppose some pretty decent and reasonably priced food to munch on as well. the owner and the staff are all pleasant and social people that make you feel welcome and taken care of without hovering. i've had a couple different sandwiches, a couple different salads, and a couple different soups as well as the chorizo breakfast burrito which was simply awesome. all the food is good quality and not too pricey for what you are getting. great beer selection and the quality of coffee they brew is something to be noted. all around, i very much enjoy this place and come here to do a lot of writing. if you want a quiet place to peruse the internet or do homework and sip a beer, come here. support local business. oh, it looks like they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> mon-fri. probably leave the books at home during that time.
pretty average. i would say 2.5 but the servers and beer round up. &nbsp;the servers were very friendly, welcoming and attentive. but i think that's because it was pretty empty, two servers to manage about three other parties at the bar. i like the aspect of having all the beers on the wall in dry erase, hopefully meaning that they rotate their beers with new ones. the ambiance felt a little off though. the dining area was very open. i felt like the lights needed to be dimmed more and something else to make the place feel a bit more homey. it was just a bit incomplete. &nbsp;i came here for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and its a pretty diverse hh menu. i ordered the grilled salmon tacos ($4), garlic truffle parmesan fries ($6) and balsamic ahi tartare ($7) with one white rascal beer. the two salmon tacos were under seasoned and a bit bland. the fries were covered in this alfredo like sauce with grated parm cheese. i imagined a truffle oil instead of a heavy sauce that was very salty. the ahi tartare was disappointing too. it was essentially a thin layer of tuna and avocado on a large portion of pickled cole slaw, a ratio of about 1:3. i didn't know i was ordering a small salad. the servers were great but the food fell short. i'm sure this place is great though for its many beers. that's all i would come back for.
the restaurant is located in a shopping center on arrow highway. &nbsp;upon walking in, i noticed how bare the place looked or at least, that was the impression i got. &nbsp;our server was nice and helpful in helping us decide what to order. &nbsp;we ordered the beer flight, fries, buffalo wings, mac and cheese and skirt steak. &nbsp;the beer flight is on par with most other establishments that i've been to as far as pricing goes. &nbsp;the liked the fries because of the crispness and cheese sauce doesn't hurt either. &nbsp;they do give you a boat load of fries though. &nbsp;definitely should be shared, unless you are super hungry. &nbsp;i liked the mac and cheese because it was creamy with a truffle taste to it. &nbsp;i didn't get to try the buffalo wings, so i can't comment on that. &nbsp;the skirt steak was a big disappointment. &nbsp;the steak was pale in color and didn't taste like it was grilled on an open fire. &nbsp;it looked and tasted like it was grilled on the flattop and then a branding iron was used to add the grill marks on it. &nbsp;a normal skirt steak should not look like it was boiled in water. &nbsp;it should have real grill marks and charring. &nbsp;the chimichurri sauce wasn't bad and made the steak edible. &nbsp;i also requested the meat to be medium, but it came out well done. &nbsp;normally when you cook a skirt steak on the done side, it gets chewy. &nbsp;but the steak wasn't chewy so that leads me to think that it was definitely boiled. &nbsp;i don't know if i would come back if i was in the area. &nbsp;but if i wanted to take advantage of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and/or beers, then maybe. &nbsp;the only thing that sucks is that there aren't that many sit down restaurants in this area. &nbsp;so the choices are far and few in between.
this used to be a coffee place which is why it doesn't exactly feel like a bar or brewery. it feels like a little coffee place. but they have a few tvs, beer, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day. exterior: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=y_rk4vdmbvybuik6n31ouw#y_rk4vdmbvybuik6n31ouw">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>first time here was great. the roasted red pepper soup was awesome. the salmon tacos from the starter menu were good. red pepper soup: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=sx9xy5mxloow1idum-9eeq#sx9xy5mxloow1idum-9eeq">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>salmon tacos: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=nblsmm-kvwnlwmm7oudxxq#nblsmm-kvwnlwmm7oudxxq">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>second time wasn't as smooth. i asked for the californian burger and accidently got the cali chicken burger. just a misunderstanding but it took us a while to get it straight that i never wanted the chicken burger. after it was cleared up, she explained that they can't do a rare burger. or a medium rare burger because of health laws, blah blah. she said they would try but they are supposed to do medium. my heart sunk, but since i usually get medium when i ask for medium rare anyway i could do it. but it was more medium well. couldn't finish it. it was like a hockey puck. too bad. it seemed a shame to overcook and waste what looked like a nice thick burger. &nbsp;california burger: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=8qfgs2nzvexiwesv7vcbsg#8qfgs2nzvexiwesv7vcbsg">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>californian burger &nbsp;interior: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=6cq_pthfi5xghn_cu6jyzg#6cq_pthfi5xghn_cu6jyzg">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>but my side salad was good with all romaine and no crappy iceberg. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdffhn1uawrpuqnnittyw?select=hrtg2kanoguzhrzyltnbza#hrtg2kanoguzhrzyltnbza">yelp.com/biz_photos/rpdf…</a>i like to sit and enjoy their free wi-fi and a beer now and then, so i will still go back, just stay away from the burger unless you like them cooked into hockey pucks like my mother does. &nbsp;every couple of sunday's they have a blues band play with a couple of special bbq plates available.
the food is good here and although service is a bit slow, especially during lunch (although we've never seen it busy even during that time), we had no real complaints. &nbsp;then we came here with our kids. &nbsp;although they have a kids menu so they obviously do cater to children, they didn't have a cheese quesadilla on the kids menu so i asked if it was possible to make one for my kids. i asked for just a plain cheese quesadilla, and she clarified that i didn't need any toppings. &nbsp;it arrived as ordered but when i got the bill, they had charged us for a full price chicken quesadilla ($9) and when i asked about it, our waitress refused to budge and mentioned it wasn't her problem that we decided to omit all the chicken, toppings, avocado, etc that normally comes on their quesadilla. &nbsp;she also charged both my kids for full price adult drinks ($2.95 each), even though they put their drinks in small kids cups and there is not a chance they drink like adults (with refills, etc). &nbsp;so, $12 later for less food than a kids meal (priced there at $6.95 including the drink and side), we felt quite taken as they made out well on our bill! &nbsp;additionally, it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i although i'd already confirmed this to be the case, when our bill came i had to have half the items on the bill redone because she tried to charge us full price. &nbsp;we felt quite unsettled as we left and we will definitely be going elsewhere in the future.

the food and drinks here are good. they now have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is every day 3 to 6 pm and 9 pm to close
been to this location 3 times. the food is okay and constant. i wouldn't go back if we happen to be in the area. they should better their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu by offering more drinks and food. &nbsp;food was ok. grilled chicken was rubbery and dry. they offer margaritas and long island, limited draft beer. they need to have more variety. we ordered the 2 for 25 special. the place is a bit it dated and should revamp.
great spinach dip and buffalo &nbsp;wings. &nbsp;and gets even better during half off <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 3-6. servers seat us quickly and take our orders. &nbsp; like any restaurants; you need to know what to order.
staff here is amazing! never a bad experience. everyone is always so friendly and hard working. i never see anyone standing around talking. the environment is very quiet but pleasant. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great! i also love that the restaurant is open late. nothing around the area is open late. i hope this place stays here forever!
i like this applebees alot better than the one near the west covina mall, but the food is almost always the same quality... i just like the service here. they also have a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i really like that 2 for 20 special they used to have. idk if they still have it, but it was such a good deal.
great spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! my bff and i got full on a $12 dollar check! the bone in wings , onion rings and fried green beans are pretty good. their 2 for 20 deal is a great bargain delicious and filling too. hit or miss with the servers though. one server in particular is really cool unfortunately we forgot his name. super nice and very accommodating to us. &nbsp;another visit we had a server that barely came to check up on us. we had to keep asking someone else for refills. then another server came up to us and told us she was taking over since the other server left for the evening. wow. don't servers usually let the customers now that they're gone for the day and introduce the new server? hoping for the cool server at our next visit lol!
i've been here twice now and i can now put an average on my review. i would prefer to give it 3.5 stars but it will have to do.the first time i went, i was with a group of friends and we took a table in the bar section. it took us probably 10 minutes to flag down someone to order drinks and waited even longer to order food--mind you, the joint was not busy that evening. the food was good that night, i remember ordering the wonton tacos and they taste exactly like chinese chicken salad (one of my favorites!) and we ordered other appetizers such as a quesadilla which was only average.my second time i went, i sat at the actual bar with a friend and were able to order two beers at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and were served very quickly. don't be attracted to the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices though, it was only a $1 decrease in the beer from what i could see. the food was average once again. i ordered sliders and i barely tasted them--nothing special. my friend had the fish and chips, he seemed to enjoy those. i personally don't like that item so i didn't ask to try it.i would say that the service in the bar area is going to be different every time you go so don't get your hopes up. the food isn't anything special, it's just a quick place you can get a beer, in my own opinion.
it's a nice place to eat and hang out with people. we asked to sit by the bar and it didn't take long until someone came over to take our order. our waitress heather was very nice and attentive. while the bf and i were enjoying the appetizers and drinks, she would come and check up on us every now and then. we had the appetizer sampler and everything was pretty standard and good. they're similar to what you can get from tgi/chili's, etc. can't go wrong w/ ordering the sampler!in the end i would definitely come back more often during <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. i do recommend getting the green bean crispers! so good w/ the sauces that they give you.
i've always liked eating at applebee's, so when they finally opened one in my neighborhood i couldn't be happier. they always seem to have something i'm craving for, which gives their menu selections a huge kudos for me. they now also have health conscious menu selections, which i appreciate since i'm trying to be a bit more watchful on what i eat lately. the appetizers are awesome! service is very attentive and friendly. sometimes i swing by here to just sit at the bar during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and watch the game or have dinner here with my dad.and no matter how many times i've been here, i always end up staring at all the crap they got on the wall...it helps pass the time when you're waiting for your order.
bait and switch.its an applebees so i dont go in expecting much. &nbsp;decided to go because it was late and barely anything else open. &nbsp;i go in on a sunday and ask if they have late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the hostess says its not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but there are late night specials. &nbsp;she leads us to our table and gets the menu insert with the late night specials, points to it and says &quot;there, it's half price appetizers.&quot; &nbsp;at this point i'm feeling good because i know i can get what i want for not that much money. &nbsp;i order 3 things, mozzarella sticks, cheeseburger sliders and chicken wonton tacos. &nbsp;the waiters takes our order and we get our food. &nbsp;the food is fine, the service was fine. &nbsp;the problem came when we got our bill. &nbsp;the bill came out to $28. &nbsp;i was a little confused because i thought appetizers were half off. &nbsp;i ask the waitress and she says thats only monday - friday. &nbsp;i then explained to her that we were led to believe from the hostess that it also included today. &nbsp;the waitress apologizes and offers to go talk to her manager to see what they could do. &nbsp;she comes back and says since its football season they do have a special but it only applices to mozzarella sticks. &nbsp;i am still confused as to how they led me to believe it was half price for all apps. i was tired and didnt want to raise a big stink so i say thats fine. &nbsp;they took the half off for mozzarella sticks and $4 off as a discount. &nbsp;i still paid more than what i thought i was going to be paying. &nbsp;if one of your employees misinforms a customer you need to make the mistake right. &nbsp;this night applebees failed miserably. &nbsp;even though its so close to home i wont be coming back here. &nbsp;i'll take my chances with mcdonald's nuggets. &nbsp;at least i can be sure of how much i am going to pay.
chilis-grill-and-bar-diamond-bar
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sucks!! you need to sit in the bar area only to enjoy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and its sooo loud in there, plus their selections are sooo small and still expensive i think (for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that is)... menu could be better i find it a bit boring.. food is ok ...
birthday freebie and great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!free ice-cream brownie for your birthday with the purchase of an entree! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 3-7pm, $2.99/$4.99 food items and $4.50 margaritas! service was absolutely amazing! our bartender was second to none and really took care of us. food was pretty standard bar food, but that ice-cream brownie was absolutely to die for! warm and soft in the center, topped with a big scoop of ice-cream and warm fudge, each bite had a hint of caramel - heaven!super easy parking!
great place for sunday lunch. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day in thr lounge. remodeled with many tv's and great bartenders. come in and catch a game and a beer!
great place to grab a drink during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. food is decent with a lot of variety on the menu. it has a bar kind of atmosphere whether you sit at the actual bar or not. its nice to go to with friends
so the first thing we're told when we sit down is that they're out of the southwestern eggrolls...really??? it's barely 3pm and you're out of food!?! what kind of $h!t is that??? it's not like the place is jammed pack...it's relatively mild!!! if not for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the service, this would be less than three stars.
stopped in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with colleagues. not a huge fan of chilis anyways but was only place to go for a margarita near the office in diamond bar.1 star for service, which was decent but the drinks were not made well, i think i was drinking fruit juice, and i am not even exaggerating, &nbsp;lol. i ordered the mango patron margarita and the el nino- both were good tasting but you barely any alcohol. my friends had margaritas and they said the same thing. we also had tableside quacamole and chips-1 star for that because chips were hot, fresh and crispy and the guac, well, you cannot really go wrong with that.ambience for a thursday at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was okay, not a whole lot of people. all in all, would not go back by choice.
really not worth coming to unless you really crave mediocre food.i've tried their burgers and appetizers, and you'll get bettertasting food at in n out. no joke. very slow service, and a lack of it. i can't comment on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or the bar, but that seems tohave better reviews. come to watch the game or have a drink with your friends, not for a sit down meal with the family orwith a date. there are so many better restaurants right down the street in the village.
came here with my gf for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ordered the beef nachos and boneless wings and food was both mediocre. also got a large blue moon and everything was whatevers. nothing too special except they got these cool ziosk where u can order and pay through this little tablet looking things. do not order the queso skillet, it does not taste good and the complimentary chips and salsa were alot better.
i love coming to chili's because of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday. working late and craving something some what healthy chili's isn't a bad place to go. it is good place to bring a friend and take advantage of the 2 entrees for 20$ with appetizer. i enjoy the consistency of the food their pretzel chicken bacon sandwich is my go to order. also must try the table side gucamole the server brings out all the ingredients and mixes it in front of you. my only complaint at this chili's is the service. i'm not sure if it's just not enough servers or what the deal is coming around <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i typically sit at the bar and the tables are always not cleaned. waiting for the food always takes 20 min one time almost 30+. half the time the server is non existent luckily they have this new electronic that you can just slide your card to pay and just leave. i definitely have better serve experience at the puente hills location.
i'd give 3.5 if i could, but they get the lower end of the stick.chili's. &nbsp;food isn't that great. &nbsp;too salty for me. &nbsp;i've tried their steak and fajitas and wasn't impressed.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is decent. &nbsp;they start at 9pm (+1 star) and this is one of the two places in diamond bar that you can drink at &quot;late night&quot; (another +1) meaning past 9 pm that i know of at least...the other being oaktree lanes. &nbsp;there's <span class="highlighted">happy's</span>, but they don't serve hard, unless you count that &quot;ku&quot; soju. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> you get free thin and airy chips and salsa, which was blended and mild. &nbsp;hard is a buck off, and i think beer too. &nbsp; 50 cent buffalo wings, which were decent, and a queso dip for 3 or 4 bucks, i forget. &nbsp;i shared some kind of triple platter, and none of the items i got were very good (southwestern egg rolls, crispers (which were supposed to be chicken, but i swear it tasted like fish), and chili boneless wings, which tasted more like honey). &nbsp;service was great. &nbsp;constantly checked on us and very attentive.
i'd like to thank paul aoun &amp; the city of diamond bar for bringing chilis to diamond bar!!! it's a great fun place, great <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. lots of beers &amp; great margaritas. awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour's</span> 4-7, 9-close. tv's everywhere, music, well trained attentive staff &amp; good host of locals &amp; visitors. chilis original baby back ribs are to die for! they also make the best buffalo wings &amp; fajitas. tacos, turkey burgers, salads. prefer the original burgers over the new craft crap. super disappointed over that!! i like the &quot;simpler&quot; chili's of the past. this new, over-sized in variety &amp; overwhelming options..... not any of it is outstanding &amp; more over a chilis &quot;classic&quot;. &nbsp;drinks, meets, hangin out, it's a great choice! * fits in with our ranch country history
diamond bar does not have a lot of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> places, so chili's fills that abyss. located in the same area as target, it is hard to miss because it is literally at the southwest corner of grand ave. and golden springs dr.it gets packed friday evenings, but i have been here so many times that waiting is not even an issue for me. i love that the staff here are very friendly and accommodating, as well as quick and understanding.my usual orders are baby back ribs or a fish dish (the tilapia is pretty amazing, guys, especially the mango salsa!). i've had probably all their margaritas and my beer of choice is blue moon. i have also had long island cocktails, which are good too. i rarely am at the bar area because i usually dine with friends or family, so having a table gives us the opportunity to do our own thing.
chases-la-verne-la-verne
went to chase's for the first time last night with 4 of my friends. &nbsp;we all loved it. &nbsp;we ordered 5 appetizer's off their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and then 2 entrees, which we all shared. &nbsp;the food was very good. &nbsp;the boneless ribs in particular, with mashed potatoes and fresh grilled corn on the cob, was delicious! &nbsp;the mac &amp; cheese needed a little salt, but it was creamy and kind of light, which was a pleasant surprise.our waitress was excellent . . . willing to share her knowledge of the food and beverages and make accommodations as requested. &nbsp;she even prepared a &quot;special&quot; drink for us. &nbsp;one of my friends told the waitress she wanted to start slow, so she asked if they had lemonade (they did). &nbsp;then she asked if they had strawberry lemonade. &nbsp;the waitress told her they didn't but she could make it for her. &nbsp;then the waitress asked if she wanted a little vodka in it. &nbsp;my friend was up for that, and when it came it was sooo good. &nbsp;not too sweet or strong; just tasty and refreshing. &nbsp;we are definitely going back!oh, and one more thing we all loved . . . &nbsp;the prices on the menu include tax. &nbsp;i have never seen that done before and think it's wonderful - what you see is what you get!
if you go just for wine, its a pretty good place! &nbsp;i was very disappointed though the other night when we came here for dinner... the service was terrible! &nbsp;first the waitress had very little knowledge about the wine selections, and then my father had ordered a manhattan, she looked at him with a blank stare and asked how to make it! &nbsp;really!!! &nbsp;i understand it is a wine bar, but it also serves as a full service bar! &nbsp;my dad finally gave up and just ordered a beer. &nbsp;we ordered our food, i ordered the steak purses and artichoke dip off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, the purses were pretty good, but my dip was taken to another table (by our waitress) so i didnt get that til the very end of the night. &nbsp;my dad ordered the chases mac n cheese which was the most terrible mac n cheese i have ever had! &nbsp;he is a nice guy, so he wouldnt tell them it was terrible, but i couldnt get myself to try more then 2 bites! &nbsp;it was the most bland tasting thing i have tried in a while! &nbsp;dont try it!all in all, we had a terrible waitress and the food kept getting messed up or was late! &nbsp;like i said, if you are just going for the bar, make sure they know what they are doing... probably safe just to stick to wine and wine only!
pappas-artisanal-la-verne-3
this place has a great atmosphere. the service was excellent (thank you lisa!) and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is excellent. we ordered an appetizer and entrees and all the food was amazing. super fresh, really delicious, legitimate food!!!!!
i came here just at the end of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special with a couple of girlfriends. we got the kettle chips which were great and a steal during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at only $1. the service was great and i ordered the spinach and watercress salad and the truffled fries. both were awesome, but the fries were especially a standout! this would have been a 5 star review, except that as it got busier (it was a saturday night) the service suffered. if you are able, i recommend visiting during off times. i plan on trying more of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, and of course, those truffle fries again!
super great environment. we went for a friend's birthday lunch and the food was excellent, as was the delicious carmel iced coffee. the reason i tok of a star was they forgot to put some stuff on the sandwich that was supposed to come with it. but its a great gem. im sure <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> would be fun too.
delicious food, especially the baked potato fries! i was also obsessed with the coffee caramel ice cream float - i'm not usually a coffee person, but there's something about the combo of cold brew coffee, caramel and ice cream that speaks to me. the cobbler is also delicious, i only wish i were less full so that i could have enjoyed it properly. (: the prices are decent and i would love to come back again for the brunch or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> some day!
yum,yum,yum!! everything i have ever eaten there has been fantastic!!! i mean everything!! they have great daily specials on the menu, a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger. the staff is nice too. i wish the food cooked a little faster, but it is sooo worth the wait!! you won't be disappointed in your experience. the only thing i would change about this place is, more comfortable chair's. great atmosphere for everyone.
ate here for the first time today. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger special was great. food tasted delicious and the place had a cool vibe and friendly people. this will definitely be my new spot to eat before class.
nicely set up interior and from what i understand, the menu could be seasonal and they won't always serve the same dishes every time. &nbsp;i ordered the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger, had a side of truffle fries(?) and an agua fresca. &nbsp;the burger was on point and portioned just right for me, the potatoes however, i didn't really care for. &nbsp;they were fried potato discs with a truffle b&eacute;chamel sauce...but not enough b&eacute;chamel sauce...so really just fried potatoes. &nbsp;agua fresca was very refreshing and a great alternative to soda or overly sugared lemonades. &nbsp;i have yet to come back for the brunch.
i have always been a fan of pappas since they first open. they have a great selection of food and drinks but i really love their agua fresca. they also have an excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that i go every thursday after work and their prices are reasonable.what i really love about pappas is the dinner menu changes, i get to try different creations from chef travis. i highly recommend coming for lunch, dinner or sunday brunch.
we came here last monday not knowing they had dine la verne going on with a $30 3 course meal.didn't sound too enticing, all i was hoping for was that the limited menu still included the veggie burger.yup, score, all good, i am a sucker for a made in house veggie burger, always interesting to see how they make it and what its made of.this one was excellent, a mix of veggies and grains, not too mushy as most get, prepared and presented perfectly, great flavors.the side salad also good, a nice light and healthy feeling dinner for $11.it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so my husband ordered the burger off that menu, same as regular burger menu, just 4 oz instead of 5.he enjoyed it. my son got the kids meal with a burger and chips and liked it.my husband also got the chips off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and we shared one of each taco at were $1.50 each.i loved the fish and veggie one, though both on their own were lacking, i added the fish to the veggies, now that was good, amazing really.the steak and al pastor were good, but the fish and veggie better.the steak quesadilla is a better value than tacos if you are hungry, my husband really enjoyed that.also the free churros with check in, awesome!!!!even better when they are free, hot and crunchy, very tasty, perfect way to round off the meal!service was nice, very on top of things, food came out fast and made very well.i'll come back for the full menu or brunch next time, though the veggie burger is very much worth getting again.
we were in la verne area and decided to have brunch around the area. this place has a really neat inside structure and awesome ambiance. upon looking at the chalk board, they have sunday special menu.we ordered steak and eggs and the crumb cake. the steak n eggs came with 2 sunny side up eggs, hangar steak and the home fried potatos. they were delished. the crumb cake was awesome as well as there are real fruits on it (banana). i wouldn't mind going back there again, in fact, we are planning to go back to try out their sandwiches and for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
i really love this little gem! been here twice for brunch, once for lunch and twice for dinner. this isn't your typical &quot;sit down dinner place&quot;. but for me, that's perfect because sometimes i like light dinners. like a sandwich and salad. went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too, tacos are great! i guess you can say i'm a regular now and i'm proud to say that! i especially love that pappas supports and practice sustainability! awesome craft beers on tap and bottle. wine selection is great too! i love the music they play as well, which creates a cool environment. hands down the best new restaurant east of kellogg hill :)
absolutely fantastic little place in la verne. in the two weeks i have lived in the area, we have been here twice and i am can see this becoming a weekly spot for my little family. the space is open and pleasing to the eye, no too hipster, but hey just hipster enough (har har). i love the funky, mismatched furniture and teensy vases with wild flowers on each table and the nice, open feel to the place. the welcoming atmosphere makes this a &nbsp;great place for families, younger people, and &quot;older' patrons alike! i love seeing a mishmash of everyone enjoying a good meal when i come here.on to the food: they have awesome daily specials, however what i have been most impressed with is their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! they have the loveliest little 4 ounce burger and chips plate for $6.00! their prime rib sandwich is also divine, &nbsp;the meat is tender and juicy. even my picky 9 year daughter loves coming here and has raved about both the hh quesadilla and the children's pasta. they have great rotating beers on draft as well. service has always been prompt and friendly. first time visitors: be sure to check in for your churro treat, you will not be disappointed.
i've been coming here about twice a month for the better part of a year and i think it's time i gave them some props. i've been here for weekend brunch, lunch, and dinner. this place is delicious and uses really fresh and high quality ingredients. i love their lunch specials and often get a 1/2 sandwich and salad combo. they also have great baked potato fries and good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. i am a big fan of their agua fresca drinks which change regularly. the employees are also friendly and give good recommendations. the only downside is that they are a little expensive, but the quality of the food explains the extra cost. it's a little bonus that i get a discount because i am staff/faculty at the university.
good food! the staff is friendly, the food is good, the price is right...what more can you ask for? :)this is our third time here. the last time we came, i ordered a sangria. it was so good, i ate the orange slices when i was done! food wise...their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> wings are a good deal. &nbsp;the only problem is that the taste stays with you! the ramen i had was just okay. &nbsp;the best part about it was the tender slices of miso pork. &nbsp;i didn't care for the broth though. i had to use hot sauce to mask the flavor.my husband had their reuben sandwich and enjoyed it. the chips were very good! i enjoy coming here. ;)this evening my daughter ordered the fish and chips special. &nbsp;i couldn't believe how generous the fish serving was! &nbsp;her chips were good too.my salad was good. &nbsp;very tasty rotisserie chicken. &nbsp;the dressing was light. i enjoyed it. &nbsp;a lot to eat too!my husband and son both enjoyed their burgers. &nbsp;everyone was <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, <span class="highlighted">happy</span>! the best part, though, were the free churro with a check in! yum!
while my favorite item served here is still the ever-popular, utterly delicious chicken sandwich simply termed &quot;the signature chicken sandwich,&quot; and the market vegetable sandwich is still fresh and amazingly filling in its own right, i think something need be said about their enormous veggie burger. we are talking, the king of all veggie burgers outside of &nbsp;an la hipster joint. at the risk of sounding like guy fieri from 'diners, drive-ins, &amp; dives,' i actually thought i'd have to dislocate my jaw to bite into this thing. the texture of the patty itself is hearty, it isn't gamey like some processed veggie patties, (probably due to the fact that it's made in house). whatever seasonings and sauces they put in this thing, they're doing it perfectly. served in a brioche bun with a fried onion ring in the middle, this burger will make you wish you had two stomachs so you could order another one. almost everything here is made in-house with fresh, local ingredients. and their coffees, particularly their cold brew and iced caramel latte, are absolutely delicious and perfectly balanced. and if you're a booze-lover, you're in luck! their craft beers and cocktails alone are worth coming here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the menu, overall, is unique and diverse; sure to please just about anyone who walks through those doors.
1st time, it was a yelp tasting event. tried few thingskettle chips- too salty for my likingpotato wedges- i only like crispy skinny fries, so this one wasn't to my liking either.signature chicken sandwich- amazing, the only place can compete with it was the one in sf near pier 33.al pastor sandwich- too much sauce but it wasn't bad. i don't like anything when you eat the sauce is dripping make finger dirty.few different kind teas- were served in dipping sauce kind containers so because i was thirsty they were all good but wasn't enough to quench the thirst at all. (for the amount served it's hard to tell if it is good )churros- i don't like this soft version churros but it was hot and fresh so some people might like it.2nd time, we met there for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4-6pm)we managed to arrive 10 mins before 6pm and placed our order. the waitress said as long as she put the order in computer before 6.kettle chips ($0.5)- still don't like it, my dining partner ate most of it. i don't feel it much different from a bag of chips.d street burger ($6)- i asked for medium rare but it was more like medium. not bad but i wasn't impressed.street taco ($1.5/ea)- meat was very dry and over cooked. avoid!!! worst taco ever.peach oolong tea ($2.5) i normally like anything unsweetened but this one is slightly bitter. not much of a peach.churros (free with check in)- tried again but still didn't like it.the environment is very pleasant and quiet. perfect for hang out or alone reading a book. service was very nice. i just couldn't give this &quot;might be a gem in la verne&quot; place more than 3 stars because most of its food fall into fancy but mediocre taste.
came in on a tues at about 1 :30pm, not many people, but steady as peeps came in to pick up phoned in orders.service was walk-up and they bring the food to you when it is ready. the space is really cool, nice open, bright space decorated very nicely in that industrial look. great outdoor patio, and its bigger that it looks from the outside. on the south end of d street right in the heart of dt laverne. **we tried**melon-ginger aqua fresca, lemon ice tea, onions rings, albacore sandwich, chicken jalapeno soup, and the chicken sandwich.here are my thoughts:the agua fresca, which i was so looking forward to, was a little disappointing. (they do give small samples which was really nice) today the choice was melon-ginger. &nbsp;i was expecting a refreshing melon aspect but just wasn't getting mouthwatering melon-ness. i would like to try other flavors sometime. the lemon iced tea just tasted weird. real lemon in regular black or green tea would have been better i think. lots of beers to choose from.the soup was good, hearty, and piping hot. i love that! maybe a little thicker, throw some corn in there and it would be crazy delicious.the sandwiches were on the skimpy side. i wish they were bigger, juicier, messier, hotter, and had more wow factor upon presentation, ie. &quot;i'm not sure i'll finish this&quot;. the chicken one needed more chicken, more sauciness, and some other note, the flavors were a bit muddied i thought. but it was still good, solid 3 stars. i liked the flavors, especially the albacore--fresh chunks of tuna, lightly covered in tartar sauce, and fresh herbs. i felt it needed more of the shaved fennel. i liked the arugula on it. i tried it dipped in a bit of their green goddess dressing and it really turned it up a notch.the onion rings were mostly &nbsp;limp strips. the flavor was fantastic but they would have been easier to eat and more enjoyable had they held their shape a bit more. they came without dipping sauce, so i asked for ranch. no ranch, but &nbsp;they had homemade green goddess and sriachia aoli. i requested both. man, the sriacha was fantastic! i suggest they serve these two on the side for every order. bet it would be fantastico on the baked potato fries too!!all in all, this place has great potential. i love the concept and hope more people go and try it. a few tweaks and i am sure it will be a 5-star. look forward to going back soon. looks like they have some great brews on tap and a promising <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
so, a friend told us about the potato nest. i hopped on yelp and read about these exotic unique iced tea flavors and between the two, i was sold. went down there and this place is great!! i rarely give 5 stars, but it's under $10, the food is fresh, creative, unique and eclectic (not to mention scrumptious). the iced teas are killer and i want to order everything on the menu. the also offer beers on tap and wines too. very foodie friendly.speaking of the menu, it's perfect--it offers just enough to be interesting and is diverse enough to satisfy whatever craving i might be having at any given moment, but it isn't so overwhelming like some places where they try to do everything so nothing is really done spectacularly. i was really impressed that the chef was also out wiping down the glass doors when there was a lull in customers and when i talked to him about the food, he was passionate but not hell's-kitchen-obsessive-unpleasantly-ocd-and-snobby passionate. i love that he's proud of his food and skills, but not too proud to help out elsewhere around the store! and the owner, matt, was incredibly gracious and friendly. in fact, both the servers were too. i love it when a restaurant smiles.it's got a little bit of an industrial, hipster, modern warehouse feel with lots of wood, concrete, metal and chalkboard decor (think eureka burger in claremont with more natural lighting and no booths). its counter service, so if it's busy, get someone to grab a table (there's plenty of seating, thankfully) and bring some menus back to the table to mull over before ordering. i think there's a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4.30-6.30 in the afternoons and a sunday brunch, which they close at 3pm.they've been open a grand total of 14 days, so there was a tiny hiccup or two, which they fixed...with a smile. i have a feeling this place is gonna take off...i sure hope so!! but don't make the place a madhouse and make the lines too long. i need my iced tea! go matt and travis!p.s. i read a filtered review that complained about $9 sandwiches. i'd agree $9 is too much...but i think they may have changed their prices in response b/c i don't remember anything being nine bucks. i think the prices are okay for what they're offering. i certainly wouldn't complain if they lowered prices, but i also don't feel like i'm being robbed and i definitely walk away full (unlike at sushi joints, which i love, but where i plunk down twenty bucks and then still have to stop by a burger joint on the way home).
this place: cute and has some of the friendliest customer service i've experienced in a while. the place seems super nice inside, very homelike and welcoming. pappas artisanal has a dog friendly patio with some shade (wear sunglasses and sunblock.. both the husband and i got a little sunburned after just a few <span class="highlighted">hours</span>). the patio has a few picnic tables in located in the front of the restaurant. i was looking to have bottomless mimosas brunch on a sunday, somewhere were i could take my little pooch too. we thought it could be a bit more crowded being that it was a beautiful day that weekend but thankfully it wasn't. we were seated and helped right away.the food:we looked over the menu a few times and yelp of course. we did realize that during brunch they only serve brunch. there is some brunch specials that are not on the menu that you can ask your server to provide. my meal was one of them. i ordered the chicken and waffles to go with my bottomless mimosas. their meats are all hormone free which mean great quality. the chicken was non-greasy and not overly battered. i honestly loved that. the waffle was good too, nothing special about it though. the chicken is what made the dish. bottomless mimosas served from 9.00am to 2.00pm ($15). you have the option of choosing agua fresca or orange juice, and our awesome waiter mentioned that i am more than <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to alternate if i wanted to try the agua fresca one too, which i did. both are delicious and did the job of getting me real buzzed.service: outstanding. we had more than one waiter/waitress come around and check up on us to make sure we were doing alright. they also brought out a water bowl for my doggie and made sure he had clean water all the time. i also loved that they did not slow me down on my mimosa intake haha. woo!!tip: check in on yelp and you get some hot and fresh churros which are amazing!! you will totally not regret it at all. ****dog friendly*****#125/2014
this place is awesome. my girlfriend and i happened upon this place based on the fact that they hook you up with a churro if you check in here. so glad we did!we came in to eat a little something before we went on a run, we ordered the pap pap wings and our free churro. the wings were like no wings i have tasted before, they had their own sauce and they were full wings they were tender and juicy. i liked everything about them. the churro was also really good. it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and very flavorful. and everything we ordered was hot! always a plus. the owner actually came out and talked to us for a bit while we were drinking some water and hanging out the place has a &quot;i'm home&quot; feeling to it. all our food was gone so we left and ran our run. we decided to go back for dinner. we live in northern california in the bay area so we wanted to try their dinner menu while we still could. we were greeted with warm welcomes since they recognized us from a few <span class="highlighted">hours</span> before and were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to see us. we sat down and out server was cole. he was super attentive and answered all of our questions. we asked if we could try their specialty home tea drinks and he brought us out little tasting cups totally above and beyond. we got a tea and the mule (vodka and ginger beer).we ordered the fried brussel sprouts and burrata for appetizers the brussel sprouts were cooked just right and covered in this amazing citrus juice. and the burrata was sweet and the squash was perfect. the bread was toasted and warm and amazing. i would almost classify this as a dessert is was so delicious.for main course i got the pappas braised bacon ramen, and my girlfriend couldn't decide between the catch of the day (yellow tail and fennel and farro) or the pasta special (fusilli and white sauce) soo we got both. we normally share everything we get anyway.the ramen was amazing. the bacon was (just like everything else) cooked to perfection and it was served in a cute asian style cooking pot. it was hot and had just the right amount of everything in it. the yellow tail was also very good it had fennel which i only recently discovered as an eatable and i have learned i really like it and farro with is like oatmeal and rice had a baby. the pasta was my girlfriends favorite. i snuck a few bites in here and there, but she was all about it. it had little bits of some kind of meat in it (i saw it but didn't eat enough of it to be able to tell you what as it was being horded on the other side of the table) but the bites i did get reminded me of home cooking if your mom was a professional chef and knew what she was doing. it was really creamy and amazing.for dessert we just got 1 cookie we were stuffed and taking most of the food as left overs. but that cookie. i wish there were more left when we ordered as we got the least one, white chocolate chip apricot. heavenly. now the food was amazing. and the atmosphere was amazing. my girlfriend also was excited to hear they had little dragon pandora playing. but being a server in the past for years, i am very strict when it comes to my food servers. and cole was awesome. attentive, with all of the food we brought to the table he checked to make sure we were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with it. our glasses were never empty and actually spent time answering our questions and talking to us. i don't like feeling like we are just another table and always appreciate it when our servers care. and he got all of our order correct the first time. i can't say enough good things about the food, the dining room, or the service. this is a 100% going back next time i'm in so cal.

i love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!!!
saw that this place opened up and so wanted to check it out. we came here and it was dead empty, but it seems relatively unknown. it looks nice enough, and there's a few big tvs where you can watch games and whatnot. we got a combo meal, which only comes with coors lite(lame). fortunately they were out of coors lite and so we got upgraded to kirin for free. the salty nuts they give as free appetizers are interestingly tasty. they're a bit different from the average peanut, they're salty but have somewhat of a sweet tingle. for food we ordered the tong dak(full roasted chicken), which was just eh. after eating a little bit i was not impressed, i've had way better elsewhere. my friend also got these beef kebobs. they looked delicious, but i was fooled. i took a bite and it was so bland. there was sauce on it, but it definitely looks better than it tastes. not that it was bad, it was just so average.i'll probably come back here, if anything to check out the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and watch a game. it's ok. not good, not bad.
grand opening in diamond bar~really? i'm down to try some new places as usual....but.... unfortunately, i didn't like this place at all. &nbsp; the owners of new garden restaurant shouldn't have opened this place. &nbsp; however, the ambiance (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmnwxka4-ke9ewg-bmnog?select=aephmyfhho5dsgdmm3dc9q#aephmyfhho5dsgdmm3dc9q">yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmn…</a>) is great and there are a lot of tvs in here so you can enjoy a few drinks, music, and a sports game on tv. &nbsp;service is also pretty good and friendly. &nbsp;they do have a call button if you need them for anything.so we ordered tong-dahk and ddukbokki.the tong-dahk (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmnwxka4-ke9ewg-bmnog?select=lqz_gfz5al80yvfbrdnk3q#lqz_gfz5al80yvfbrdnk3q">yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmn…</a>) was not prepared well and didn't taste good. &nbsp;also, they don't have the standard machinery to make the tong-dahk, so it's just fried which resulted in it being super dry inside and lacked flavor. &nbsp;i still have yet to find a yummy tong-dahk spot around the sgv-ie area.the moo (cubed pickled radish) -http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmnwxka4-ke9ewg-bmnog?select=lv9f5myhzsmum1v8vvfrqg#lv9f5myhzsmum1&shy;v8vvfrqg. &nbsp;this was old and disgusting. &nbsp;it wasn't sweet enough. &nbsp;if you are looking for really delicious moo, go to bbq chicken in db for them.the ddukbokki (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmnwxka4-ke9ewg-bmnog?select=gzqhj0y5jak3jvk1pssktw#gzqhj0y5jak3jvk1pssktw">yelp.com/biz_photos/lwmn…</a>) was too sweet and salty. they put too much soy sauce in there and should have added more gochujang instead. &nbsp;they don't give you a lot of dduk, either. &nbsp;to me, again, bbq chicken stands #1 in quality (but not in price) when it comes to ddukbokki.the prices aren't really bad, but they aren't really good either with the portions. &nbsp;i'm hoping in the near future they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or specials with their drinks and ahnjoo. &nbsp; when they do, i'll be back and try out their other items. &nbsp; since they are new, i'll give them a few months to fix their food and menu. &nbsp;for the area, i'm only giving them 5 stars for ambiance, service, and friendliness. &nbsp;it's also known to be a good place to drink and chill with your friends, so food shouldn't be expected to be all that great.l

wings are awesome. tons of flavored to choose from. service can be slow. but overall a great place to come for beer and food. they have a solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is all day sunday and they have all kinds of other specials during the week.
wide variety of yummy wings * awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> * chill environment. contemporary decor. friendly staff.
great atmosphere and wings. we had the tequila lime, spicy cajun and the danger hot. the tequila lime was average but the other two were phenomenal. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> us super legit.
i wish i would have known of this spot sooner! i love it wings on point and the service was great and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is nice
used to be great, now they're awful. they used to offer half-orders of appetizers, not anymore. used to have $2 domestic pints, not anymore. want to enjoy food and drink when there's a ufc fight or other ppv event, be ready to pay a cover to get in. i ordered an appetizer off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and was brought what i ordered. little did i know, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and regular size plates are different. the server said i didn't specify &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; and the manager refused to reduce the price. on another visit, i was brought an appetizer that had been in the window long enough to overcook the cheese and make it hard and crusty. when i sent it back, the cook said, &quot;that's just how it's made.&quot;i used to love this place, now i will never go back.
came here for the ufc tonight and was having a good time ordering from their pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu...until the bill came. apparently the waitress assumed we wanted the full size order of everything and proceeded to charge full price for everything. when we explained we were ordering from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and pointed out that we had been pointing to the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu as we ordered the manager only offered to discount a portion and refused to work with us. instead of earning loyal ufc customers they lost them for good. we paid the bill and will definitely not be coming back. personally i think the waitress purposely put in the full size order. if you have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> going on they should be be confirming what the order is. bad management and leadership.
i really enjoy their food. i can't complain about that. i bring all my friends so we can hang out and have good food. the problem that they have is their service. when you dine in. it takes forever for the waitress or waiter to pass by. they run out of drink menus that they have to be passing it around the ones they find. don't like the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. when you think of &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot;. you think of drinks, you don't want a free soda before 5pm. &nbsp;you don't want to wait till 9pm to start to drink. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> should start earlier especially after work. another annoying thing is their carry out. they never answer the phone the first time that we need to call back two or three times.
very solid place for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ton of tv's great bar great atmosphere. service is ok, however there drink specials and food is great. would recommend going
great atmosphere only sit outside if you don't mind smoke, &nbsp;don't get well drinks during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they are watered down stick to what's on tap or bottles, &nbsp;slow service on farmers market day thursday, &nbsp;dirty patio. food is ok had better wings elsewhere over salty.
so far so good. food is good. large beer mugs. friendly service today. the beers are huge!!!!! they've got a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and they show all the games. you can even request ones that aren't playing.we are huge ku fans (husband's from ks) and they played it on the huge screen for us. we had a lovely waitress xanthe. she was so nice and always checking up on us.
update to my past review, the problem was with the online delivery, since that review they have not made any mistake with further orders. i've always been a big fan of all the food, its very good. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great, and the wait staff is always very nice and friendly. i highly recommend this place, specifically if you are going to walk in, also its a good place for group events.
solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals! our waitress seemed to think they were a real bargain but i don't know if 1 dollar off a 9 dollar ipa is as much of &quot;a steal&quot; as she thinks. but nice try. our group ordered bbq and garlic parmesan wings, some buds and ipas, a french dip sandwich, a chicken caesar wrap with fries, and chips and salsa - thanks to the yelp check-in offer. they brought carrots and celery with ranch on the house as well.i was a fan of the wings! crispy, meaty, and dripping with sauce. my boyfriend and i shared the 12-wing platter - it was really yummy! my friends seemed to enjoy their orders. i tried a bite of the french dip sandwich, which was too salty for her to finish and me to try more than just a bite. the salsa was warm and chunky, and seems homemade. even then, you probably won't see me checking in a second time!
so...i have to say i have been here many times!! &nbsp;the boneless wings--they shrank about 3 sizes---tiny, tiny, tiny..totally not worth it! &nbsp;also, i have used many <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">restaurant.com</a> coupons since i dont know when, during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, this time not accepted....i was totally not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with that at all....supposedly they honored many of them, but mine! &nbsp;just not a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> experience today for me with house of wings.....definitely will b a while until i come back....unfortunately not the same customer service as other places!!
first time going to house of wings . went on a friday at 9pm. called 2 times before going for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> times had two employees tell me 8pm till close. i get there at 9pm waitress informs me it's 5pm-8pm. the service was slow and our waitress was negligent. &nbsp;had the buffalo chip app which was not good. the wings were edible nothing special. do not get tangerine flavor it had no taste. my first and last visit.
first time here. granted we got there not long before closing. quickly ordered. i had a buffalo chicken wrap and fries. it was decent. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> till close was nice. blue moon on tap, always nice. ill give the place another shot
this is a welcome addition to the very dead downtown la vernei have only been here during lunch or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so my review is based on that time frame. (i have heard they play loud club music at night, but i have had no such experience). service has always been friendly and attentive. for all you sports fans there are a ton or tvs!the wings are fantastic and certainly live up to the name of this joint. the menu is very eclectic including some delicious seafood and salad options. the portions are huge so i have made it a point to share. they have an ok beer selection including a few craft handles and a couple standard domestics. i was also impressed with their low price on buffalo trace bourbon $5 for a healthy pour and $4 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. my boyfriend has been brave with trying their specialty cocktails but hasn't been to impressed. it seems best to stick to beer or basic cocktails (ie. vodka cran, jack n' coke ect.) i will be back!
best sports bar i've been to in a while. the food was beyond amazing (lemon pepper, my fave), the sliders (with bacon), the irish nachos? must try! i love sauces, and their ranch especially (which is made in-house) is out of this world! there is literally a tv every 10 inches, so it's the perfect sports bar. lakers won last night, so it was particularly perfect. we were a party of 20, and the waitress (didn't get her name, but she was a short haired blonde), was on top of her game. overall, if you're in the area, looking for a chill spot to kick it with friends, or get plastered during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, this is the place to be.
we found this place on our way to the la county fair. stopped in for some weekend <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, before being forced to pay $9 for a beer at the fair. the wings are delicious! we ordered them buffalo style, extra spicy. also ordered the spicy fried pickles, but those werent spicy at all. but still very yummy. the beer specials were good. i think they offered bud light and coors light for $2.50 on hh. i ordered a couple sam adams octoberfests ($4) and my sister had a few miller lights. the service was good. they have a nice bar area and outdoor patio.
their service is top notch ! fast , friendly, and hardworking. you won't sit with an empty glass for longer than a minute, because the waitress is always there to make sure you are satisfied ! their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is awesome and their appetizers are delish!! we ordered 12 piece wings / 6 spicy bbq and 6 tangerine . my husband loved the spicy bbq however i wasn't really <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the tangerine , but oh well, will know for next time to order something else . my friend got me to try artichoke spinach on flat bread and it was amazing!!! same opinion goes to irish nachos ! yummy! great place to watch the game, get your booze in and have some good food!
been there 3 times now and food has been good just expensive in my opinion 8 bucks for zucchini fries and &nbsp;13 bucks for artichoke dip? &nbsp; i usually wait 10 min for a waitress and another 15 before i got my beer when its not even busy . the thing that really gets me upset about this place is there so called &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; for half the price at certain times you can get discount drinks and food but what you really get is just that half the drink or half the food. it's not the normal size bloody mary or normal size nachos it's half the size or less in my opinion for half the price which isn't a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they should tell you that on the menu because it's false advertising to have a &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu &quot; that's just smaller portions you end up paying the same amount if you want the full size. just don't be fooled by that, other then that the food is pretty tasty if you don't mind your wallet getting really light by the time you leave.
i am really disappointed about this placeit is bear our house and looks like a fun locationit was 4 of us with a very simple order including a salad and nachos we received the burgers and the wings 40 minutes later even though there was only 5 tables that had clients when i asked about the salad and the nachos that we ordered for appetizers, the server looked puzzled and was surprised that we did not get them yet, another guy came to confirm that we did not get the appetizers and looked puzzled as well. i told them that it is ok and that we do not need them since the food is already herea waitress came and looked mad when she questioned why we no longer need the nachos and saladsit was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but stil km was charged full price for the drinksthey still brought the salad and was charged 6.99 for it
i have visited this restaurant ever since it opened several years ago, but it has been going steadily downhill for the last few years. this most resent visit has been the worst.  &nbsp;this place is obviously known for their wings. i think that's the only thing i've ever ordered here. the service has declined steadily and seems to be regularly under-staffed.  &nbsp; &nbsp;i was seriously disappointed with the quantity of food for the price, only because i remember the original servings for less money. not to mention the non- <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price for a 28-30 oz draft pomona queen was $9! &nbsp;i usually order the 8 piece boneless wings with fries...now $7.99. not a horrible price if you get decent proportions. the chicken pieces were tender and the sauce tasty, but the pieces have steadily decreased in size. my biggest beef is the fries serving... i mean, really? is it that costly to put a few more fries on your plate, especially since the chicken pieces are smaller? when i brought this to the waitresses attention she even agreed with me!  &nbsp;so, in summary, it's tasty, but servings are small and a bit overpriced. now, the good part is they have good tv viewing from every seat for that great game!
when this place first opened, i was really excited, because i thought it was just what la verne needed--a laid back sports bar with cheap food and drinks near the college campus. however, with each visit, i have become increasingly unhappy with the overall experience and customer service.the wings are pretty good, and i'm also a fan of their salads and other entrees (chicken saut&eacute;ed with vegetables is my personal favorite). portions are large and perfect for sharing. however, prices have gone up significantly since they first opened--$15 for saut&eacute;ed chicken and vegetables?! definitely overpriced.as for drinks, they have some good micro brews on tap and a full bar. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials used to be awesome--$2.50 for a bud light, margarita mondays w/$2 (i think) off all margaritas, etc. this was the place to come, especially on sunday with hh all day! now, bud light is $3.50 (this is bud light we're talking about!), and the last time i ordered a margarita, i was told the special applies only to the house margarita (even though the hh menu on each table clearly says all margaritas)...lame. seems like they keep changing everything to make more money, but they're losing business in the process.they have trivia on monday nights with gift card rewards for the top 3 teams. this has always been an awesome way to relax after work on the crappiest day of the week. however, we were informed this week that gift cards may not be used on the night they are won; you must come back another time to redeem them...lame.overall, service is just ok (we're in there every monday, so we get taken care of pretty well, but it can take awhile to get our food), but all the (unreasonable, in my opinion) price increases and caveats to hh, gift card redemption, etc. are what's making my opinion of this place slowly decline. oh, and they scored a b from the health department and posted it inside rather than in the window like they're supposed to. bottom line is that they opened a sportsbar, and they need to start operating it like one.
first time ordering food for delivery and it was not a good experience. first off, it took an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and a half to arrive. food was cold (not a total deal breaker. we own a microwave and are starving), but on top of this, the order was also wrong. i asked for no tomato or mayo. sandwich had no tomato, but was completely dry. it was supposed to have ranch. they also put tomatoes on my salad and forgot the salad dressing. i called back and just mentioned the dressing (most important at this point, to make the food edible) and the manager offered to send the driver back, so now my food continues to get colder and colder and frustration over this crap meal i paid $40 for, grows and grows! i'm down the street!! ugh! just terrible... do not recommend delivery! what a waste. not <span class="highlighted">happy</span>!!
today, new years day, went to this place only because our favorite place two doors down (t phillips) was closed. but were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to give it a try, since we had not been there yet. &nbsp;first impression - very nice. decor was chic, and modern and very classy. &nbsp;they put money into this place. &nbsp;the hostess sat us immediately and gave us some water and said our waitress would be with us soon. &nbsp;a good 10 to 15 mins &nbsp;later the manager came over, explained they were short staffed and they weren't even going to open today. (they had &nbsp;maybe 6 tables with &nbsp;two people at each one) &nbsp; and asked if we wanted a drink. &nbsp;we said we were ready to order, food and drink. &nbsp;as we were telling him our order the only waitress in the place came and took the order. &nbsp;the rose bowl was on so we wanted simple bar food- nachos and wings. &nbsp;both were good, and that's why they get the two stars, because service was a negative. &nbsp;the waitress was nice and did well. &nbsp;the manager and the guy who looked &quot;ownerish&quot; &nbsp;in the yellow sweater vest. who kept peeking around the corner hoping the customers would leave so he could go home, both were lacking. &nbsp;they could of helped out. &nbsp;and here is the kicker.... just as service couldn't get worse it does! &nbsp;we are watching the rose bowl football game - this is a sports bar. &nbsp;about half way thru the second quarter we decide to order some sliders. &nbsp;they take all of 10 mins tops to cook. &nbsp;the waitress comes back to our table and says just so you know we are closing at 5:00. &nbsp;umm seriously - that is just over an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and a half. &nbsp;we told her to forget the order. and hand us our check. &nbsp;we figured half time was starting and we could get home before the second half started. &nbsp;a sports bar was going to close with customers still ordering and watching the game of the day? &nbsp;all the while mr. yellow vest guy kept peeking around the corner wondering how much longer he had to stay.this place could of taken advantage of the awesome t phillips being closed and showed us great service, so we would have to come back again and again. &nbsp;but they made it easy on us, we wont be back. &nbsp;we will be two doors down spending our $50.00 to $70.00 bucks a week. &nbsp;food was good. &nbsp;decor was good. &nbsp;service was terrible. &nbsp;the waitress was fine and got her 15% tip, we usually tip more. &nbsp;but the manager and yellow vest guy were pathetic. &nbsp;and whoever made the waitress come over and say they were closing in an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and a half was bad business. &nbsp;pathetic. &nbsp;either be open and serve your customers, or be closed - &nbsp;half ass, got you a bad review, and two people who wont be back.
boulevard-574-diamond-bar-3
love their sandwiches and potato salad. great atmosphere and inside and outside seating. great place for an intimate <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in the evening with plenty if beer selections.
the establishment used to be known as boulevard bagels but is known as boulevard 574, and now serve alcohol drinks. not sure if they are the same owner. my office recently moved into the building next door and i was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to be able to have a restaurant like boulevard 574 right next to us. so far, i have only ordered to-go on 2 separate occasions to try out different items from their breakfast and regular menu. the door leading to the establishment is a bit oddly placed, but it is the same door from boulevard bagels i am not sure if one could walk through the gated outdoor seating in but their main door is to the right parking lot, not to the left parking lot. first time i called in, no one picked up the phone. my co-worker next tried and they finally picked up the phone. they noted that breakfast <span class="highlighted">hours</span> were only until 11:30 so i couldn't order my breakfast wrap. i decided upon the goddess (avocado, spinach, cucumber, tomato, onion sprouts, with chive cream cheese on a whole grain ciabatta, served with a side of potato salad). my co-worker ordered the garlic &amp; herb fries to try. after 15 minutes, i walked over to pick up our ordered items. there definitely is a different vibe than before as boulevard bagels. the cashier was really nice. one thing that peeved me though was that after paying with my $20, she did not give me any change. yes, it may have been $0.29 but i would like to have the option of giving it as tip or not. since it was not just my order, i had to get change for my co-worker's fries as well. i did not speak up but it really just peeved me. the ingredients of the goddess were all very fresh. i'm normally not a all veggie type of sandwich person but the ingredients went well together and the bread was super fluffy and soft. very fresh. the potato salad was also very good. there were no ingredients overpowering the other. my co-workers garlic &amp; herb fries were also perfect. loved how crispy they came out and the flavors were very fresh. good portion and the sauce that came with it was really good match, with a little kick. the 2nd time, my other co-worker was able to get breakfast and he ordered a french toast (coasted in fresh eggs &amp; cream, pan fried with whipped cream cinnamon &amp; maple syrup) to try and i finally got my breakfast wrap (eggs, potatoes, ham, cheese, tomato, green onion, &amp; green chili). the breakfast wrap was a good portion and it came with salsa.more than 65'% of my wrap were all eggs and some green onion, ham, and some cheese. there weren't any potatoes until the last 35%. i was quite disappointed. as much as i love eggs, i would like a more balanced mixture of ingredients in the wrap. as always, all the ingredients were really fresh and the parchment paper and foil kept my wrap warm for quite awhile. great wrapping for a to-go item. as a co-worker said, boulevard 574 serves great good with irvine prices. it's great that a place like this has opened up in db and hope that they stay open for awhile. their menu is quite simple and the food more than speaks for itself. i cannot attest to the atmosphere of the establishment, the alcohol drinks, or the service from the servers but overall, they put out great food.
zendejas-mexican-restaurant-san-dimas
this place is cool, i enjoy the taquitos the most! very nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
the food is really expensive for it not being great. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu sucks!!!!. would rather go somewhere else. plus is the dodger game and chips and salsa. would not recommend this place go somewhere else. 2 shrimp tacos for $15.50??? are you kidding me? what a ripoff.
this review is on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it occurs between 3-7 pm. prices are great and around $4. however, there was only one server at the bar which made service poor. it took awhile to get refills, food, and bill. it wasnt the waitress' fault though. i blame management.
went there for the kings game, took them a half <span class="highlighted">hour</span> just to change one tv, missed 20 minutes of the game that i came on time for.chips and salsa were gone on one person before they changed the channel (asked 4 times).had 3 dos equis and one shot during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, bill came out to $37. i asked for taquitos twice and the waitress kept looking at me as if i had never asked, still never got them.i can't say the food is good since they didn't want to make me any.i left and finished watching the game at red robins, saved a lot more money, too!
lots of tv's, spacious, good place to watch a game. &nbsp;don't go hungry, the food sucks. &nbsp;ordered a sampler appetizer for $16.95, and got french fries, 4 cheese sticks, a few poppers and 4 wings! &nbsp;that's it!!!! &nbsp;for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they will try to sell you 3 tacos for $6.50....what a deal! &nbsp;memo to zendejas, have you ever heard of $1 tacos?????
yuck! went there on saturday night with my boyfriend, we sat in the bar. &nbsp;there was a menu on our table that said &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, every day 3-9p.m.&quot; &nbsp;we were there this past saturday night at 7:30 p.m. so we figured we'd order something from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;once we decided, a waitress came over (it took quite a while for her to get to us and it was not crowded) to take our orders. &nbsp;she saw us about the order something off of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and told us that was only monday through friday. &nbsp;we politely pointed out that the sign said &quot;every day&quot; in big bold letters. &nbsp;she said it used to be every day but not anymore. &nbsp;my boyfriend told her she should probably take the sign off the table then since they weren't honoring their own signs. &nbsp;she told us no because they want the customers to know thee was a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;she did not handle the situation well at all and just kept saying &quot;ummmm&quot;. &nbsp;we ordered 2 beers and decided to just leave after that and eat and rink somewhere else. when my boyfriend gave her a card to pay with, she said we need a $10 minimum to pay with a card. &nbsp;we were already frustrated with the misleading signs all over the tables and just wanted to get out of there already so he ordered a shot and we left right away. &nbsp;it was nasty inside and the cover band was horrible.
this review is for the margaritas only. my boyfriend and i came for a couple <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> margaritas a few weeks ago and literally took two sips, paid, and left. the worst margarita i have ever had in my life. i saw the bartender shoot something out of the gun into it. perhaps water? because it tasted like a 5 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> old drink that they forgot about and served. we left to casa del rey and went for the good stuff. if that's how the drinks taste, i can only imagine the food.
there's a mixed crowd of younger and older people.the dress code is relaxed, just a collar shirt and no baggy cloths. the live bands are good and the dj really plays the music we grew up with, combined with some top 40 music. the $2 tacos are bomb after drinking all night. the security is very aware and courteous. the only drawback is they no longer serve tacos on friday night. they only serve them on friday from 3pm-8pm for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $1 tacos $2 beers and $2 margaritas. they do have great band called &quot;steel rod&quot; every thursday with no cover charge.it could use some new furniture. overall, the atmosphere makes up for the average setup.
red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-dimas-2
pretty good. it sucks they don't have any <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. the waitress said the prices are low like <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but ehhh i can find cheaper drinks.food is always a plus! very nice bar area.
met some coworkers here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.....or so we thought. &nbsp;after a couple drinks we get ready to order some apps and the waitress tells us that they have done away with the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;a few of the drinks have prices that are more than the old <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but less than regular price. &nbsp;the food is good (hence the 3 stars), endless fries are great (we miss the basket of fries, ditch the hammered cup!), but please put some tequila in the margaritas!
awww-red robin. the best burgers and fries in town. i've come to this place so many times and the waiters and manager is always so nice. the wait is never more than a couple minutes and its a very popular spot. the food is great!! get the bbq burger it is delicious!! the steak fries are great too-add the seasoning and try them with the campfire sauce!! you can also have a basket of fries while you wait for free if you ordered a burger or sandwich-just ask.also they have a cool <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the freckled lemonades are great too-free refills and they have great raspberry and strawberry margaritas. give em a shot! its very affordable. 2 people can walk out completely satisfied for around $20. also they have a diced chicken parmigana pasta that is not on the menu-but they still serve it and it is great!!
i know red robin is that burger place that everyone seems to go to, but we had a freakin' blast!! there was four of us and we sat right at the bar top. the service was excellent!! tevan was a bar tender and he did a great job getting our food and drink orders out quick. not to mention that he put up with my loud (boston native) boyfriend with flying colors! automatic kudos if you aren't annoyed by the loudest person in the place. the drinks were great. not too weak but strong enough to give you that lovely buzzed feeling after a few. ;) the burgers as always were yummy! cooked perfect and just big enough for my boyfriend and i to spilt and still have room for our cocktails. we missed the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but we will be going back to check it out.
read some fellow yelpers reviews before posting mine. shaun is right. this one is the best of the rest. &nbsp;anaheim is unbelievably slow and west covina (closest to me) is a veritable zoo! &nbsp;always go to san dimas for our rr fix but ontario is only second cause of the distance! &nbsp;love the burnin' love burger. &nbsp;erin, the chief server in the bar area, is a god-send cause she always makes sure that glasses don't run dry and that's including water! &nbsp;the new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great if you are a beer person but not so much if you are a mixed drinks one. &nbsp;servers on the floor that are top notch are paul and steven (not sure on that second name but the young man looks like jim parsons).
coming back from vegas on a thursday night and driving on the 15, we weren't expecting a lot of traffic. &nbsp;to our surprise, the 210 west was packed, due to the closure of 3 lanes. &nbsp;we had to wait for almost 15 minutes to get to the next exit and found our way to red robin. &nbsp;we were hungry, and at the same time, tried to get to the restaurant before it closes at 10 p.m.we arrived at red robin at 9:50 p.m., and they sat us down right away. &nbsp;my friends ordered the root beer float with unlimited refills, a chicken wrap meal, and an appetizer combo. &nbsp;we were sitting at the dining area, but the waiter let me order from the <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> (8 p.m. to close) menu (thank you raul!), so i got myself a tap miller light and some appetizers. &nbsp;the refills were quick, and they even gave us extra fries to share. &nbsp;i would have to say that the food was ok, but the services were great. &nbsp;if i have the chance, i will definitely come back to this red robin again. &nbsp;oh, chaparral lanes (<a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.chapparral-lanes.com&amp;s=c6b27a13fdb3ea9d6cf2457f57995932fa52941cb8d5c981c9cadd62b83c9135" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chapparral-lanes.com</a>) is nearby!view my other reviews at: &nbsp;<a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fow.ly%2f5mbqa&amp;s=1a10e8d0460f5cb22f27c17d33bf53cdcad8017ac0bf317364b43f74560d8b6f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ow.ly/5mbqa</a>
applebees-san-dimas
well. it's applebees. standard american diet (sad) kid's like it. so that tells you a lot. sometimes i am forced to go here because a friend that lives close by wants a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink. or the nearby wine bar closed and this is open late for some food. i have yet to have any food item wow me. but they do have a <span class="highlighted">happy &nbsp;hour</span> with some discounted drinks and snacks. and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts again at 9 or 10pm for a late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. and they have a weekend <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;so that is a good thing. chips and salsa are not great, but decent enough for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. oh, the last time i was forced to eat there, they had some potato chips that were spiral cut russets with some pico de gallo and cheese dip. that was good with a drink. my friends loved them. &nbsp;and a nice simple caesar salad was safe. potato twisters, pretty good! <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-dimas?select=fdubr5es_kmqkammixr8ia">yelp.com/biz_photos/appl…</a>caesar side salad. safe. of course no anchovies. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-dimas?select=uhcbdtzbix3daibwik0dqg">yelp.com/biz_photos/appl…</a>blackened chicken pasta. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/applebees-neighborhood-grill-and-bar-san-dimas?select=wmlunxeengkc71sbgpbbuw">yelp.com/biz_photos/appl…</a>
it's an applebee's... you get good cheap food and a full bar! i can't really complain. this location is pretty busy but i've never had a problem with service or the food and they have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials.
this is probably the worst location i have been to. the service was terrible and their drinks are tiny. the waitress told us they were having their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for our drinks and they ended up being full price. my salad was covered in soggy tomatoes and there was barely any of the burnt chicken on it. i will never be back to this applebees!
when i was a kid applebee's was probably my favorite restaurant. i'm <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to report that my tastes have evolved. we had an early dinner here about a week ago on our way to san manuel. fortunately, we arrived right before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended so we were able to order half price appetizers. in fact, that's about all we ordered - boneless buffalo wings, spinach dip, chicken sandwich sliders, french dip sliders and some kind of chili nachos. i'm not sure what the difference is between appetizer sliders and entree sliders because they appeared to be exactly the same and even came with fries. i liked the french dip sliders (not an app) although the bun was too fluffy, but the nachos were yuck. i liked how applebee's puts a little booklet with nutritional information on every table. of course after perusing it, you'll notice that very few dishes have calorie counts under 4 digits. in fact, i noticed that some dishes had like 10,000+ calories and i am hoping that they are indeed some kind of party platter for 100 people. there's a time and a place for chicken fingers and other junk foods and if the mood hits, applebee's is a good place to go, especially with all the deals they have going on now.
i can't speak for other locations; but, my local applebee's is amazing!!! i love coming during their famous <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3pm-6pm and late night at 9pm-closing. i've been going quite often, than normal. in my opinion, the food is great and well prepared, as well as the drinks. i really like the customer service given, even when you're one of the familiar faces or running into a familiar face, i.e customers of mine or old friends from school, it's always a good time!! especially when the bartender and waitress, know you as a &quot;regular&quot; of theirs, makes the experience even better!!all in all, applebee's, san dimas, is very welcoming, clean atmosphere, and very attentive!! i love it there!!! =d
first time at an applebee's ever...the restaurant is about 5 minutes from me which makes it super convenient.came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which means half off drinks &amp; appetizers (except for the appetizer sampler which is $2 off). &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> runs m-f 3-6pm &amp; after 9:00 pm. &nbsp;i don't know if this applies on weekends.the second we walked in the restaurant a friendly young man greeted us and showed us to a booth. &nbsp;he made small talk along the way which was nice.our server came by 5 minutes or so after we sat down to take drink orders. &nbsp;drinks came relatively quickly and then it was time to order an appetizer.our server was friendly, casual, and great. &nbsp;he was very patient and thorough when answering questions.toward the end of the meal the manager came by and cleared our plates (very impressive) and gave us a $5 off coupon for our next visit and a 'very important neighbor card&quot; (essentially a punch card which after 4 more visits will get us a free appetizer and after a total of 10 visits will yield a free entree.the restaurant reminded me a bit of a joe's crab shack, a slapdash collection of objects thrown on the walls, and lots of wood paneling. &nbsp;the restaurant isn't very big but we didn't feel cramped. &nbsp;there is a bar in the center of the restaurant with a flat screen playing sports.the menu--appetizer sample: $10.99 (normally $12.99) chips, artichoke/spinach dip, quesadilla, cheese sticks, and boneless chicken wings. &nbsp;it's served with marinara sauce that was bit runny for my taste, fresh salsa, ranch, and blue cheese. --half rack of baby back ribs. (i don't remember the exact price because we did the 2 for $24 deal). &nbsp;the ribs were good, served with coleslaw, and fries. &nbsp;they also come with another appetizer, i chose onion rings.--9 oz sirloin. &nbsp;perfectly cooked at medium rare. &nbsp;it didn't require any steak sauce. &nbsp;served with veggies &amp; garlic mashed potatoes. &nbsp;($10)--sizzlin apple pie ($5.99). &nbsp;served sizzling in a skillet. delicious. &nbsp;this is sort of a deconstructed apple pie: very little crust--more like a light crumble, plenty of apples, vanilla ice cream, and caramel sauce served on the side.beverages-long island iced tea. &nbsp;(i had 2 for $8) &nbsp;my first time having this cocktail and i found it a bit weak, &nbsp;i didn't taste all of the various liqueurs added into the beverage.--merlot (2 glasses for $6). &nbsp;i didn't order this, but my companion enjoyed it.total bill without tip came to $59.79.the appetizer sampler is huge (i would have been fine just ordering that and drinks). &nbsp;i had lots of good to take home.overall the experience was ok. &nbsp;nothing was spectacular, but i will come back here again.
even though it was a busy saturday night we were seated within 10 minutes and i was relieved since we had our 2 year old with us. we would have liked a booth but wanted to be seated quickly so we went to a table. the tables in the back of the restaurant are really close to one another. i was sitting within inches of another large size family and felt bad when i had to stand in order for their little boy to go to the bathroom. because the tables are so close, it's hard not to feel like you are in the middle of others conversations. they really need to fix their layout or somethin because i can't imagine bringing the rest of my kids or a group of friends here without feeling crammed in. but our visit wasn't all bad. we ordered the pretzel bread and beer cheese for an app and holy sheez it was awesome. for dinner i ordered the goddess salad and it was huge. i was full just eating that and the bread so i boxed up my chicken wrap. my date ordered the shrimp and chicken tequila plate (not sure what it was called exactly) and i tried some and it was great. my son had the mac n cheese (he had just woken up from a nap so we didn't want to give him something adventurous and piss him off) and he ate all of it and it was a pretty big portion. his fries were really salty though. the service here is not excellent but it is pretty damn good considering they were so packed and busy. they have a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal every day and if the manager doesn't come by, you can get 10$ off your next visit. he came by and was very friendly. i even saw him picking up tables and being talkative to the waitstaff.

the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around.. $5 foods drinks for under $4i will be back!!!!!!!!!
sweet waitress, great tempura avocado, potato skins and steak sandwich. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best in town, 430 till 8. &nbsp;very good martinis.
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is one of the best around i believe. the best part is they have some really really good bands play there, and that's when i go.
stopped by for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! sweeeet! awesome drinks at a great price!! $6.00 martinis!! bartenders, t and danny &nbsp;make awesome.... strong!! drinks. they are very attentive. tried the artichoke and chopped chicken salad off of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu... quite tasty! hard to find a place with a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>... this place does the trick!! they have live music too at 9:00. i'll definetly be back!
i've eaten here many times and overall had a pretty good experience. the steaks are great and if they still serve it... add the bacon wrapped shrimp. they are definitely the best item i've had there. i also enjoy having a drink in the bar area during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it's very spacious and the bartenders are great.
we often visit for the weekday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and make a dinner out of the appitizers. we also visit frequently for monday night football. free food, great drinks, prizes, and a fun crowd. if we are lookimng for something a bit healthier, we get the salad bar. we have so many favorite employees, it is hard too pick one. we can recommend jonnie, colleen, yvette, jenny, holden, and danny. these are just the names we remember. the others are good, too.
this is my second time here. first time was for my father in law's birthday (had a blast and the food was great). now i'm meeting up with my husband to watch the game. every monday during football season they offer free <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> hotdogs and chips, plus 1/2 off drinks and appetizers. you can't beat that! so far i've ordered a &nbsp;shrimp cocktail (delicious), fried calamari (i've had better), draft beer, and helped myself to a hot dog (yummy). they also did a raffle which was fun even though we didn't win this time.
ribs were bad. these ribs are the type of ribs that made me think i didn't like ribs for half my life. difficult to eat. definitely needed my knife and the little wipey towel afterwards. these are the type of ribs that my dad would get mad at me for when i was a kid. &quot;if you are gonna leave half the meat on the bones, then no more ribs for you!!&quot; &nbsp;good daddy!! cuz i hate them. they are hard to eat and not worth it!! no more ribs for me until years later as an adult and someone convinced me to try a tender baby back rib. well, it was a trip back to my childhood alright. and my daddy was even there! &nbsp;i glanced nervously at him waiting to be scolded for leaving so much meat on the pork rib bones. but, dammit, it was like crazy glued on there. not tender. the sides were a lightly steamed stalk of broccoli. good in my book since i hate over cooked frozen vegetables. my coleslaw was good. but i prefer classic coleslaw over the the peanut one they have. &nbsp;the tempura avocado was okay. and the chopped salad actually looked really good. but i am giving a couple of stars for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (half off drinks and free appetizers) and the fun saturdays i have had there when a band plays in the bar. now i have never seen <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> poppin and hoppin, but if you want a cheap drink and some snackies, its good. fridays and saturday nights in the bar can get packed when a good band is playing. as the prior reviewer stated, the service was good. i would give 2.5 stars if i could but i am rounding up cuz the service was nice and friendly.
awesome food, great service, and lots of fun!i had the salad bar, which was stocked with everything i could have wanted, and the smothered blue steak topped with blue cheese, mushrooms, and onions. &nbsp;it was cooked to perfection. &nbsp;i couldn't even order dessert i was so stuffed. &nbsp;our waitress was friendly and on top of it. &nbsp;after dinner, we moved to the bar where there was a band playing. &nbsp;they were so good, we ended up staying the rest of the night. &nbsp;i had so much fun!also, while i was there, i noticed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials: &nbsp;half off all liquer!?!?! &nbsp;i will definately be coming back for that...
i do like the customer service i get from there. i would only caution that when you order steak, and order it medium well or medium that you cut into the meat before you eat it. reason for this is because this place is dim already but i did have the experience of a bloody steak when i asked for it to be medium cooked. however aside from that, they have no problem taking it back and cooking you up a fresh piece. also they are friendly there for this past experience. good choice of beers and the well drinks are well priced during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but beware. they use well liquors which means that if you drink 4 cosmo's and 3 vodka cranberries, you will wake up with a headache the following morning lol.
came here friday night for drinks and steak. &nbsp;walked into the restaurant and was overwhelmed by the bathroom stench. &nbsp;turns out the bathrooms are located right where the maitre'd stands, by the entrance. &nbsp;the smell turned my stomach. &nbsp;hubby didn't smell it, but i have a keener sense of smell than he does. &nbsp;anyway, i had the all you can eat soup + salad bar. &nbsp;eh. &nbsp;salad bar is ok, not bad. &nbsp;but i can get the same stuff at sizzler for half the price. &nbsp;hubby ordered ny steak and baked potato. &nbsp;steak was perfectly cooked to order and was delicious. &nbsp;we also had fried calamari for appetizer - delicious with the horseradish and marinara sauce. &nbsp;drinks are half off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but only if you're in the bar. &nbsp;i had a margarita, hubby had a beer. &nbsp;paid full price because we were sitting in the dining area. &nbsp;overall, it was a-ok. &nbsp;bill came out to $70+ plus tip. &nbsp;i'd go again, but will hold my breath as i enter as to not smell the stinky bathrooms. &nbsp;staff was very pleasant, parking is easy.
the lounge has great entertainment and a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> no one can compete against. however the biggest issue in the lounge area is the seating. due to a recent pattern the seats in the lounge area are being mostly occupied by band members and their immediate families and friends. i have arrived at the restaurant at least 2 1/2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> before the band starts to see no tables available. and when there is a table available you will see one or two people holding a table that seats 10-12 people. yet the restaurant claims to have a no reservation policy. this is a policy i am not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about. the restaurant and it's management might as well reserve the lounge area for the band and its family members. perhaps a private reservation?either change your current reservation policy or continue to lose customers who were instrumental in your continued success.as a local of this establishment and someone that was a frequent patron i will go elsewhere and join others who already have left because of this.

worst experience i've had here for a sunday night. tried to watch sunday night football and the tv was changed at the bar for one couple that knew the manager. multiple customers asked to have it put on football to no avail. staff was great but i guess you need to know the manager to watch what you want at the bar. i have had hit and miss experiences here that i think i won't ever be back. very disappointed and cannot believe one couple was given special privileges just for knowing the manager. food is great, staff is great but it was overall a bad experience especially since the specials/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was catered around football.
i go here all the time.it's a bar that i can walk to from my place, they typically pour generously, and the a lot of the food on the menu is really quite tasty. (try the pulled pork sliders, the hangover burger, and the apple salad)the service is usually o.k. the front of the house management seems to have a hole in it somewhere, but, overall, the service is pretty darn good.<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> are good, too. tequila tuesday and wing wednesday are a good time. i almost forgot to mention the hoot that is known as trivia night on tuesdays... you'll never win though, because there is a team of, what seems to be, four older super-geniuses that seems to win every time i go.plus, big screens to watch the lakers lose these past two seasons they've been open have been good, too. i can cry after each game over a generously pungent jack&amp;coke. &nbsp;that is all!
beware of the tap takeover, if it is a thirsty thursday &nbsp;and tap takeover you will not get <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> discount on tap take over beers , even though the flyers all over the inside says 2 dollars off all drinks, i even pointed out out to who i thought the owner was and he told me not on tap takeover even though i asked him the sign right in front of us that said all drinks. i've had it with this place, all the bad reviews are about service. &nbsp;and from my experience even the owner does not care about the customers concerns.we waited over 10 minutes to get just drinks and saw others in the same situation. there is no communication going on in this restaurant. we will be going else where from now on. they also rarely get what you ordered right on your tab.

i don't know if they have new owners or what but i thoroughly enjoyed my kobe beef sliders for $5 and lollipops (chicken wings with a sweet sauce) during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> the other day. &nbsp;it is pricy but you are paying for prime steak not choice. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is best in the evening and their bar is unreal.... johnny walker gold?? hello, winning!
just had lunch with my friend jacqueleen and we had a pleasant time. pedro and miguel were our servers and did a phenomenal job. i love the ambience of this place. i also just found out they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4 to 8pm. $5.50 for all appetizers and $3.00 on selected wines. and to top it off they have dancing fridays and saturday nights :)
let me start by saying this place has gone through many changes mostly positive. they have always been known for their steaks which are delicious and the quiet ambiance. &nbsp;after adding a pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu they started to receive a more lively crowd especially on the weekends. i have been coming to this location since it was the velvet turtle ...i'm aging myself. &nbsp;to tell the truth there are not many true steakhouses nearby. looking back at the reviews regarding treatment to customers, i have never been spoken to in a ill manner at this restaurant. &nbsp;if &nbsp;anything the professionalism this establishment provides lacks elsewhere. will i give them 5 stars no, only because there is always room for improvement, that being said i will continue to frequent this establishment . good food, cordial staff, and overall great service keeps me coming back
this place is great!!! the service is fantastic. i have never been to a place that every single person there makes you feel like you are their only table. they are all very professional and they know the menu very well. all of the servers have been well trained. i have not only eaten in the restaurant, but also have had after work drinks at the bar. there is a tender there by the name of nick. he might be one of the best drink mixers i have encountered outside of big clubs in la. i was there with my gf and she wasn't sure what she was in the mood for, so he said let me make you something and if you don't like it the next drink is on me. he made her some sort of concoction and served it to her. she was amazed! when she asked what it was called, he had no name for it. it was something that he created himself. i thought that was great. back to the food. i have been here many times now and have almost tried everything on the menu. the steaks are fantastic. i prefer the baseball cut or the rib-eye. i am not a big cooked fish guy so i didn't care for the salmon to much, but for starters i like the calamari. most of the time i start with the fresh ahi. it is so good. not only that but it is half off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i would recommend this place to anyone. covina has bj's and chili's and other restaurants that are cool to hang out and eat with a few drinks. covina lacked a steakhouse. before hamilton's i would have to drive to fullerton or pasadena to get a good steak. it is nice that this quality of food is here in covina. the prices are no different from any other steakhouse i have been too. actually the drinks are cheaper than any steakhouse i have been to. i am glad that blake's is gone and hamilton's is in. although hamilton's is not doing a champagne brunch like blake's did, this place is much much much better than blake's ever was. so go and treat yourself and have a good time.
finish-line-sports-grill-pomona-3
cool place for lunch specials and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals are good. deals change everyday. waitresses are very nice.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 9 p.m-closing cant beat $3 drinks!
menu says <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts at 7. waitress told us kitchen not open til 7:30. we didn't get our food til almost 8. not a good place for young generation to hang out
great selection of crafted beers. waitresses are very nice and fast working. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials during the week it does get very busy during the weekend but other than that it's great and they &nbsp;also have a touch tunes box and it has a great selection of music to pick from
taco tuesdays is the best deal in town. &nbsp;nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, good bar food (like the nachos and mozzarella sticks, yum!) &nbsp;they have been the location for the san dimas &amp; la verne chamber's hype (helping young professionals excel) program for the past several months and the attendees have enjoyed their time (and drinks!)
best waiter i ever had! he was funny, nice, and actually remembered our order down to every detail! love their 9pm-closing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the food was good too, i esp. liked the burger bun they had. it was pretty empty on a thursday night but if you're looking to just dine out with friends and have a few drinks then i would def. come here.
great &nbsp;sports bar with several large screen tv's. any good sports bar will have different ways of making revenue during main events like a ufc fight. some may charge a small coverage charge after a certain time, so get there early, some places charge a fee to reserve a table, and some places even have a minimum amount to spend per person per <span class="highlighted">hour</span>.the decor is definitely what makes this an awesome sports bar and the game day specials for drinks is the best deal in town. it feels like its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day everyday. good times. the bartender provider excellent service and the food was just above average.i will be here a lot when football season kicks off.
bored? then go to finish line and bet on horse races and order some wings + beer! if you come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (3-7), you can get pitchers for $9 and some bar food for less than 5 bucks. i came here a few times and had a great time. they have satelite wagers for different race tracks, so that's kind of fun. if you just want to kill some time, bet $2 on a horse and maybe you'll win something! so far 2 for 2 for me! randomly bet on a horse and won enough money to pay for my gambling and food! pretty awesome! i would have given this place 5 stars, but if they are busy, you will have to wait quite a long time for your food and for service. overall, cool place to hangout!
luna-restaurant-and-nightclub-pomona
this review is only for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.i saw their sign outside saying they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on thursdays, fridays, and saturdays until 8pm (i think) which you normally don't see so of course the hubby and i were very excited to try it out. we went dressed very casually (myself wearing my work clothes and flip flops) and my husband just wearing shirt and jeans. &nbsp;when we first walked in there, it was dark and the first thing we could see was an abandoned hostess desk. we looked around and didn't see anyone so we ventured inside. to the left we saw the bar and headed on over there and sat down (not too much room i might add). &nbsp;just some bar stools and a few areas to lounge. (the crowd at the time looked like desperate guys hoping to score with some after-work <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ladies. where if they didn't succeed, they would just wait for club time.)we ordered a couple of drinks and some guacamole to nosh on. when the guacamole came out, i couldn't find the avocados! it was more of a green tinted salsa. and this cost $5 (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price). ummm...it was not worth it. acapulco <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> guacamole is $5 and is worth every ounce. not this stuff. it was an embarrassment to all guacamoles. as for the drinks, they were weak! my margarita tasted like it was mostly sweet and sour and my husband's mojito tasted like it was made of simple syrup only. we will never come here again.
nice club for the younger crowd nice &nbsp;music patio and scenery. &nbsp;dont try <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> we were on a girlfreinds weekend getaway in the area and went to <span class="highlighted">happy</span> and &nbsp;we were the only people in the place. we orderd shots of tequila and they had no limes. the appetizers &nbsp;tacos were good per my friends. i didnt eat so i cant say! &nbsp;the staff was friendly and accomodataing the bartender gave us a tour of the &nbsp;club and invited ups &nbsp;back that night.
we came here because we were staying at the shilo inn, and this was where the breakfast was served.the breakfast was mediocre: oatmeal, some fruit, sausage, a waffle maker, and bread and bagels. no eggs/omelette option (and i'm big on protein for breakfast, simple carbs will have me hungry in an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>!) so i was very disappointed with that. but then, the chef came out with a heaping plate of eggs! however, he gave it to a man at a table, sat down with him and started chatting. i asked the girl behind the bar if there was a way to get eggs, and i was told &quot;oh no, that man is a personal friend of the chef's.&quot; needless to say, i was not <span class="highlighted">happy</span>.also, there was orange juice that tasted as if it was made from tang, and cranberry juice that had to be powdered as well... it was awful. plus all the glasses were dirty. would not recommend at all.
pomona-valley-mining-co-pomona
we came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and we were in the mood for kitsch so the we loved sitting in a refurbished mine cart (circular, with padded seats). appies half off (get the steamed artichokes) as were the drinks. &nbsp;a wonderful view of the 10 freeway. and the 60 in the distances. actually, it was lovely surreal to be floating above the cars, from a glassed in perch. you don't hear any of the traffic noise. &nbsp;it was like having a drink at thunder mountain at disneyland.
only about banquet rooms... christmas party, dj, buffet style food was meh-- pasta something, lettuce something, fruit was good, chicken blah. bar for banquet room strong pours but with such a long line (thirsty crowd) i went downstairs to anthony. yummy pineapple shooters, kamakase, merlot house on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. beautiful views of the city lights, kinda romantic... avoid food, great venue for christmas party. valet!
perfect dining experience if ur out on a date. &nbsp;the atmosphere was great and beat part it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. drinks were cheap. now the bad partmy wife and i ordered our food. salmon and chicken. we was very anxious to eat but once we dug in we found the food was way undercooked. salmon was still ice cold in the middle and my chicken was still bleeding. &nbsp;i called the waitress over and she felt the salmon and first words were omg. i am so sorry &nbsp; then i showed her the chicken and again she said omg. she took both plates back and within 5 minutes brought us new plates. never before have i seen fish cooked so quickly nor chickens. but nonetheless we just told her to put it in togo boxes. &nbsp;very upsetting experience. &nbsp;for the amount of money spent on each dish u would expect cooked food even if the portions were minuet. &nbsp;personally i would not come back nor say it was a good spot. &nbsp;just make sure too check ur food before eating as this could happen to u.
we have been several times...before the new manager came there were several problems...most of which seem to have been resolved (even the employees seem happier). &nbsp;they have a very good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which can be enjoyed until 6:30pm. &nbsp;the atmosphere is very comfortable. &nbsp;the view is one of the best. &nbsp;we have never felt rushed. &nbsp;our waitress, that we now request (katherine r.) is a gem. &nbsp;the meals can be a little pricey but you are at a higher end restaurant not a cafe or grill type. &nbsp;now for picky picky...i don't understand why restaurants of this caliber cannot offer a baked potato without charging..or at least charging a reasonable price they are just too expensive. &nbsp;also the salad bar could use some upgrading. &nbsp;really picky, no reason to have fake bacon bits for your salad and baked potatoes. &nbsp;overall a very nice and pleasant place to enjoy a relaxing and quiet meal.
i'm pleasantly surprised!!! if you have driven east on the 10 fwy heading east i'm quite sure you have seen that old western building on the top of the hill! &nbsp;well ladies and gentlemen i'm here to tell ya, make a reservation~ you won't regret it! and for all you fellas who want to make an impression on ya lady friend, &nbsp;bring her here for dinner or sunday brunch. &nbsp;it's very quaint, &nbsp;a bit romantic and the staff are very friendly! &nbsp; can't comment on their entrees yet, that will come later. &nbsp;there menu covers just about everything from surf-n-turf to sweet treats. &nbsp;beer, wine and signature drinks. &nbsp;they also have a bar that appreciates us folks who enjoy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4pm-7pm tuesday-friday with appetizers 1/2 off! &nbsp;sunday brunch 9:30am-3pm with 5.00 off if ya get here 10! &nbsp;omg!!! i mean the list goes on and on!!! 10.00 off with ya yelp check-in!! food/drink porn overload~ brandee is the bomb. com! be sure to give her a sweet tip!
to quote &quot;tale of two cities&quot;; this place was the best of times, and the worst of times. &nbsp;having eaten at the various so. cal &quot;hill/view&quot; type restaurants; i.e. oddyssey in granada hills and castaways in burbank i pretty much knew what to expect coming to pomona valley mining co. &nbsp;i had eaten here before, but many, many years ago. &nbsp;you come for the view not necessarily the food, and you know the food will be ok, not great, but decent. &nbsp;the first half of the evening was actually really good and the party of 7 was generally <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the quality of food, the portion sizes and the service of our waitress. &nbsp;three of us had the filet and lobster and were quite surprised on the size of the lobster tails. &nbsp;they were definitely on the large size, which was good. &nbsp;one person had just the lobster tail, one had the ribs and two others had the king crab legs and filet (foreshadow alert!!).the food here was better than the two other locations mentioned above; we had drinks, a bottle of wine, and a few desserts. &nbsp;we spent roughly $500 for all this and left generally pleased with the experience........ &nbsp; &nbsp;but, that is where the two stars come in, and maybe, it should be one star.i will sum this up very quickly: &nbsp;two in the party got very sick a couple <span class="highlighted">hours</span> later. &nbsp;the two that ordered and ate the king crab legs and filet were both very sick later on. &nbsp;when you spend as much as we did for this meal, you certainly don't expect people in your party to get sick, but unfortunately, two people did. &nbsp;we all ate the salad bar, the bread, and shared a couple of the desserts, the people that ate steak and lobster had no issues. &nbsp;since we all ate the same steaks, i can only conclude that the problem was in the crab legs-----beware of the legs......too bad this happened, because aside from two people getting very sick, we had a good meal and a good time.
if i could give this place no stars, i would have done so. &nbsp;horrible food, lousy music &amp; food poisoning to boot! &nbsp;not a way to spend a holiday weekend! when we arrived, the parking lot was nearly empty, which was surprising for a sunday night at 7:00. &nbsp;we went inside, not sure if they were open, but they were, so we were seated. &nbsp;the first negative mark was the country music blasting from the speakers over each table. &nbsp;having to be forced to listen to that garbage is bad enough, but to have bad food on top of it makes it a joke. the menus came and we all kept looking at the 8 items listed wondering if we had been given special menus instead of regular ones. &nbsp;even basic pasta dishes were $25. &nbsp;each steak ($30 minimum) was listed as having some sort of sauce, cheese slices, bacon, or mushroom goop on it. &nbsp;right away that told me to be careful. &nbsp;any &quot;steakhouse&quot; that has to disguise their meat with sauces or cheese simply means they are giving you low-grade products that wouldn't taste good on their own. i ordered the small prime rib, rare. &nbsp;what i got was a large prime rib, well-done. &nbsp;the as-jus was fresh out of a bag, warm water added, meaning salty and disgusting. &nbsp;the potatoes on my plate literally collapsed within themselves, exposing potato powder that hadn't been mixed correctly. &nbsp;i pointed this out to the server who asked if i wanted more. &nbsp;more instant potatoes on my $30 plate, you mean? &nbsp;no thanks! i had seafood salad &amp; clam chowder from the salad bar and surprisingly the clam chowder was pretty good. &nbsp;the cheese bread they brought to the table could have been wrung out, it was so greasy, but i guess that is why it was tasty too. we left the restaurant not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with going there, but knowing it is a place to surely be avoided from here on out. &nbsp;however, the best was yet to come for me as three <span class="highlighted">hours</span> later i was doubled over with food poisoning which was determined to have possibly come from the seafood salad. &nbsp;i was the only member of the party to have eaten it &amp; the only one to be sick, even though my boyfriend was a bit nauseous for awhile after leaving the restaurant. &nbsp; do not visit this place. &nbsp;sure it has a view, but in the end, you can save yourself $30 a plate &amp; just go to a much nicer facility that has much better food. &nbsp;i would never recommend this place, to anyone!
fourth-street-mill-la-verne
server was very friendly, atmosphere was very nice in evening, the remodel looks great! &nbsp;not so stoked about early <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and prices. &nbsp;like others mentioned $8 for fries? &nbsp;i'd say prices are comparable to chases , i'll stop by for a few drinks and head over to wings, lordsburg or back abbey to eat.
location is great, construction and remodel was superb, it's a beautiful building. i was really excited to try this place. great place to drink. the beer selection was well thought out and deep. 12 taps to choose from and they're all worthy. the food was very good but my gripe is just the same as always, not enough. way too expensive for the servings. lettuce is cheap, fill the plate. i had an open faced sandwich with nothing on the side. my wife had a tiny salad. the kids had the antipasto which could have been much better if not minimized to salami olives cheese and lettuce. they need to learn what shoestring french fries really are and not charge $8 for a small scoop. a lot more generous with the portions, expand the menu, add a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, otherwise we'd rather drop this kind of change at the original chase's.
the-famous-glendale
great beer and liquor selection. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> goes until 8pm. find street parking, never use americana garage.
i'm not a big fan, but i appreciate the establishment here in glendale. typical <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices and so so whiskey concoctions that isn't much to brag about. nice decor, but a bit bright. dorky , aloof bartenders for the most part. plus , would be the big tv for sports.
great cocktails and whiskey/bourbon/scotch selection! will always keep me coming back. &nbsp;plus $2 off <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> til 8! :)
famous offers a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and drink of the day specials. service is attentive, not terribly friendly but efficient. nice &nbsp;place. big enough to go with a group of friends - but a bar intimate enough for a nice date.
omg! love this place! very spacious and not too crowded. and drinks are good with decent price for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. definitely will come back sometime with my girlfriend! friendly staff, clean environment!
love the atmosphere of this place. really cool. went in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and got $2 off our drinks. beer selections are great and the bartenders were really nice guys. keep an eye out for the specials written on the walls!
bingo! another fun <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with friends can be had at the famous famous. (it's not really that famous but you know? who cares.) my friend suggested the famous for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tonight without even knowing that they offer free bingo on wednesday nights! and, of course, she won the first round! two free beers, folks! 4/5: atmosphere. chill,very &nbsp;relaxed, movies on the tv (tonight, it was &quot;feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, it's bobsled time!&quot;), staff will change the tv to &quot;the game&quot; (whatever that means to you) if you ask nicely, free bingo on wednesdays from 8-11, and apparently, live music on other nights. &nbsp;5/5: drinks. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 5-8 = $2 off every drink. the bartender whipped up a special cocktail for me after i mentioned that i like a nice brandy alexander. so cool that he tasted it before pouring it in the glass and added more alcohol! all of us were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with our drinks. 3/5: dining. i had the &quot;greens&quot; (a salad with vinegar-heavy dressing) and the deviled eggs, which were actually quite good. overall, a nice, solid place to chillax with your friends.
we found this awesome bar as a result of a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp; you can tell the drinks are going to be made correctly by the fresh ingredients that are on the bar. &nbsp; i had a mojito &nbsp;and it was bommdigity! they shave some ice on the top of it and they are nice and strong. &nbsp; the food is not your typical bar food. &nbsp; the disco fries are so good, &nbsp;you must get them with the pork belly!
an alright place for drinks and trivia.an alright hh menu. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is until 8pm and it's $2 off drinks no specials on food. &nbsp;bummer. &nbsp;there's no server so you order at the bar. &nbsp;food is okay, nothing special. &nbsp;the disco fries are fries with stuff on top of it. &nbsp;nothing crazy. &nbsp;the ivy rose is a really good girly drink. &nbsp;parking is in the structure for 90 minutes or park at the mall.
solid bar located in the heart of glendale, directly across from the americana. the famous is great for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and they have a wide-ranging selection of both beer and mixed drinks. the ambiance is nice, and its central location means you can easily cross the street and explore the shops or grab some ice cream at the americana. based on its location, i am guessing this place can fill up quick on friday and saturday nights, so i definitely suggest you go midweek if possible.also the bartender, chris raba, is excellent. knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient. you'll know him by his signature curled mustache.definitely recommend :)
came here a couple more times after being introduced to it at a yelp event. love all the cocktails and the mustaches.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 5-8 m-f. $2 off cocktails, $1 off beer/wine.beer flight is $10 for 3.dimly lit for everyone's benefit.vagabond grillyard burgers in the back (one of my fave burgers this side of town)i wonder if the din tai fung buzzer works all the way here.....
the bartenders are awesome and nice. &nbsp;i forgot to ask his name but he was the bartender with tattoos wearing an s-mart t-shirt from evil dead. really nice guy and great bartender! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. try the mushroom tacos and the soft pretzel. so good! my only complaint is that when the clubs let out all the greaseballs like to come here for some reason. gross. there tends to be an excessive amount of dirtbags creeping around and it gets really uncomfortable. i'm usually ready to go by then anyways.
came here with my sister and her bestie for birthday drinks. vince, the owner was a sweet heart. he bought our round and looked out for us all night. cool decor and had an area for dancing, lots of seating and a cool vibe. the security guard was chill too. t the bartender was a sweetie and made our drinks really good. have to come back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> next time! we had a fun time, and will return.
this place has pretty good prices for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and at least some character in the soulless city of glendale. &nbsp;kind of hipstery, chalkboards on the wall, bartender with curly mustache, you get the idea. &nbsp;normally not a fan of that, but between soulless fake americana glitz and painfully forced hipsterdom, i'll take the lesser of the two evils. &nbsp;so in the fight between the famous and glendale, the famous wins. &nbsp;i never like to go to glendale if i can help it, but if i had to go get some drinks there, i wouldn't hate it here.
fancy drinks, craft brews and burgers can be obtained across the street from the americana.i suggested this place for a get together for a bunch of friends and we all liked it for the following reasons:- &nbsp;the bartender was nice. &nbsp;i can't stand snooty bartenders.- &nbsp;lots of places to sit for larger groups.- &nbsp;you can watch sports if you want on the big screens.- &nbsp;burgers can be ordered in back from vagabond grillyard which is different business.- &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. monday through fridayhere's some things i really didn't like:- &nbsp;the only food you can order is hamburgers. &nbsp; - &nbsp; the drinks seemed to be lacking in a sufficient amount of alcohol. &nbsp; i had two cherry-lime rickeys are barely noticed anything.recommendations:- grab dinner somewhere else if you don't feel like eating a burger.- maybe grab a shot of whatever spirit on the side to alter your drink.- grab a drink before dinner and do your own little glendale pub crawl.- go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because the prices are a bit steep otherwise.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was great! tried their daiquiri and it was refreshing and light, definitely will order again. my friend got two shots of whiskey and they were generous! one star deduction for the waitress who never asked us if we wanted more drinks, instead she would immediately turn around when she got to our table and get drinks for other tables. otherwise, great place to chill and have a drink or two...or three... :0)
i never thought i'd find a mellow, simply classy bar in glendale. i came here yesterday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and there was a cool crowd including the bartenders. many of the folks there were trying out their many shelves full of different kinds of whiskey and having conversation about their favorite one with the men behind the counter. the ambiance was awesome - i love the leather couch seating along the wall and the lighting was perfect. service here was spot on; my glass of water was never empty and empty glasses were bussed quickly. unfortunately my wheat allergy means i can't have whiskey, but the famous has a full bar as well as draught beers. they were very understanding regarding my wheat allergy and all the questions i had regarding their menu. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> consists of $2 off any of their drinks. i got the cherry lime ricky, and it tasted like a sour patch kid! then i got a moscow mule, and boy, drinks are strong here! i was done for the night. they also serve food - fries ($3), tacos ($7-8), buffalo wings ($10), and a burger - all decently priced as well. i'm definitely going to be back!
i used to really like the famous. then i came here on a friday night... it seems to attract the basest human beings possible on the weekend. it's loud, crowded, the clientele are despicable excuses for human beings (rude, loud, aggressive, and disrespectful - one man unsolicitedly told me &quot;women are disposable&quot;). plus the prices (if you're not here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>) are high, and the single-stall bathroom becomes a grotesque hookup zone as the night wears on. if i return, it most certainly will not be on the weekend. and the possibility is very low.
my boyfriend and i went here to check it out because we saw the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;board outside and it also looked like a classy lounge. we loved the inside urban decor and tv screens everywhere for sports or movies. it was a sexy whiskey bar with low lighting and my fave pandora playlist playing hipster bands and good tunes. &nbsp;we wanted to find a nice low key bar we could go to for date nights and well made drinks, this was the spot. we asked the bartender about their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the specialties. ordered some specialty drinks and they were rich, smooth, and delicious. def a legitimate whiskey bar. except for the misunderstanding with our bill, paying for full price instead of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (which we did ask the bartender), everything was great! they had friendly service and informed us about the live music on some nights, so i will be checking that out. great place to go get drinks while waiting for your table at the restaurants in americana.
this bar is awesome! it has a cool old school vibe and so many drink options to choose from. the bartenders are awesome and do a fantastic job of shaking up delicious cocktails, but if you like beer there are plenty of draft options to choose from! they also have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that lasts until 8. definitely check this place out!
they read, they followed and they conquered!i went back to the famous with a lot of expectation and i am <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to say that they did not disappoint! my friend and i started the night with guinness, the dark frothy pint of deliciousness was the start of a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> relaxing night... ...then the specialty craft cocktails started coming! i immensely enjoyed the russian std. mule, it was amazing! i am <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to give them the well deserved five stars a bump up to stardom from my previous review! not only did they follow through with the customer suggestions but they continuously served us with consistent amazing concoctions through out the night!the famous is open mon. to fri. at 5pm-2am. sat &amp; sun at 6pm-2am and of course don't forget the ever so famous <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> that runs from 5 to 8pm monday through friday! i believe it's $2 off spirits &amp; cocktails and $1 off beer &amp; wine. make your <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> an exceptional <span class="highlighted">happy</span> moments! bring your friends and hang-out in their chic and savvy lounge area, enjoy watching a game or classic shows &nbsp;in their sophisticated projection screen! it's pretty swanky i have to say. i will be back again for sure! always remember to drink responsibly! cheers to the famous!
stopped in here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> the other day. they had a great selection of beer and whiskey and their menu offers some very nice cocktail choices. they had some large tvs with the clippers game on mute. it's no sports bar, but you can definitely catch a game there. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal is 2 dollars off everything which isn't bad. you can end up getting a fairly expensive double ipa for 5 dollars on draft. we checked out a food menu and attempted to order. apparently they don't have a traditional kitchen. they have a guy in the back courtyard cooking up some burgers and grilled cheese. it's a separate entity, and you have to pay separately. no big deal, i got a pretty tasty grilled cheese. the bar tenders were pretty friendly and helpful. they catered to my wife's indecisive drink needs and when they found out we were new to the neighborhood they suggested some other local spots we might like. now whenever my wife wants to go shopping in glendale, i have a reason to ride along.
what a welcome alternative to the tavern for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!i went to the famous yesterday for the first time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;we walked in at around 5:00, and there wasn't a soul in there. &nbsp;i did find that a little strange for a thursday during hh, but since our group is used to the tavern which is always obnoxiously packed, this was a pleasant change. their hh is $5 drafts til 8:00 pm - not a knock your socks off deal, but decent. &nbsp;they had a nice draft selection which included racer 5, one of my favorite ipas. &nbsp;the selection is decently sized and definitely manageable. &nbsp;i actually don't like when a place has 500 beers on draft. &nbsp;one of the guys working there graciously put a hockey game on for us that we were wanting to watch as well. &nbsp;the place started to fill up around 7-8:00, but it was never too packed. &nbsp;the service is great - a major step up from the horrid service we get at other hh spots around town. &nbsp;the ambience is cool. &nbsp;we will definitely be back! &nbsp;i just wish they had a kitchen.
the famous has plenty of comfy seating and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day until 8p. i got a cocktail called ivy rose, which was good but a bit too sweet. my boyfriend got an old fashioned (his go-to drink). our bartender was quite helpful and had super generous hands.i am not a whiskey/rye drinker, but i can tell you their duck confit tacos were unexpectedly delicious. you get 3 regular-sized tacos for $8. the tacos had a delicious kick (from sweet thai chili) and wonderful flavour. i would have liked a bit more veggies on top, but my boyfriend and i both enjoyed some fancy tacos with our strong drinks.
on my post lunch walks i've passed this place and always been intrigued by it. we finally came down here one night to say goodbye to our friend who was leaving the next day (she is now a prof at dartmouth, soooo can't feel too bad for her). stepping through here is like going through the looking glass (i would say stepping through the train station at harry potter, but lets keep it classy). i say this because from the outside it looks small and you can't really see much. when you enter it looks narrow but opens up into a spacious dimly lit bar/lounge/dance floor. there are couches/chairs/stools to sit on, and a good size bar. really words can't do this place justice on how weird it is, but weird that works. the drink prices were one of the reasons we almost didn't go here. $12 for a cocktail is a little rich for my blood, and they usually aren't worth it (notice i say usually). we came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> though, so it was $2 off everything (not the best deal in town, but you don't sacrifice quality for what you get). sadly i can't remember the name of the drink i got and it isn't on their online menu. the description said tastes like root beer, kicks like whiskey/bourbon? (yes i know bourbon technically is whiskey).i was sold. the drinks we all got were soooo good. mine really did taste like root beer but i got a nice buzz off of it. why more drinks aren't root beer flavored is beyond me. i feel like this is a can't miss <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if you are in the area. it also had a calendar on the wall of their events. it looks like they do fun activities (trivia, dancing, etc.) most nights. i would come check that out. 52/100
i came here earlier this week after a yelp event because i was told that the famous was offering <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices to everyone wearing a yelp name tag. yay for the famous being so yelper-friendly! located across the street from the americana, the famous is a very nice bar with lovely bartenders and food from vagabond grillyard. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is monday through friday, 5-8pm, with $2 off spirits/cocktails and $1 off beer/wine. because their food is from a separate entity, there is no hh pricing for the burgers.their list of specialty cocktails is good and reasonably priced, and they also will make you whatever concoction you like that's not listed on the menu as well. how accomodating! i got their cherry-lime rickey: russian standard vodka, sour cherry syrup, lime juice, acid phsphate, soda. the description didn't sound so appealing to me, but the bartender recommended it when i told him i have a sweet tooth... and he was right! i really liked it :)i came here with crystal w. and she got their autumn crush: old grand dad bonded bourbon, lemon juice, honey, fresh cranberries. i did not like it (she let me try a sip), but she really liked it, which is probably why she ordered it :p our bartender was really nice; crystal had commented how the drink would pair really well with luxardo cherries... and he actually gave her three of them! they are delicious :) and in addition to being really nice and friendly, our bartender had an awesome mustache ;)definitely a great place to stop by for drinks if you're in the area!
strong drinks. nice space. totally not what i expected from the look of the place from the outside. not a narrow entrance way by any means but it opens up to a much wider space and cavernous bar and lounge area with a small stage all the way to the back. i had a pendleton (canadian whiskey) and 7 (they dont carry seagrams 7) at the suggestion of the barkeep. it was good. i liked it. it was a good pour, i was satisfied... i went there for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with some former coworkers and had a good time. they had ordered some appetizers by the time i got there and i can tell you that the truffle fries and the pizzette-sized personal pizza were both good. actually, the truffle fries were very good.parking can be difficult for the famous if you dont know the area. there's a parking garage behind the glendale marketplace. there are metered parking spaces on the street and in a lot across the side street (harvard)... i valet at the americana but there are other options. don't be discouraged, just drive around looking for a space and you'll find it.oh and restrooms are very clean. that's always a plus.
such a disappointment. this place has so much potential and i truly wanted to like it. i love bars, i love whiskey...how can it go wrong? &nbsp; terrible bar service is how. went in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (which goes till 8:00, so that's a plus one star). we were &quot;greeted&quot; by someone i thought was not a bar tender since they had zero personality, wore a random t-shirt, and seemed bothered to have to give us drink menus. i say &quot;greeted&quot; because i don't think there was any verbal acknowledgment of our arrival to the bar. no customer service etiquette whatsoever. i noticed two other guys behind the bar just talking to each other. bar tenders are supposed to be friendly, inviting, tell you about their specials or popular drinks, and at the very least- say hello. not here. super unfriendly. so if you are looking for a good selection whiskey, go here...but if you want a smile and to feel welcome, don't. that's all.
ok, so i'm finally going to write a review for this place.this is my favorite bar. i hang out here all the time. it has something for everyone.where to start?1. kick ass <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. 5-8 is far better than the early afternoon that i see a lot of other places offer. 5 dollar beer is good until you see just what they have on tap and are offering for 5 bucks, then it becomes insanely good. the beer selection used to be good but limited but since the addition of a bunch of new taps it's now just plain good.2. the cocktail program is fantastic, and while neat can also offer a top notch cocktail experience in glendale the famous offers one that's comparable but with a much more approachable atmosphere that the more casual patron can enjoy.3. the people that work there are all awesome. nice, knowledgeable and good for a laugh if you stop to talk to them but even more importantly they're all good at their jobs, they know what they're talking about and they know how to take care of you if you let them.4. the location. it's right across the street from the americana and it's surrounded by awesome parking options. let's be real here folks this is an awesome bar that actually has good parking that you don't need to pay for. if you're an la native you know how valuable that is.i personally prefer to park in the lot next to the library and bevmo on harvard. it's metered but only costs 50 cents an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> until 10 o'clock, after 10 it's free until the morning. there is also the marketplace garage about a block away on maryland which is free for 90 minutes if you're just trying to grab a quick <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the americana also has a big garage but you'll only get an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> of free parking there without a validation of some kind.5. it's just plain fun. i've seen it packed and i've seen it on slow nights, it's fun either way. when it's quiet you can rely on the fact that it's comfortable and spacious while always having some &nbsp;interesting movie on the projectors. they have live music most tuesdays when i'm there and even on nights when they don't the grand piano in the back is open to anyone that can play.this is your neighborhood dive bar without the dive. i hang out all over la but i always come back to the famous. it's the kind of bar that i wish they had in glendale a long time ago.
i am so <span class="highlighted">happy</span> a place like this that has opened up in glendale. lord knows glendale needs something new and exciting! i never think to hang out or go bar hoping in glendale...ever! well now thing's have changed :)the bar itself is big and spacious...it would be hard for anyone to feel claustrophobic. the decor is great: perfectly dim lights, with brown-themed simple, classy furniture &amp; the awesome touch of exposing the original brick wall of the building makes this place very cozy.i have to come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>; drink prices are a bit pricey ($12) but they are very stiff &amp; the lovely mixology-trained bartenders will take their time to ensure your drink is just right. i had one of the bartenders dump the whole thing out cuz he didn't feel it tasted like it should.we met the owners who were super nice, so i wish them all the best &amp; hope this place gains steam so it can be a success!
a trip here just before any new year's craziness resulted in a chill visit to this whiskey bar. &nbsp;dark woods, cushion-y bar stools for my big butt, and plenty of space to lounge out.fine cocktails and new inventions, i kicked off my visit with the recommended live young die fast cocktail -- a spicy kick-in-your-mouth drink garnished with basil and boozed with gin. &nbsp;i'm no gin drinker, but the drink itself was pretty hot. &nbsp;i've never ventured into savory or spicy drinks, so this was a pretty neat intro.i followed this up the french (bubbly cognac concoction), russian std mule (which was fine - but average) and the namesake famous cocktail, which i enjoyed.they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> i could meet, a few beers on the menu, and the place is new enough that they are currently relying on word-of-mouth advertising.i don't know yet what sort of regular crowd is popping up here, but there were some annoyingly boisterous drunk people on my visit, but they didn't last long.good place for a drink, whether by yourself or a few others.i enjoyed my bartender, who was very meticulous about serving me up good looking beverages that are made with care.
i went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and it was awesome. was not crowded at all. the bartenders were seriously cool dudes. when i open a tab, i usually have to repeat my last name everything i get a drink. they actually remembered me. i got pretty much beers the whole night but i did order one of their cocktails named &quot;the captain.&quot;i think the captain tasted horrible, but i do appreciate that it took some skill and time to make it. lighting up an orange peel? smashing sugar? using aromatics? this drink took a few minutes to make and that honestly, was pretty cool. at one point i was like &quot; oh cool, he's done.&quot; nope. let me mesmerize you with more witchcraft.  it was a nice setting where me and my friends could enjoy a drink and there was a movie playing on the projector. the restrooms had pictures of pinups instead of the usual ....nothing? &nbsp;dim lighting but that's whatever, we were there when the sun was still out. &nbsp;a few times the music that was playing felt really downer, but one of the guys changed it right away to keep the mood up.
stopped in for the first time on tuesday, then returned again the very next night... their old fashioned skills are that good. &nbsp;on tuesday, i was solo, and completely sober upon arrival. &nbsp;i missed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ($2.00 off most drinks) by 2 minutes, but did not care once i tasted my drink. &nbsp;david, as well as every other bartender in the place, makes old fashioneds just the way i like them. &nbsp;you will not find any cherries in your old fashioneds here. &nbsp;picture seven grand as opposed to cpk. &nbsp;i only had time for one drink tuesday, but on wednesday, a bit more. &nbsp;i returned for a friend's bday with a party of 6. &nbsp;ironically, none of them had even ever heard of &quot;the famous&quot; before. &nbsp;if the famous isn't by now, it definitely should be. &nbsp;everyone in my party agreed that the drinks and vibe there were excellent. in just two quick visits, they have already jumped into my top 3 places to grab a drink in la. &nbsp;as bill m. so eloquently put it in his review - the journeyman ravenswood rye whiskey is perfect for an old fashioned. &nbsp;i will be sure to get &quot;stache's&quot; name when i return, and give him the proper acknowledgment for his perfect drink suggestion. &nbsp;and at only $13.00 a pop ($11.00 if ordered on its own, $2.00 to make it an old fashioned), i see no reason to ever drive down the wallet busting whistlepig highway again.overall i went with 4 stars because i still have to try them out on a busier night, when the food trucks i've heard about make their appearance. &nbsp;after i have tried all that the famous has to offer, i will update my review/rating accordingly. &nbsp;until then, i highly recommend the famous for all non-cpk style old fashioned fans.
been waiting for a place like this to open in this area for a very long time. &nbsp;i hope and pray that they stick around. &nbsp;i like the ambiance and they do make a great drink and have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. &nbsp;all this will stay. &nbsp;a few things they should improve on if they want to stick around. &nbsp;get the food menu straight. &nbsp;i know they are just starting out but not having truffle fries or getting 3 instead of 4 pieces on an app all lead to confusion and a subpar experience. &nbsp;just keep the menu simple and get it right and make sure the food is tasty. &nbsp; if you are going to have a speak easy type of a bar, it would be great if the bartenders looked a little more stylish. &nbsp;class it up a little. &nbsp;maybe have 1 drink special all night so the beer drinking customers might actually give the drinks are try and not feel bad instead of spending $12. &nbsp;over all i love it, but i worry this bar might not be in the right neighborhood. i will tell everyone i know to go there but i hope they keep up their end but providing excellent service as well. &nbsp;good luck famous...i am rooting for you!!

came with a few work friends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> last week and it impressed me enough to recommend it again for this week's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.clean, spacious, and with great ambience, this place delivers a great selection of food and drinks. the music is a bit loud, but the rest makes up for it.we've powered down the potato skins, sliders, all the fries, etc. tangerine beer is delicious, and when they ran out they gave us our choice at the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price.the owner came by and graciously offered us bread pudding and beer root beer (which is redonkulous) at the end of our meal.we had a blast, leaving with full stomachs and <span class="highlighted">happy</span> memories. this will be a fixture in our <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cycle for a long time.
my poodle pal and i love this place! the staff is great and the food is excellent. &nbsp;we went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with a few friends, another pup, and had a great time. the poodle had chicken and rice which came out on the fancy tray with doggie biscuits as a side. &nbsp;we ended up packing the treats to go as the dish was filling enough. the adults went with wings, sliders, skins, and nachos... all from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, all delicious. washed all that down with morrison mules (i made mine an kentucky) ... also on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. only wish there was a little more patio space for the pups, but overall it's a great place! we will be back soon.
the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. great dinner. lots of fun drinks. bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable. the atmosphere was great . i love it here.
awesome whiskey. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;and the most delicious desert, bread pudding with a whiskey carmel sauce! so good.

this place has the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in town and the bread pudding is so delicious. we had the wonderful opportunity to meet mark, who is one of the owners and he gave us a bread pudding on the house and extended <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for us. what more can you ask for. if you haven't been here you need to visit soon especially on friday. it's packed but the environment is positive and chill.
we had an amazing time at the morrison last night. a group of friends from work went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i got the bee's butt from their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cocktail menu (only $6!). then mark, the owner, surprised us with a sampler of their desserts, including their award winning bread pudding! i would definitely go again, i see this becoming our regular <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> haunt.
this is my favorite place to come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work with the coworkers! the brussels sprouts are out of this world and we end up going through about 3 dishes of them! the service is also top notch, everyone takes great care of us and they really go out of their way on birthdays. highly recommend for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
love this place. we &nbsp;come here for our horror <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> and the management is just awesome. they occasionally hook us up with free desserts. see pic!
first time here and the food is amazing! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals and menu! phenomenal service and atmosphere! highly recommended!
your bread pudding rocks! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is great. and thanks for making our birthday girl feel extra special. we'll be back soon!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review - 4.5 stars <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is daily from 3-7pm throughout the entire restaurant and bar areas. they have select cocktails and draft beer for $5. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food menu is fairly extensive and features a variety of appetizers for $5 each. bar staff is very friendly and accommodating. the cocktails are made well and are strong. the nachos were sizable for the price, but there was way too much sour cream poured over the top and the chips were swimming in cheese sauce at the bottom of the bowl. it was an average dish. in addition to the food items on the hh menu, they also offer a gigantic soft pretzel for $5 that is served with ranch, mustard, and maple honey dressings. this is a great place to go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks. prices are fantastic and service is very good. if the food was better, it would be 5 stars.parking - small, free lot or 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of free street parking
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at the morrison (3-7 pm daily) yields some great deals. i particularly enjoyed the nachos, potato skins, and the crispy brussels sprouts. the bread pudding for dessert was delicious as well, especially with the caramel sauce which i could eat with a spoon (and did just that with the leftovers). we got to sample the root beer that was actually beer, and it tasted exactly like root beer (dangerous)!we received great service for our group and will consider the morrison for future <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>.
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, excellent service, and amazing bread pudding. don't come here because i want to keep this place a secret.
went here with my brother during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> lunch and dominated the food. everything was delicous including the large draft selection.
we are coming here every <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> love the food but i must say the bread pudding is the best, wow amazing. our waiter was super nice!
really good food and drinks. fantastic for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on saturdays. super dog friendly. wait staff is awesome. we met one of the owners who was great.
i really love this place. food here is amazing. the staff is very kind and helpful. can't beat their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. burgers are juicy and perfectly cooked
great atmosphere, great food, great service! you cant't beat the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals and the bread pudding is to die for!

best place to hang out and have great food and drinks!!!!haven't been here for <span class="highlighted">happyhour</span> yet but i hear the food is amazing also...must try the burgers and the beer selection is endless...
we went on a friday afternoon for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i got there later than my coworkers. &nbsp;they said the service was a little spotty during the shift change, but by the time i was there it was fine. &nbsp;i had the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sliders, they were good. &nbsp;the owner came by to talk to us and since we were new to the place he gave us seven desserts to try. &nbsp;the bread pudding was particularly good as was the frozen desserts.
i would give this place 5 stars on service alone. owner was super nice and greeted each table individually. they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday that includes really yummy appetizers.must try bread pudding!
i must say this place has the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and desserts to die for!!! i loved their bread pudding. no wonder it was voted #1!!
came here based on the reviews and was not disappointed! &nbsp;great atmosphere for the game and great food and beer selection!! &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a must. &nbsp;mark the owner even came by to check on our table. &nbsp;service and food tops!
tried this place for the first time today for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, yes on a sunday! &nbsp;the food was very good, the prices reasonable for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the ambiance was happening and the location is great. &nbsp;there had been many restaurants on this spot before that failed, so i'm <span class="highlighted">happy</span> an establishment like the morrison has finally moved in here and has made it work. &nbsp;i will be coming back. &nbsp;this place is already a favorite after one try!

great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;their old fashioned was great and the sliders were perfect . we had an alcoholic root beer that was dangerously delicious . and of course their bread pudding was out of this world.
came here last friday during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. food: seasoned well and the portions worth your money (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> appetizers + daily special steak)- the manager also came by to give us a taste of their beer that tasted like rootbeer! yum!- received complimentary bread pudding, and it was delicious! it's extremely sweet so be ready to chug water (or alcohol).staff: attentive even when called for left and right. parking: small lot, but it's alright if you come at a good time.
this place is the tits, awesome bartenders and great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and whiskey. ben was great and made our night.the sliders, yes.the wings, yes.the cheese fries, sort of a maybe for me.but what a great place.
this place is the bomb-diggity! nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. bread pudding was also very good.
a great nicer-than-a-pub pub. everything here is good, but the atmosphere, service, and owner are truly excellent. the bread pudding is indeed probably the best in la. fun from <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> through late. &quot;if i could give it six stars, i would&quot; -my girlfriend's dad
the morrison! the best service i've had at a restaurant since i can remember. fantastic beers (try the root beer beer) and a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! also, it's the best bread pudding i've ever had- so. good.

seriously amazing customer service!!!! the manager, kim, was especially sweet and the food and drinks were great! i went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to celebrate my birthday with some friends and it was an excellent choice! they went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of and even gave me a birthday balloon and complimentary bread pudding- which was delicious!!! we also had the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> nachos, cheese fries and sliders, all of which were delicious and well priced! i highly recommend checking this place out! :)
this is a great standard gastropub. we went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and got some $6 appetizers and cocktails. the morrison mule and bees butt cocktails are very good and not too sweet. the wings and kale caesar are very good. the nachos are okay-nothing to write home about.

the morrison is the shiznit. &nbsp;seriously tho, what a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and selection of bourbon. &nbsp;the owner mark recommend a couple japanese whiskies that were awesome which were yamazaki 12 and hibiki 17. &nbsp;great place!
delicious food, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and amazing hospitality from the staff and owner. the chili dog and bread pudding were favs at our table as were the brussels sprouts. we'll be back again!
omg this place is to dieeeeee for, amazing drinks, food and service!!! their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is unti 7:00 pm which is awesome.parking is a bit busy, but it's worth it love this place!
love the morrison.. great food excellent service and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great..way beyond dog friendly, that treat your pooch like a family member.. dog biscuits, own water bowl, doggy menu, and served on a silver platter...
totally worth the visit. filet burger was orgasmic. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals ordered like 4 moscow mules because they were such a deal. and the bread pudding!!!!!! omg!!!! some of the best ever. and the owner was kind enough to bring it out on the house because it was first time there! thank you wonderful man.
excellent service here. came in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and enjoyed their cocktail selection and sampled some apps. the most memorable appetizer we had was the brussels sprouts! it was a giant portion and they had balsamic and hazelnuts on them! our server gave us a few sauces to try out and we ended up loving how they tasted with the hot sauce. overall, an enjoyable <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> experience.
was in from out of town and stopped in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and a little dinner- everything was amazing and the service was great! i will come back for sure next time i'm in cali! the deserts were amazingggg by the way!
our second time and it was just as amazing as our first experience! such a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>... this may be one of the few places that offers $6 craft cocktails. not to mention the staff is so friendly! if you have room after the large food portions (also on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>) you have to try the bread pudding! it tastes like heaven in your mouth. will be back again soon for sure!
if you're looking for some good old fashioned comfort food in a chill environment this is your spot. the food and the service are great. it's next to impossible to find good food for under ten bucks in los angeles, but <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here fits the bill. &nbsp;oh and don't forget the bread pudding...it's amazing!
incredible burger stop, bourbanator burger was next level with a balanced bacon and blue cheese on croissant-like bun. great craft beer selection that had several taps i'd never heard of before. bar staff is chatty and welcoming without overdoing it. owner on site for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. no better experience for a burger-beer-<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in los feliz.
it's been 10 months and 10 months worth of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> shenanigans. nothing has altered my opinion of the lala land self-absorbed locals. but ....it's my involuntary actions that continue to drive me to this infamous parking lot and park my lot at the bar (sometimes a table) <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> saves me significant amounts of $$$ during specified <span class="highlighted">hours</span> so at the end of the night, my expensive tab could be worse. not that i'm an alcoholic, we refer to it as a &quot;professional&quot;. mind you, my taste buds remain rather intact and being the foodie that i am, there is absolutely nothing on the menu that won't satisfy your cravings. service is even better than ever!
nice staff, great food &amp; great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> choices! (3-7pm) &nbsp;split the bacon bourbonator and fries &nbsp;with a friend (big portions). owner recommended the 'not your father's root beer' with their amazingggggg bread pudding
i have been here twice. once on a saturday and it was pretty empty and then on a thursday during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and there twice as many people.the morrison is worth it during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. all beers and well drinks are $5 and they have a small but good variety of food specials. best thing to order for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is definitely the burger or fish and chips.i would not come here during regular <span class="highlighted">hours</span> again because i feel that the beer and food is overpriced.
love this place!!! the service is some of the best i've had anywhere in la. the bacon bourbonator burger was really good and the bread pudding was amazing!! also had the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> mac n cheese which was pretty good.
i went for the first time a couple days ago and i'm definitely going back. the food and the atmosphere were great and everyone made us feel welcome. the owner was really nice and took care of us. i'd definitely recommend this place. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day saturday and sunday makes it even better.
loved this place! their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials are awesome, great selections and great ambiance;) the owner, mark is such a friendly guy- he goes around asking everyone if they need anything and just makes you feel so welcome! the staff is all really nice and their bread pudding dessert is amaaaaazing!! will definitely come back!!
mmm... &nbsp;bread pudding was amazing! &nbsp;very attentive staff and management. &nbsp;parking was a bit tight, but we found a spot as someone pulled out. &nbsp;great energy during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
great hospitality and amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that will keep you from 3-7pm....and they are so accommodating for large parties and dogs. mark was very thoughtful and helped us celebrate a birthday with balloons and bread pudding. our waiters have always been attentive and plenty of parking the area.
place is bomb!... tried everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. sliders, wings and the tater skins.... all good in da hood!.... our bartenders meghan &amp; ily so chill!...
the-glendale-tap-glendale
my bad! this place is awesome. incredible beer selection, friendly people and the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
huge rotating tap selection, free pool, free peanuts, and weekly <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 8pm. yes, it does get crowded on the weekends but i hardly if ever visit this place on the weekends since this is my go to spot on the way home from work. if you're in the area during the weekdays and need a quick pick me up with some good craft beer, this is your spot!<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - $2.00 off all drinks
great beer selection, free pool, free peanuts, great service. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 5pm to 7pm. great diverse crowd who are super sociable and friendly.
i live not too far from the gt and i have given it the title of &quot;my bar.&quot; love the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the crazy variety of great brews. is it a fancy bar full of hipsters? nope. that's how i like it. throw in a couple more tvs for football games and it would be heaven on earth.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review.their <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> are a bit strange but have been confirmed by one of the bartenders. this information is not available on the website: mon, tues, wed: 5-8pmthurs: 1-8pmfri: 5-7pmsat/sun: 1-5pmduring the above <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, all pints are $2 off and all goblets are $1 off.this is probably the best dive bar for brews that i've found. there is nothing fancy about this place. it's dark and has a bit of a retro feel upon entering. there are bar stools along the bar and a few tables scattered throughout. bartenders are nice, helpful, and knowledgeable.there are many draft beers on tap and a nice variety of ales. i'm told that they rotate several taps about every 3 wks. it feels like a neighborhood joint where everyone knows each other. they don't serve food per se, but they do sell pretzels for $3 and serve free peanuts. they have one pool table and, remarkably, they offer free pool every day, all day.parking - free street parking
great local bar, very reasonably priced, wide selection of beer on tap, nitro and bottles. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> can't be beat. &nbsp;not a place for food - just straight drinking.
best craft beer bar in the area with over 50 taps, many rotating, and more to come. relaxed atmosphere, great prices and unbeatable $4 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pints!
i do not have any complaints about this place since the first time a tried it. &nbsp;if you love craft beer then you have come to the right place. &nbsp;they have on tap most local craft beer. mix that with free pool, peanuts and great bartenders and you have a cool place to chill out during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i normally come here after work before my music classes on tuesdays. &nbsp;they open at 5 pm. &nbsp;it starts getting crowded around 7pm on tuesdays. &nbsp;don't know about the weekends. &nbsp;beer prices during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are $4. &nbsp;their empanadas are $4 or 3 for $10. &nbsp;pretty reasonable. &nbsp;if you decide to come here, salud!
this place is just the *worst* so please don't come here - leave it all to me. leave me the 50+ beers on tap, the kind bartenders with their impressive knowledge about all of the delicious brews, the fine juke box and the two free pool tables. leave me the perfect ambiance and chill vibes, the criminally cheap <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals and the good natured patrons. if you come here, i will not share my free peanuts with you.
this is my favorite craft beer pub in la. i love tony's, sunset beer co, mohawk bend, etc, but yeah, for me this is the best deal. no attitude, 52 taps, great beer selection, always rotating. steve, the owner, is very helpful, calm and friendly. bartenders are always very friendly too, which is awesome, considering the clientele is very random here... i mean from hard-core craft beer enthusiasts to just legal young guys asking for pbr. the place can get really busy at night, for me the best time to go is for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which is from opening to 6.30 every week day.
great craft beer bar. excellent selection of rotating reasonably priced craft beers and has a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 5 to 8 m-w 1 to 8 on thus and 1-5 sat-sun with $2 off all the beers. the bartenders are very knowledgeable as well as the owner steve knows his beers and is a great guy. they are expanding soon and will be brewing their own beers. can you say growlers. keep up the extraordinary job.
great bar!! &nbsp;good diverse selection of craft beer on tap. &nbsp;usually a few selections of ciders on tap for the gluten free folks. &nbsp;super nice bartenders &amp; owner. &nbsp;free pool &amp; peanuts! &nbsp;empanadas &amp; preztels from local vendors. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 5-7
another great beer bar within biking distance! &nbsp;yay!a very large (something like 50) variety of beer on tap. &nbsp;bartenders are friendly, knowledgeable and <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to let you sample before you commit. &nbsp;they can also point you to new and interesting beers to try if you can tell them what you like and don't like.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> has good deals as well. &nbsp;i think its $5 pints from 4-7 pm.
i don't get some of these reviews about the blond bartender. she is, by far, the friendliest one here. she greets us by our names (because she actually took the time to learn them) and is very attentive. the beer selection is awesome, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are the best in the area. this is dive bar done right. not to mention awesome jukebox and free pool and peanuts. all the right check marks checked off.
quite possibly one of the best kept secrets around. &nbsp;super cheap <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beers...i seriously thought there was a mistake on the tab. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;amazing beers - my mind was blown. &nbsp;i tasted a coffee chocolate beer...yes please. &nbsp;cute bathrooms, peanuts, nice bartenders, free pool - what else do ya need?
we heard about this place from the bartender at the eagle rock brewery. there wasn't much to do around it but this dive bar was full of character. they had a variety of beers/ciders. i tried the manifesto which is brewed down the street and it was $4 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the manager/owner was beyond friendly and even let us bring tacos from across the street to munch on while we had our delicious beer. i definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a relaxing spot and a good beer. street parking was also easy to find.
a hidden gem for sure! i found this place by accident while driving on san fernando. &nbsp;it has a very hipster before hipster's became cool vibe to it. it's where all the real hipsters come to get away from the typical la gastropubs. the floor is decorated with peanut shells and the air is filled with mellow chatter and great music. the bartenders all look like lumberjacks which is freakin rad! (i'm a sucker for beards and flannel) they are very knowledgeable and will let you sample some beers if you're unsure what you want to order. they have a huge selection of brews! they do have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, although i forget the times. parking can be a little hard to find. i think it's only street parking.
respect the craft!wow! this place is incredible!50 plus beers on tap. great bottle selection too. you will not find a budweiser or coors light here...maybe a pabst, because the hipsters think its good. we are talking all of the up and coming la and sd breweries. alpine, absolution, ballast point, ect.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are unreal in any town, but in la?i believe it is a converted auto repair shop(?) very cool ambience. very chill.free pool, free peanuts, free wi-fibartenders are incredibly nice and unpretentious. dan is the man! brain is a certificated cicerone and the three others are cool too. very knowledgeable about craft beer and are willing to chat you up if you wish...or not. ask for the beer list clipboard and good luck finding any less than five beers in the style you want. your choices will be great!!you can't go wrong at the glendale tap, maybe one of the top three craft beer bars in la
&quot;there's a lion and a giraffe. they're like hanging out. there friends.&quot;this rather unconventionally structured joke was my first introduction to a rather great bar. &nbsp;probably should have led with the termite joke. &nbsp;a little bit of a hidden gem, the glendale tap is a great bar -- filled to the brim with tchotchkes, taps and pool tables, homey without feeling artificial. &nbsp;the genuinely friendly (occasionally quirky) staff, almost driven to dirty dishes will let you try what seems like everything (and it is appreciated). &nbsp;no word yet on whether you could actually try all 52 taps. &nbsp;plus! beer here is pretty cheap, going for $6 up to 9 and down a couple of bucks for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (which runs for two <span class="highlighted">hours</span> after 5. &nbsp;not <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with just dirtying glasses, they have peanuts you can eat and encourage to throw on the floor with wild abandon. &nbsp;&quot;you here for awhile?&quot; &quot;why do you ask?&quot; &quot;you picked the twenty minute long song...&quot;a little worried about the digital jukebox in the corner, they've made sure to limit it to songs you should be listening to -- jazzy numbers and the like. &nbsp;there were also some christmas songs mixed in for some mood music for some writing regulars. &nbsp;&quot;my brother plays the flugelhorn.&quot; did i mention there was a good crowd?
you know those tv shows/movies where there's a bunch of twenty somethings and they all convene at a cool low key spot to shoot the shit, play pool, and drink beer once a week? this is that spot.i almost didn't want to write a review on this place because it's such a great gem, i don't want other people to know about it! &nbsp;come with your crew, order a beer you've never tried before, grab some peanuts and throw the shells on the floor, play some pool, and pick some sweet tunes from the jukebox. &nbsp;it's got a worn-in, small town feel. &nbsp;nothing pretentious about this place. &nbsp;it reminds me of a bar my parents would have hit up when they were my age. &nbsp; &nbsp;i'm not really a beer expert, so the bartender made a lot of educated suggestions for me to try. &nbsp;i had a pear cider, an ipa, and some locally brewed beer, all for less than 15 bucks during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;i definitely recommend the ciders if you're not into strong beers. &nbsp;they're sweet, flavorful, with just a hint of alcohol. &nbsp;normally, i feel weird going out with my sober friends, but not to glendale tap. &nbsp;even if you're not drinking, you can still have fun here.
terrible service. wont be back. came in with a friend and were definitely made to feel unwanted by the bartender. not sure what it was about since he was being nice to the other people in the place. best guess is that the only visible difference between my friend and i and the rest of the patrons is that we were the only non-white people in the place. besides being rude, he did amateurish, foolish things. first off he didn't know when their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is. secondly if you ask him to taste a beer, he acts annoyed. then if he gives you a taste of something and you don't like it, he gets really annoyed. &nbsp;then he proceeds to pour you the beer you finally order in the glass he gave you a taste in. so if you tasted a hoppy ipa and left a gulp at the bottom but then end up ordering a bock, he just pours the bock on top of the ipa. a place that boasts about its 52 taps should have more respect for its beers and its customers.this place is a dump don't waste your time.
glendale tap rules, other beer bars drools. &nbsp;let me tell you a story: i went here one early evening with a pal to yap about work and whatever, and we bellied up to the bar. &nbsp;we were informed that it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which meant $2 off every pint. &nbsp;i requested a basket of peanuts, because nothing is more awesome than eating dry roasted peanuts while you drink cold beer, listen to rock music, and throw the gd shells right on the gd floor. &nbsp;then, after being informed of the crazy special barrel of craftsman whathaveyou that they were featuring off-menu, and after perusing the list of the 50+ craft beers on tap, i picked the best one: &nbsp;a nitrogen-poured pint of miller high life. &nbsp;&quot;nitrogen pour&quot; is how, say, guinness is served. &nbsp;where most beers are forced out of the keg via carbon dioxide, this was not. &nbsp;it's rare to see it with non-stouts/porters, and rarer still to see it used as an alternative way to enjoy a beer you're familiar with as a co2. &nbsp;and i had certainly never seen that before with the &quot;king of the uncle beers,&quot; miller high life (my personal favorite of the cheapos, so i knew i was already in the right place if they had this as the only &quot;major brew&quot; on tap).the feeling? &nbsp;well, as i described it to my pal tim, as we sat at the bar shelling peanuts: &quot;if the back of this bar rolled up, and we found ourselves magically transported to the upper deck at dodger stadium, this would be the best day of my life.&quot;and not just because it meant we had discovered that magic was real. &nbsp;but because this nitrogen poured high life tasted like a beer slushy, without the slush. &nbsp;it was cold, and smooth, and the most perfect thing i could imagine to go with baseball, which i don't really care that much about. &nbsp;but it rules with beer and being outside in the sun. &nbsp;the cost to me for this mini-vacation? $3.00 usd. &nbsp;i followed it up with the craftsman, which was an ipa that was fermented w/o hops (they were added later to a red ale, i believe). &nbsp;i drank it, and said, &quot;this tastes like ipa tea.&quot; to which the bartendress added, &quot;it basically is. &nbsp;the fresh hops are in there in tea bags.&quot; and it wasn't carbonated at all, just tapped, and poured out of the barrel. &nbsp;man. &nbsp;it was tays-tea. &nbsp;i got drunk on that, and went across the street to eat tacos. &nbsp;the end?
(drank 04/11/13 th @ 10pm): i proudly tapped this watering hole!after a wonderful yelp elite event at the nearby icis apartment homes, several of us weren't ready for the evening to end so we hauled our arses to the glendale tap located on the border with los feliz for some after-event libations...as if we didn't get enough already!i had just dropped off my +1 from the elite yelp event and was already feeling pretty good with the amount of alcohol content in my body, but when fellow yelper schel h. and aren a. said they were going to hit it up, that sounded like a party to me. laura s. also attended along with others.we found ourselves at the very far end of the bar past the pool tables and next to the restrooms. you ordered at the bar to get your choice of libation, of which they apparently had 52 taps <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jvt2inwc8giq6sh2ug9vw">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a> of lovely liquid elixirs from your standard brews to a multitude of craft and microbrews. they also had some in bottles, but when you have that many taps why grab a bottle with you can get it fresher!? throughout the night i ended-up with two microbrews which totally escaped me now ($6.00 ea.), but they were ice cold, refreshing, and hit the spot. and the company i was with made them even that much better! oh, and i can't forget to mention the complimentary bowls of peanuts which helped to soak up any alcohol. we just cracked them open, dumped the shells on the floor, and once the bowl was empty we went to the bar and asked for me. that's how it's done! the service was good from the time they checked my id at the entrance to the two bartenders (the woman had a cuteness about her). you ordered at the bar, they served you, and that was it. there was one person who walked around and collected any empty glasses. very easy-peasy.parking was no bueno since they didn't have their own and it was all on the street (metered until 8pm), either along the main strip of san fernando rd. or the surrounding streets (where i parked). it's a bit industrial and kind of sketchy at nighttime, so be warned.overall, the glendale tap was a nice place to escape, grab a drink or two, and hang with a bit more of a biker-ish crowd if not a grungier clientele on the outskirts of the emerald city. i found good value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (total bill was around $15.00; tip included), but it would've been so much better if they had late-night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the atmosphere, d&eacute;cor, and ambience was pretty divey, dark, rustic, and a handful of tables and chairs all along the wall. the walls were covered with an assortment of old license plates, posters, and other oddball marketing or otherwise material. it kind of reminded me of the crap that was pulled out of the bowels of one of the sharks in the movie &quot;jaws&quot;. there were two free pool tables that took up the majority of the space in the center of this two-car garage-sized building. they also had a food case that displayed empanadas and other simple treats. and i saw two tvs, a jukebox, and there was a songlist machine where we were at for your auditory entertainment. the tunes were pumping with 70's and 80's rock. the attire was totally casual so i would normally be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops. and they accepted my credit card of choice...amex!
i wanted to hate this place before i stepped foot inside. there was a dude with a handlebar mustache and a crew of other nondescript twenty-something hipsters wearing acid-washed jean shorts and oversized cropped band tees. i had already decided i'd stay for thirty minutes, wish my buddy a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> birthday and take off... but i fell a little in love instead. peanut shells on the floor, free pool, a killer digital jukebox, tons of beer selections, even non alcoholic bitburger beer, root beer, and ginger beer for people such as myself who spend sober <span class="highlighted">hours</span> in bars watching everyone get wasted. they also happen to have an owner from chicago, and the bar itself is made from a portion of a bowling lane from miami bowl on the southside, where my husband used to bowl as a kid! pretty sweet, and it's one of the few bars in my neighborhood too. i have to admit, even the hipsters i met were pretty damn cool. i've been back since, and i'm sure i'll be back many, many more times.
the-griffin-los-angeles
<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> till 7pm i believe. &nbsp;buffalo wings, tater tots ... for $5 eachruben sandwich was delicious!
good food and a good vibe whether i'm outside or by the fire! the food is good and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great! love the decor of the place!!!
i love the fire place. nice and toasty. food is quite good too. check out the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 5-7pm!
the griffin rules. &nbsp;dark as fuck. &nbsp;great juke box. &nbsp;great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;olympia in a can. &nbsp;yes, please.
love love love! had a great time at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.... &nbsp;and the cozy seating around the lovely fireplaces are perfect. drinks were amazing, and the pretty much ideal <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu ( not enough veggie options...) were a nice match. will be back often.
great place to come for a quick mix drink/ beer. quick service. diverse crowd. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 5-7pm. we will definitely be coming back.
i came to the griffin for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a friday a couple of weeks ago, and i must say, that this is a great place to unwind, and re-wind as the night goes on. &nbsp;the bartender, jenna was very cool, and can make a pretty stiff drink. &nbsp;most <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, the drinks taste like liquor-flavored ice. &nbsp;as the night went on the place got packed, but in a good way. &nbsp;i must say the griffin is a good place to hang out at, and i shall be a return customer. &nbsp;most likely next friday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. =p
this has one of the best <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> in la. and it's 7 days a week! (five dollars for a beer and basket of wings!)ambiance is great, always ample seating (unless it's after 10), the drinks are strong, the food is delicious!it will start getting crowded after 9. but my friends and i usually just hit up the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and peace out before &quot;the cool kids&quot; get there. :p
we went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on monday and this is a really cool bar. &nbsp;there are a few booths with fireplaces in the middle. &nbsp;there really aren't specials for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but we still had a few drinks and food. &nbsp;i had the garden burger with tater tots. &nbsp;the tater tots were awesome! &nbsp;crispy on the outside with a soft middle. &nbsp;i don't like when the tots are too soggy. &nbsp;these were perfect. i will visit this place again for sure!
meh, i wasn't obsessed. the inside does look like the gryffindor common room though, so that's always nice. &nbsp;the vibes are more relaxing than anything, so this would be a great place to come and grab a drink and have a conversation. &nbsp;i'll probably do just that and come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because they seemed to have a pretty decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;they also have strawberry fruli on tap and you never see that anywhere, so that's really exciting. &nbsp;though it's also $11 per glass........and that's not exciting at all :(
great prices, location, and atmosphere. prices are good, especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. service is usually good, but we recently went on an early friday night and dealt with an extremely rude bartender. not the best experience, and we hope that it was an anomaly.
we were in the neighborhood for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so we decided to try this bar. &nbsp;it was surprisingly very nice inside...soothing ambiance with fire pits and cozy seatings. &nbsp;the architectural design with a brick ceiling and interior decor were amazing.it wasn't crowded on a thursday night which we preferred. &nbsp;we had to move to the bar for faster service:( &nbsp;the drinks &amp; food were good.
love this place! - great late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (friday &amp; saturdays 12am-1am)- jukebox (.50/play) - cozy yet spacious .. and for you &quot;new girl&quot; fans out there.. you might recognize the exterior of the griffin as this is what they show when they cut to nick at work.
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great and the bartenders are nice as well. the outside seating fills up quick though so be ready for that. the inside is more cozy anyway if you ask me which is why you're reading this review right?the tables are big enough for a small group and you can pull others in if you have a large group. the main downside is that drinks can be a bit on the pricey end, but they have a lot of specials that exist outside of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so it's not too bad. they have a very high card minimum (10 on weekdays, 20 on weekends i think), but don't seem to always enforce it.
i give this place a 3.5 since they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but i wouldn't rave about the food. i work near here, so one of my co-workers asked us to come out for some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!the place is nice, it's really dark inside, but you can also sit outside in an enclosed area, anyways the drinks are really strong...guess that's a good thing!the food we ordered were some tater tots (1) which was on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, just bar food, they were okay, really dry.what i did like though and give about 3.5/4 stars too is one of their grilled sandwiches, it was all veggie maybe with bacon i'm not sure, but it also came with an over-easy egg. it was different which is why i think i enjoyed it as much as i did!also got the baked mac-n-cheese (with truffle?) (2.5) it was really mushy and came with broccoli which was kind of weird. and a side of cornbread that was good!anyways i would come again just to hang out and catch a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> maybe, but wouldn't go out of my way!
honestly wasn't terribly impressed with this place. the ambiance, interior architecture, fireplaces are definitely cool. but that's about it. limited beer selection, slow bartenders, $10 minimum, overpriced food - after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, anyway; the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are about as much as i'd want to pay for these lackluster options. i'd probably go here again if someone invited me, but not before trying to convince them to go somewhere else.
i found this place on yelp since it's the game haus cafe. &nbsp;parking can be tough since it's all metered or street parking (free neighborhood street parking if you are willing to walk a couple blocks). &nbsp;we arrived at 6:30pm on a saturday evening and they had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 7pm! &nbsp;woohoo! &nbsp;yay for places that have <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> seven days a week! &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu had $5 appetizer items, beer, wine, and well drinks. &nbsp;we ordered the chicken wings and olympia beer combo (only $5!), the frickles (really yummy! &nbsp;i suggest getting the regular size order for $3 more rather than the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu small order) the mini burger, and tots. &nbsp;i also ordered the $10 fried chicken sandwich, which was pretty large and came with homemade chips. &nbsp;i got to try the grapefruit beer and the strawberry beer (grapefruit was better - the strawberry was too sweet and tasted more like a cider). &nbsp;service could've been better - we had to go to the bar to order every single time, and the bartenders weren't all that friendly. &nbsp;overall, i liked the ambiance and beer selection, and best of all, the frickles! &nbsp;i would come back here just for those!
stone walls, dark interior, two live fire places, candle lit chandeliers, some hanging wall drapery, and a barred outdoor patio. tell me that doesnt sound like the perfect atmosphere to enjoy food or drinks while you socialize and listen to some jams. its a bit medieval i would say but we enjoyed the ambience harbored at the griffin.as for the food, maybe it didn't meet the standard set by the place itself, but you could say it's slightly better than average. i say that based on the griffin burger and my girlfriend's buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. chances are there may well be better things on the menu. i would absolutely return for the vibe and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i saw the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials and immediately wished i could have made it earlier. i also have to mention how good the drinks are; they pour big. hope to make it back soon.
great place. cheap strong drinks especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the bartenders are so sweet and the doorman is very nice too. i think i might have found my new hangout when i go out on weekdays.
got here early on a sat. and was able to get the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals rollin' for my little party of 9! got a great place to sit by the fireplace and enjoyed! no complaints here from me other than my friend ordered when it was super busy and it did take a long time to get their meal. the jukebox was working but when it got pretty crowded past 10:30pm you could barely hear it. we bounced and went to bigfoot when it got too cray-cray. morrison is also close by as well.

i can't believe there are over 400 reviews for this place, and yet, when i was here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (midweek), there were about three customers!i was really pleasantly surprised by my experience here. &nbsp;the space is much bigger than i expected because the reviews here usually mention how small the place is (maybe it looked bigger because there was not a crush of people?) - the main room is pretty big - two fireplaces and a couple alcoves with a bunch of tables - and there is also a nice patio with another fireplace and some lovely, comfortable built-in leather benches along the walls. &nbsp;i was not a fan of the heavy velvet (?) red curtains in every doorway, though. &nbsp;also, i was sadly expecting the space to be more kitschy. &nbsp;oh, well, you can't have everything. &nbsp;finally, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are really good! &nbsp;i got a nice ipa (draught) for $3.this is a nice, chill place to hang out with friends.
the food here is amazing! &nbsp;i guess we came for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but still ended up ordering non hh items. &nbsp;it was a monday afternoon, so there wasn't much of a crowd...basically just us and 3 other ppl. &nbsp;everything we ate was delish and really really filling:oxtail poutineblt with fried egg and tater totsfricklescurry hot wingsi would recommend the griffin! &nbsp;parking was a cinch, the bartenders were awesome, and the food was bomb. &nbsp;really cool atmosphere with a chill vibe to it. sidenote: you might recognize the outside as the bar from new girl, which is always cool!
tots!!best tots and spicy ketchup ever.i had them with the house salad and it was a perfect lunch.the boy had a burger and was super <span class="highlighted">happy</span>.we came on a sunday afternoon and it was pretty dead around 3:30 but the closer it got to the 5 pm <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, the more it filled up.cool place with fireplaces and a medieval feel. &nbsp;service from the bartender was good and quick!i would def come back here on a cold day...love those fireplaces.
any night at the griffin is a night well spent. you can always count on this place for a relaxing atmosphere and good drinks. the parking is either plentiful or hell, &nbsp;but nothing compared to hollywood. haven't tried their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu but most of their drinks run from $9-12. the bar itself is pretty dark, with a nice fireplace and candles around the tables. there is an outdoor portion with seats for smoking. overall it's always a good vibe at this bar. a good backup plan when other plans go awry.
this is the one of the best kept secrets of atwater village. &nbsp;shhhhhhh.......it's not highly advertised so i guess that's why people don't refer to it as much as other places...first, the decor is so cool. &nbsp;it's like a medieval dungeon, speckled with lights and beautiful antique tapestries, etc. &nbsp;and romantic fireplaces! &nbsp;ok, you can come here and get a really well made and fresh chicken salad. &nbsp;at the same time, the tater tots are delicious, as are the fried pickles and sliders, chicken wings, and burgers. &nbsp;there are other sides and choices of yummy things and healthier bits. &nbsp;it's a well thought out little menu. &nbsp;and lastly but most cooly is the indie rock/punk/etc music streaming through the jukebox. &nbsp;it's so rare to actually really like the music at an establishment. &nbsp;it's not commercial but rather....special! &nbsp;(also, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is yummy and cheap!)
love the atmosphere. the griffin is the perfect name for this place. dark lighting, hipster, and good music. it's a nice place to meet a small group of friends or a date for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the inside makes me feel like i'm at sherlock holmes house.
i found this place on yelp and went with a friend for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on friday. &nbsp;we got there a little early (around 4:30 pm), but this was perfect as we wanted one of the couch seats near the fire. &nbsp;the food was really good and reasonably priced. &nbsp;my favorite items were the tater tots (haven't had those in ages!) and the short rib pot roast soup (delicious and very filling). &nbsp;the decor was cute &amp; cozy, and the vibe was very chill. &nbsp;it's the perfect neighborhood bar. &nbsp;i look forward to going back!
a charming and dimly lit lounge with an outside patio for those who enjoy the spring breeze tugging at their hair as they enjoy their beer of choice. my friend and i chose to sit outside as we sipped on our peronis ($5 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special + on tap = a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> customer). &nbsp;there were only two other guys outside at the time and the place was relatively empty, but i can imagine they are packed any other night.the girl behind the bar was sweet! the bathrooms were clean and the lounge itself was very nice. it's a great place to bring a date and of course, to hang out with some friends. i parked a couple of blocks away near thinking i was close by, but there was plenty of street parking available.
this bar was a minute walk from our old office location so needless to say it was the common watering hole. &nbsp;staff is always great, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, smoking area out back, good music, good crowed with a mix of hipster.
the front door men are very nice and do a great job! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at midnight is awesome!!! we got the spicy chicken wings and they were actually pretty good! also, try their blonde beer and moscow mule!! service is good and the vibe and ambiance is hipster meets hollywood. i also love the dark lighting atmosphere with the fire pits ...and the music goes well with the scene.
this is definitely the place for drinks, as they are strong, but not so much the place for food. my friend and i came here around 6pm on a friday night for one of those after work <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> things as well as to get some grub. the jack and coke i ordered was definitely fat! i could tell when i got it by the color that there was more jack than coke in there. the food we ordered wasn't so awesome. we had the blt and the combination sliders. the blt was very ordinary - bacon, lettuce, tomato on an english muffin with a side of tots. the sliders weren't very tasty. the buns were over-toasted and charred, so we tasted a lot of burnt. the pork slider was salty and the hamburger and lamb sliders were sweet. as for the ambiance, we definitely enjoyed sitting by the fire and having drinks while conversing about bunch of nothing. at the time we went, it was still mellow with a mostly older crowd. i don't know what the crowd is like after <span class="highlighted">hours</span> as we left griffin's past 8pm. they also have a nice, varied seating arrangement. you can sit at the bar, the booth, tables, by the fire pits, or outside in their patio. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as i saw last night:$4 draft beers, $4 well drinks, $5 glass wine. food consisted of corn dogs, mac and cheese, fries/tots, and a blt.
i came here with laura s. a few months ago for dinner and drinks to celebrate her friend's birthday. we were able to find street parking really easily and the place was pretty empty (at least when we arrived) since it was a weeknight.their food service <span class="highlighted">hours</span> are:(sun-thurs) 4pm-11pm(fri-sat) 4pm-12midnight, with a special &quot;late night menu&quot; from 12-1amand they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day from 4-7pm. pretty sweet! during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> the draft beers are $5-6 with well drinks at $5. wines by the glass are $6.i ordered the following:house burger: 7oz all natural, hormon free, organic california beef ground in house. with greens, tomato, onion. served with chips and pickles (on the side), on a village bakery bun.-- i also added munster cheese (+$1) and substituted their hand cut french fries for the chips (+$3). because of the low lighting (let's be honest, it's because my camera quality is poor), i don't have any pictures to show you, but the burger was good and i enjoyed my meal. i don't regret any of it ;)the basil-ade: house infused basil vodka, fresh lemon, and house made mint simple syrup-- light and refreshing, just the way i like it!laura seemed to like her burger and drinks here, and later when the birthday girl and her friends showed up everyone had a good time. there were several booths/tables in the back corner where we hung out and it was a nice space for our group. the place is pretty darkly lit but it looks really hip and the staff are friendly (at least when you can get ahold of them, which can be a challenge). the ladies' room was pretty nice as well, which is always a plus. while i wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, i definitely would not mind stopping in for a drink and a bite if i were in the area.
i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with my co workers. as soon as i walked in i knew i would love this place. the griffin is very dark, mysterious and chill with a jukebox playing great music. they have 3 fire pits/fireplaces. we sat at one of them. &nbsp;unfortunately, i wasn't able to have any alcohol so i wont be judging the drinks although the people i was with did say they were strong so that's always a good thing. i did have food though. i tried the blt with fried egg and tater tots. the tater tots were ok nothing too exciting. the blt was so good. this is something i would recommend. the bread has some sort of sauce toasted on to it.i don't know what sauce my guess is pesto. it was really great. i also had a bite of my co workers slider and that was also really good. i will definitely be coming back for more <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> at the griffin.
came here for a birthday party. &nbsp;we had a great time!our party was set to start at 8 pm, but 3 of us got there at about 7 pm to claim a seating area. &nbsp;its basically first come first serve. &nbsp;its not a huge bar, but definitely spacious. &nbsp;we were going to have at least 20 people at our party, so we reserved a whole fireplace area, which includes 2 semi circle leather couches. &nbsp;the fireplace is in the middle. &nbsp;from what i remember, they have 2 fireplace areas. &nbsp;on the side (against the wall), you'll find more seating, but no fireplace. &nbsp;they also have a back room you can reserve for $500. &nbsp;we opted to do the fireplace. since we were there at 7 pm, we enjoyed <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and food until 8 pm. &nbsp;the beer was only $2-4 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;the food they serve is really good. &nbsp;i love their potato skins and steak fries. &nbsp; our guests arrived at 8 pm. &nbsp;even after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, drinks are definitely cheaper than most bars. &nbsp;they have unique beer - not your usual tap. &nbsp;they have a bar menu with descriptions of each beer (if you're not familiar with the different types of beer).our friends brought a birthday cake. &nbsp;we weren't sure how to handle it without plates and forks. &nbsp;we didn't want to get charged for it either. &nbsp;but we asked one of the guys and he gladly brought down paper plates and forks for us. &nbsp;it was really nice of him. &nbsp;so, we were able to enjoy the cake.the staff there are super nice. &nbsp;and they're always coming around to clean your area. &nbsp;i thought that was nice, especially with a big party.we happened to go on a busy night. &nbsp;there was another birthday or two, so the bar was packed. &nbsp;it was also a friday night.in general, its a great place. &nbsp;all of our guests loved the place. &nbsp;it has a nice lounge feeling to it with dim lights and fireplaces. &nbsp;i thought it was great and absolutely perfect. &nbsp;they also play great music.oh &amp; parking is easy! &nbsp;there's plenty of street parking.
the griffin... enough nice things can't be said about it. &nbsp;on los feliz, there are about three legit bars: the roost, big foot lodge, and this. &nbsp;while the roost is super divey and big foot lodge is super trendy (see: its campfire theme), the griffin toes the line between both, having a worn-in feel without being too rough around the edges and having a hip vibe without being too hipster-y.the drink prices are reasonable, especially if you can make <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and the service is always friendly. &nbsp;hectic when it's busy but what bar isn't?the fireplaces and dim lighting make for a great date spot and the outdoor patio is perfect for hanging out with friends.i haven't had too much of their food but their fried pickles were pretty delicious. &nbsp;i'd personally stick with the drinks.
simply said: his place is a hidden gem. the griffin defines what it means to be a lounge. the inside is so warm cozy and very intimate. the service was amazing, the bartender is very very nice (red head with long curly hair). on top of all the greatness they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday, yes i said everyday, from 5-7. you are missing out if you don't come to this place!!
mixed crowd, fun people watching, good selection of beers on tap and special <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks as well. i have yet to try the food but i like the vibe of this place, very chill, a good place to get together with friends for drinks and conversation. my list visit they had strawberry fruli on tap, yum! it's a white beer with strawberry puree, not too sweet, i could drink it all night!
quiet on off nights but it can get cracking on friday's and saturdays. &nbsp;bartenders aren't the friendliest. &nbsp;beer list is pretty robust with a big craft beer selection (not huge but good). &nbsp;you can also get 4 dollar olympias all day everyday. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great...5 dollar sides and 5 dollar draft beers from 5-7. &nbsp;smoking section outside with two bars on the inside plus fire places both indoor and outdoor. &nbsp;probably the best place to go in atwater village. &nbsp;no waiting in lines, just go in and enjoy a good crowd and decent drinks.
i found out about the griffin when one of my old coworkers had his going away party there after work one night. &nbsp;it's perfect because it's so close to my work that <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is only minutes away. &nbsp;the people there are really chill and the drinks are made strong. &nbsp;as for the food, order anything with tater tots or just tater tots by themselves. &nbsp;sure, they're probably the frozen ore ida's that you can get at costco or ralphs, but for some reason, it's really good there when coupled with beer.
it's time for katie to update her review - the food is approaching fantastic levels (mostly because of a fearless kitchen that is embracing all things seasonal and nummy that go with drinkables - meaning new creations from thai, korean, indian, moroccan sources that are emerging daily on the board.) when kalbi short-rib poutine fries (with sauteed kimchee) appear and sell-out within <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of opening, you know you've got something-something going. &nbsp;the burgers and sliders are well up to the umami's and father's office, when they start. &nbsp;then they top it and side them with things heretofore found only in gastro-truck land. and tots. topped tots. very <span class="highlighted">happy</span> crunchy tots. oxtail tots. &nbsp;the micro-/local- brew, ale, cider, ginger beers, other board is awesome. &nbsp;the dailys board (next to the register) is inspired. there are (i vaguely recall) 2 separate <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> times to go exploring that vast wall-o-drink without reserve. the place packs in the evenings to late evenings (as do a lot of the atw bars, so it's a thing. club tee-yee, maybe?) i think that's when the most comments about service have been driven - it's a small staff. &nbsp;but i'd compare grif to a place like edendale and say a packed night is downright welcoming in comparison at the grif. if you're at a table on a packed night your chances of finding the roaming server had better come with a bicycle flag and a laser pointer. &nbsp;but bring your order list to the bar, and you'll be back in minutes. my most memorable visit lately was when we were sitting at the bar on an early evening and i was curious about the odd wooden glass-fronted box up on the shelf over the register. &nbsp;in the whiskey menu among the several dozen in it (by no means a bourbon bar, but it's a pretty good selection) is one that stands out. &nbsp;by an extra zero. &nbsp;meaning $8, 10, 20.... $500? &nbsp;there's a great story behind it, and that bottle in the case. and there are at last count, only 23 left in the world.
loved this bar - it was cute and cozy inside with 2 fireplaces to stay warm and the food was awesome! &nbsp;had the short rib pot roast stew which was yummy over creamy mashed potatoes. &nbsp;the white bean hummus crostini was great and the blt with tater tots was also very good. &nbsp;it came with a large side of crispy tater tots that had a slight kick to them and the aioli sauce in the blt along with the grilled sourdough bread was very yummy. &nbsp;two of us shared these dishes and were completely stuffed by the end of it. &nbsp;if you're able to get here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (ends at 7), even better - for all that food plus a glass of wine it was only $20 each!!!great food, great value, great bar! &nbsp;you can park on the metered streets around the area or we ended up parking in the mega lot across the street where mimi's cafe and best buy are.
well now this is quite rewarding, i've been dying for a change of scenery... sorry hollywood i just need something more fulfilling. i've explored most of downtown la as most do once they get tired of hollywood, but i never thought of coming here to this part of town.... to atwaterit was a saturday night and we had 45 minutes before our reservation at tam o' shanter. i figured we could get drinks at tam, but let's be real if i can explore a new pup bar or whatever without jeopardizing my reservation and at a leisurely pace then of course i will. we entered the griffin and it was empty however we did stumble upon their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! much to my surprise we were looking at $5 imported and local beers on tap and $5 glasses of wines and the bar tender was so kind and let us sample some beers. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 7 days a week from 5-7pm food is also available. the ambiance makes the griffin remarkably foreign. for a moment you'll feel like you're in scotland, ireland or maybe at a pub in england. i'm not much of a drinker but this is a cozy place, it puts you in the mood for a drink. i love the fireplaces and the teak furniture. it's such a nice feature, i think the cooler months are more suitable for the griffin. all together it's a win. i appreciate a kind staff and thoughtful design. there's a sliding wooden door that can separate the two bars for private parties. it's spacious and clean inside with tons of seating including booths. i'm now more inclined to explore the area. one of the beers we sampled was from a brewery just a few blocks away i think it's called golden road, anyway she said i wouldn't miss the big yellow building with a beer garden and a large parking lot. i'm going to be back to explore, i need to try the food at griffin, it looked so good... i saw a couple kill a plate of meat and potatoes.
griffin is a great little bar. if gargoyles were to hangout somewhere before a shift of ledge perching, i think they would hang out at the griffin. the beers on tap were very tasty, and the bartenders seemed to recommend some great brews based on my likes and dislikes, she should work for google. i tasted a couple of new ipa's here and was impressed that they had a great selection of craft beer in bottles. my boo was drinking girly drinks and she had no complaints with the cadillac margaritas. we were here on a saturday between 6-8 and took advantage of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tater tots and $5 draughts.griffin is a laid back bar with crispy food and a lot of brick arches. this place is the bees knees.
came here for a birthday last night and the place is dead on the weekdays but alive on weekends. but i like it like that. i had peace and quiet!food:ordered the food at the bar and sat at a table. i ordered the turkey burger and it was like thanksgiving in a bun - cranberry, stuffing, turkey burger... and chips on the side. i thought the turkey burger was dry... i still ate it cuz i was hungry. the chips was good and my friend's french fries were really good. drinks:i got the moscow mule and i got it done the right way. in a copper cup (you have to give your id to them to get that drink because people steal the cups) and it was good. i love the cup it comes in and it made me feel like a hardcore drinker... which i'm not, but still... cool. i felt cool. there are some cheap drinks that they offer and i love it. there is a mystery shot for $4. what?! that's not even <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> time! it's all the time. wuddd...ambiance:so laid back and very cool. the stone walls are cool and it's just a really hip place. yes, hipsters would love it. great for a photoshoot too.service:standardprices:pretty good.parking:streetoverall:great place for drinks!
score. this place was a very pleasant surprise!it was just before 7pm when we walked in to start our friday night flagrancy's. by then, the place was already somewhat crowded. i thought, alright, let's stay for a while... and stay we did.6 pints for $16 later, i was really taken back by how diverse the crowd was: from grannies to corporate drones, it was not the hipster haven i thought it would be. and you know what? that was fine by me. we had a great time. a lot of drinks. a very attentive bartendress who totally hooked it up - <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or not. we were there early enough to grab a booth, so comfort came effortlessly.overall, an awesome, dim-lit, and sexy place to start or end a night.
i met up with a friend for drinks after work one day and was excited when he mentioned the griffin. &nbsp;i had heard great things about this place, but hadn't had a chance to try it out and i am <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to report it lived up to my expectations!they have an eclectic menu ranging from tatter tots, fish n' chips, and fried pickles! &nbsp;they also have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> combo a schlitz and hot wings for $5. &nbsp;we sat on the patio in one of the corners, enjoying a cool tuesday evening. &nbsp;it gave us the perfect vantage to people watch and really enjoy the griffin ambiance at its best. &nbsp;people are friendly, drinks were flowing, and a good time was had by everyone!
love this place. i eat here at least once a week, and i swear it's court ordered ;) <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from m-f 5-7pm. there is also a wed wing special that you can get the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal of 5 wings and beer for $5 all day. &nbsp;it's pretty good wings. been trying a different dish off the regular menu each time i've come. haven't had a bad one yetdessert. is freaking good. do not leave without ordering a dessert. my favor is the peanut butter chocolate pie with peanut butter whip cream, but it looks like they may have taken it off the menu last week. both bartenders recommend the goat cheesecake instead and that was also incredible. really fun beer and drink &nbsp;selection. &nbsp;the mystery shot is $4 if you want to take your chances. service: is great and all the bartenders i've had were great. they have very well trained staff for a bar. parking: street parking is limited but if you are willing to walk, you can get parking. it might just take a few tries and some walking. make sure you read the signs before you leave your near a parking meter cause some of the meters are 30 mins and <span class="highlighted">hour</span> until midnight. overall: the food is excellent, the desserts are amazing, and the kitchen is open till midnight on the weekday. you can get amazing food late at night in a bar with great people. how wickedly cool is that?
the griffin holds a special place in my heart. celebrated my 21st birthday there as well all my birthdays minus maybe one or two years. it's literally at the corner of my house so you can understand one of the main reasons why i love this bar. the other reasons why is simply all the memories i've shared here with different people over the years. no to get to the real pros and cons of the place.pros: really stiff drinks/ location/ awesome patio for smokers/ for the most part, really nice bartenders/ crowd is usually cool, rarely any problems there/ really awesome food and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is money.cons: can be a little pricey for some/ sort of limited selection in beer/ constant rotating of said beer selection.this is my favorite bar and i look forward to spending much more time at my local bar.
be on time for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and you will be the happiest person. this is my opinion of a perfect wednesday night stress reliever. i always sit outside with my girls and just gossip the night away. we usually become emotional after a few drinks and start talking about the bad incidents in our lives like how my goldfish only had one eye when i was 4. (that scarred me) haha anyway on a serious note. i love love love did i mention love the outside patio area. the dim lighting, the breeze from the los feliz speech limit, the perfect company and the perfect class of pinot noir just make my life easier.food! obsessed with the fries here. my boyfriend calls them &quot;crack fries&quot; they really are addicting and the ranch is homemade deliciousness. the mini burgers with mushroom and cheese and just like ughhh meant to be together. i love all everything on their menu. why 4 stars if i'm so satisfied? well the alcohol is the problem here. they have good quality hard liquor but they are just doing something wrong back there. it's most likely the mixers because something just tastes way too artificial here so i always opt out for the wine. (pinot noir)
i've been here a couple of times for some good <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> with co-workers. &nbsp;i like the dark &quot;red&quot; environment&amp;the music, too. &nbsp;sometimes i like not hearing everything and pretending i heard everything. &nbsp;drinks are good here and not once have i ever been disappointed when i go here. sidebar: and heard that kanye was here there one time? so i heard... anyway and they serve some snacks like corn dogs (probably from costco) and fries (from costco too). &nbsp;it can get packed and seats may run out, but overall, a good drinking environment.have your id and make sure it is not expired (duh..happened to my friend)don't leave your belongings (i left my atm card one time and forgot my purse and jacket. &nbsp;i was already passed out and when my friends reached my house, we went back for my purse) good times! no cover. street parking! 4 stars for street parking.
first of all, when you walk in it makes you feel like you've just stumbled into a bar that frodo and the gang would have stopped in on their journey to mordor. from the dark atmosphere, the brick interior and the fireplaces, i feel like it's a cozy pub right outside of the shire. &nbsp;this place is definitely my favorite for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the blood orange whiskey sour is where it's at, also their moscow mules are pretty killer as well. now, let's talk about their food. the mac &amp; cheese is to die for. seriously i know this is a bar but their food is great. i also love their tomato bisque, fried pickles and everything else that's vegetarian friendly on the menu. the staff is super friendly and helpful. i've never had a bad experience. this place can get super packed on the weekends but the street parking isn't too terrible. also remember that they don't let sports team logos on any of your attire, they made my boyfriend drop his la kings hat off in the car before he was allowed in.
i just had a farewell shindig here last night and it was the perfect venue for a small get together of about 20-30 people. &nbsp;the bartender with the nose piercing was super cool and cute btw -- wish i had gotten her name! &nbsp;she was very attentive, friendly and provided excellent customer service. :) they have large seating areas with small tables centered around a fireplace that was just the right size for me and my friends. &nbsp;it was great because most of my friends came early for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and it wasn't crowded at all. &nbsp;but later on after about 11pm the place got pretty busy. &nbsp;however, the bouncer is good about not letting the place get too packed and would only allow people in as others exited so it was still quite comfortable inside. &nbsp;all in all, i had a great time and a wonderful experience at the griffin and i highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a chill bar in the los feliz/atwater village area.
i've been here a number of times and it just seems to be getting better and better. &nbsp;i pick and choose what times and days i go, so it works out perfectly. &nbsp;now that it's winter, the fireplaces are handy and the juke has been updated. &nbsp;fred at the front door is lovely as always. &nbsp; clean heads, great drinks, (go to andrew for a perfect lemon drop). &nbsp;we had a great new year's here with old friends and many cocktails. &nbsp;cabbed it home, all was well. &nbsp;for me, it's a good location and the relaxed atmosphere is what i need for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or just to tie one on. &nbsp;easy to park, decent prices... what else do you need? i just need to hear lemy singing ace of spades and i'm good....
so what do you need when you step up to a bar and go to place an order? a footrail obviously! this is perhaps the single most important aspect of a real bar. do they have a footrail? the griff sure does! so it is a real bar to me woo woo =)not only does it have that iconic conveyance for a real bar, they serve some decent drinks, have some reduced lighting, some tasty vittles, and an honest pour! i was here for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> not too long ago and it was definitely a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> &nbsp;enough time for me to have spent about 4-5 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> here before running off to another joint to go dancing with some friends for a while.pro tip: park down the street in the neighborhood for free parking. if you cant find this place due to its being rather inconspicuous, look for the tam o'shanter prime rib joint which is directly across the street. the building is very nondescript and unassuming from the exterior. it is 2 stories as well.pro tip #2: do not wear any sports team regalia as they do not allow that inside. they have a smoking area out on the patio for all the chain smokers and a large number of chairs, fireplaces, benches and tables set up around the interior to make a unique and comfortable environment. the atmosphere is conducive to having a good time with a small, medium, or large party. heck, if you just want to go grab a drink solo, you can be easily accommodated for that as well.overall i really enjoyed this place. the food was pub food, the drinks were tasty, the environment superb, hell they even had decent service. so overall, you bet your bibby i am going back here when i get the chance!
a real treat. &nbsp;i have been a handful of times when it is packed but everyone is good spirits and ive had a good time. &nbsp;for the first timers it takes a few minutes to realize that you go to the bar and order your first round and any kind of food. &nbsp;after you sit down and enjoy your food and drink, a waitress will then come check on you and make sure you are good and need any additional food and drink. &nbsp;this makes for a fun adventure since the bar is packed on weekends and the bartenders are running around like nurses in an er unit of a busy hospital...so have some patience.last night however i went and it was a ghost town, so it was like i was a first timer all over again. &nbsp;i brought a true newbie and a picky drinker, but the bartender was on top of it and made a drink that was damn good. &nbsp;it was actually a nice and quiet night in a cool little pub. &nbsp;as far as food goes, we ordered tator tots (my recommendation...you cant go to the griffin and not get the tots) while my date ordered the chicken strips (hand breaded...little greasy...but damn good). &nbsp;our two drinks and two foods were all on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which brought our total to only $22.of note...the last time i went there, i was told my boston red sox hat had to stay in the car, but last night my usc hat was allowed. &nbsp;when i asked the doorman about this,he was very nice in explaining that due to local gang that sports dodger gear (shocking) , they dont allow any pro team apparel. &nbsp;college sports is totally fine and even minor league is fine he said. &nbsp;so dress accordingly.
this place is cool enough looking, although i get the disneyland reference one reviewer mentioned. &nbsp;its in our hood and its always good to see new places opening in atwater village. &nbsp;we went at 8. &nbsp;i suppose i am getting old...but i am hoping they will consider opening earlier...its a bar not a club...lets see some &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>&quot;. &nbsp;also, this isn't a dive bar..we were a little surprised when the bartender couldn't serve me a martini with a twist. &nbsp;she claimed &quot;they don't do that kind of fancy stuff..&quot; &nbsp;how hard is it to add a lemon rind my friend? it's one of the most standard drinks out there. &nbsp;its not like i asked for a mojito with mint and a sugar cane.
i really enjoy this bar. i've been here at different times and on different nights. they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> of $1 off any drink from open until 8pm every night, at least weeknights. the employees for the most part are really cool, a few of the bartenders are really cool, friendly and knowledgeable, a few aren't. one of the guys who works here is really cool, don't know if he is a bartender or manager, but i think he is in charge of ordering the liquor and he knows the scotch &amp; bourbon there, which they have a good selection of. he has made some good recommendations on brands that i haven't had before. they don't have a large selection of beer here. pretty much the same layout as the one in vegas with the fireplaces &amp; couches and booths. its cozy, i feel very comfortabe here, the brick arches are cool. they have a second bar they open when it gets busy on the weekends. there is a smoking area outside where you can sit and drink and smoke. i was surprised to find on my last visit that they had cacaca and absinthe. they have a jukebox with buzzcocks, stooges, t rex as well as more modern indie rock stuff.
wow...from the exterior i would have never expected the griffin to look the way it does from the outside. &nbsp;this place is fab! &nbsp;i finally found a home away from home. &nbsp;it's a little castle-esque meets haunted mansion. &nbsp;the only reason i say haunted mansion is that the way the lighting hits the paintings on the wall, i think they pictures are moving! &nbsp;(and no, i wasn't high).i was surprised to find there were no tvs here because every &quot;loungey&quot; type place in la has 'em but i think that's a really good thing. &nbsp;it forces you to do something that you don't do all that often, talk. &nbsp;and something i do even less often, listen. &nbsp;the music on the jukebox is very diverse and you'll really find comfort in that. &nbsp;me being a 5 senses kind of person.the drinks are great, the sofas/seats comfy, fire pits are lovely. &nbsp;this griffin i feel is a bit better than the one in vegas because it's roomier. &nbsp;however, go to the one in vegas if you get a chance. &nbsp;it's in the newer &quot;revitalized&quot; part of downtown and it's a nice chance to get away from the tourists, ringing slot machines and expensive drinks. &nbsp;i can't remember the last time i paid for a drink in vegas (other than getting them free at the tables) that was less than $10...the guinness there was $5. &nbsp;i haven't been to this one on the weekend yet but i am finding if i need a place to &quot;hoan&quot; my skills (ie. talk and listen), i'll come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during the week...which works to save a few buckaroos. &nbsp;go, you won't regret it!
this place is a good neighborhood bar. it's big and there's usually always a place to sit, and they have an outdoor enclosed smoking patio. the fireplaces are always burning which is a nice touch. the food is mediocre but i've been there enough times to know which items to order (no to the fried pickles, but the fries are okay). while the majority of their staff i find to be friendly and competent, there is a bartender named john who's rude and slow. the last time i visited the griffin during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, john was outside having a cigarette. he had seen us enter and although he was the only bartender on duty, my friend and i sat at the bar for 10 mins while john finished smoking outside. when he finally took our order i asked him about one of the specials pairing a beer with a food item. i'd never heard of that beer before so i asked if there was an alternative to which john replied with a straight face &quot;i could just not give you the beer.&quot; rude! my friends and i have all made complaints about this bartender and hopefully he improves his performance/attitude or is replaced. on busy nights, the lines to get a drink are ridiculously long. they need more/better bartenders! otherwise, the bar is an okay local hangout. decent music always playing and good drinks.
be warned, they have a very strict policy of no hats with any sports team logo. i don't know if this extends to shirts and jackets, but hats with a sports team logo are definitely not allowed. some of the staff is cool about this policy and will reprimand you nicely , some of the staff (the manager jason g, specifically) gets very upset and will yell at you if you violate the rule. so just avoid to hassle of getting treated like you're some kind of idiot and leave your hat in the car. i didn't like getting yelled at by the manager jason g as i was getting up to leave and accidentally put my hat on too early for his liking. all this after hiding it under the bar all evening. anyway... &nbsp;the buffalo wings + mango/habanero sauce is awesome, but the wings are tiny. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price is 5 wings for $5 which is a bit pricey. the crostini was really tasty, but again the portion was on the small size. tots.. my god.. what can you say that hasn't been said already?..seriously? can you mess up tots? but they were forking good!. when i arrived (7.30p thu) street parking was packed and i ended up with a couple minute walk, but by the time we left the street seemed to have cleared out (9p). the decor is pretty cool and there were plenty of places to find a seat. there is a good balance of bar, table and lounge type seating that are spread across an open room with fireplaces. overall it was ok, but i see a lot of room for improvement. i'd go back, i guess, &nbsp;unless i'm wearing a hat that i don't want to take off.. in which case.. i can do better...since posting this this morning, i have received a letter reprimanding my review from the manager jason g. he obviously thinks i am acting &quot;extreme&quot; in my assessment of his actions and my experience at the griffin. i'm sure he'd love to hear from you if have any questions. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=c8n7i1sdemxzpw_pk6tsna">yelp.com/user_details?us…</a> he obviously doesn't review, but rather looks for reviews concerning his aggressive nature in dealing with customers.i dropped the rating from 2 to 1 after reading in his letter that he, &quot;wasn't too stressed about it&quot; and that i &quot;actually seemed apologetic for forgetting about the hat rule, quickly removing it.&quot; the only issue was.. i was stressed about your abrasive and inconsiderate behavior and you didn't care.. until i wrote this...cheers!
i've been to the griffin in las vegas in dt vegas on fremont street but heard there was one in silver lake. decided to check this place out on saturday night. my birthday is next month and wanted to find a spot not so much where there is dancing but a place that's low key where we can mingle with each other and have a great time. as soon as we pulled up i knew we had a winner. valet parking (not expensive). as soon as you walk it was the same as the vegas location but smaller. the dim lighting and the fireplaces made some good memories come to mind from my vegas adventures. the place was busy with patrons but not so busy that you couldn't walk around. i like that they have an outside patio area where patrons can smoke. the drinks were great and i thought reasonable but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials can't be beat. they have a food menu with great selections,which we didn't try but looked good. this location has a juke box which was playing some great music that night. they do have a back room but you have to guarantee 500 people. they do have a smaller area in the corner that you can reserve for a party of 10-20 people. the waitress was great and the bartender good. you get a variety of a crowd that is not stuck up! same as the vegas location. i don't know if they have a live dj on saturday nights at this location but he vegas location does. if the silver lake location does than it's a bonus for us! i will be booking my space for next month for sure.
the first time i was at this place was a month or two after it opened last year in 2007 when my cousin's friend had his birthday there. i had my birthday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> w/ co-workers later that year and have been in awe of the place. i haven't been back to this spot until last night, where i met up w/ a few co-worker friends and my neighbor, who told me it was their 1 year anniversary night. since it was their 1 yr anniversary, they had $1 draft beers from 8pm - closing so i texted any of my friends who i thought would be interested and would actually meet me there. now, when i went for my birthday, they weren't able to serve food yet, but last night i ordered a tomato-basil pizza and chicken strips w/ home made potato chips. i must say, i liked the freshly made personal size pizza and the chicken strips were all breast meat. they have an a rating from the l..a. county department of public health (i didn't expect anything less!) too! :)the women's restroom is pretty clean for those of you picky about that. although i never went up to the jukebox to pick music, whoever was picking it was doing a pretty good job - i didn't hate it, and actually kind of liked it. it will probably be a regular place for me to go and just chill (by myself or w/ friends). i don't have an excuse, it's not even that far from my place.kudos goes to my neighbor who told me about the anniversary special! i would not have known, nor gone yesterday had it not been for him. one of my favorite parts of this bar is the fireplace, as well as the overall decor. it's got this medieval, yet contemporary feel to it. if you smoke, the outdoor patio is pretty comfy with cushiony seats (similar to bay-window type seating) to just hang out and chill. there is no cover charge, and when i went last night, i went after work dressed in sneakers, jeans and a polo. at least i didn't have to go all the way home to change. parking is just tough to find, but nothing will stop me from going there b/c of that. i'll just go early like i did yesterday ;)
i love drinking just a little bit more than i like eating. &nbsp;i should do a drinking blog, but it would get boring really fast. &nbsp;each post would go something like this: me at bar, me ordering a pint of beer, me making new friends and then me convincing those new friends that i'm o.k. to drive myself home. having said that, i love givin' props to a good drinking hole and tonight that hole the griffin this dungeon-esk bar is the newest edition to the atwater village/los feliz/glendale area. the interior feels like a posh dungeon, complete with ceiling and walls made of stone bringing an old english comfy feeling to a dungeon atmosphere (ok enough with the dungeon). two fireplaces, comfy, cushioned booths, and outside patio area a brilliant jukebox stocked with the creme-de-la-creme of indie-rock (the cure, the smiths, echo and the bunnymen, the postal service, elo, ). if you are there and someone is playing arcadefire in it's entirety, chances are that's me sitting up at the bar sipping on a stella. the best thing about this bar? the staff, the manager andrew and the &nbsp;bartenders esther, patience, shane, steve, and shannon rock so hard you'd &nbsp;think they were paying me to say this until you experienced it for yourself. so i was all set for night of high class boozin'. &nbsp;i was with some friends and we were intrigued by the interesting mix of people: retro punk rockers, t.v. writers, and guys in suits who probably left work for a quick drink and found themselves on an accidental bender. &nbsp;they'll probably show up at the office tomorrow in the same suit smelling of booze and strippers. &nbsp;i know. i know. you're getting thirsty aren't you?long story short: the pours are potent, the staff is rad, and the jukebox is good, they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that starts at 5, and are even going to be serving food very soon... is that tater-tots i smell? yeesss!!!!!
piss poor customer service, but fantabulous food.this place may excel with its fantastic food and tasty drinks, but its reputation (in my opinion) is seriously hurt by the ridiculously poor service these me-against-the-world servers and employees with piss poor attitudes.a zero out of 5 for service.we came in on a saturday afternoon (~6:30) during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sat in the corner. for 15 minutes almost, we sat there, unless someone told us in such a tone &quot;umm, it isn't 9 yet, so you're going to have to go up to the bar and order yourself&quot;. gee, no shit, thank you for the condescension. already i was beginning to feel apprehensive about the place.so i went up to the bar and ordered two drinks and some food. they gave me the little placard to put at our table. and nothing else. so i went to sit down.about 5 minutes later this guy in skinny jeans, a beanie, and a scruffy ass bead comes with more condescension... &quot;did you order drinks? you're going to have to go and pay for them now&quot; as he rolls his eyes. yeah, no shit hipster. i didn't steal the drinks, they weren't even made for me yet.this same guy gave us stinking attitude at least two more times during our evening... i won't go into details, because thinking about it makes me see a white hot light. so anyway... he and the other 5 employees that were there went to sit down at the bar again and talk and have drinks and food, instead of helping out the only customers there. oh, right... did i forget to mention that we were the only patrons at the griffin until about 7:30 and we were still getting treated like shit?ok at this point i was fuming and was getting ready to punch hipsterboy in the kidney and make him piss blood, but then our food came out.amazing food. seriously. a 6 out of 5.blt with tater tots, an order of fries to share, and a mini burger.mind blown. the blt was a little buttery but flavorful. they made a blt taste more amazing than i've had at any other place. the fries were crisp with a hint of pepper with homemade ketchup.... and the miniburger was coated with a tent of cheese.afterwards, we had the ice cream sundae with homemade french vanilla ice cream... i've never had $12 ice cream, but somehow i knew this was worth the money.needless to say overall i was amazed by the food... and still a bit ker-fluffed (is that a word) about the piss-in-my-drink service.so this place gets a (6+0)/2. would be better, but won't be until the employees take a step back and take the sticks out of their asses. it took them 15 minutes to close our tab.my final words about this place? expect shitty service, especially if you're not dressed like a hipster. i think if my pants were tight with my twig and berries stuck like a division symbol, i would have been able to communicate with these people. more specifically... if you see an employee in skinny jeans, a deep v shirt, a beanie, with a scruffy ass beard, walk away. he thinks you are trying to oppress him and will treat you as such. find another employee... they will be slightly nicer.
love it, love it, love it. i'm biased, because i work there (security), but i hang there too. the decor is great! medieval comfort, with plenty of leather couches and 2 bars when it's busy. the fireplaces are wonderful when you're coming in out of the cold, especially while it was raining over the past month. not many bars have a heated, well ventilated smoking patio. that alone takes this spot to another level. i can sip my scotch and smoke my cigars in comfort, without being overwhelmed by other people's smoke either.the crowd here is very cool, especially the regulars and locals. i love the neighborhood, and the patrons reflect the laid back, personable professionals that have populated the area. there's some youngins from time to time, but for the most part i'd say the age range is 25-40, and generally good folks to share a drink with anytime.it gets pretty crowded on the weekends, and sometimes there's a line after 10pm, usually only when a lot of birthday parties fill up the place. the griffin is great for groups, and the word is definitely out! we hate to start a line, but usually you won't be waiting for longer than 10 minutes or so. plus you can always walk a few blocks down to the roost or bigfoot lodge for a bit, and come back when it's settled down. you will be back, trust me. it's the swankiest spot on the block!there's a lot of lovely ladies coming through here on the regular too, which is just wonderful! as if the place needed more or a draw, and then ya fill it up with hotties! thanx to all my fellow yelpers who have helped make this a great place to work.rarely will you see a scuffle, thanx to the awesome crowd who frequent this place, and when something does go down, it doesn't last long. it's just not that kinda party. since people usually show up in groups, they take care of one another anyways, so the belligerent a-holes are generally escorted out by a friend rather then necessitating security to step in. it's nice.if we do have to handle something, i bet you we'll be as respectful as possible. we consider our patrons like friends for the most part, and will treat you as such.i wish the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food was better, and i'd love to hear a little more funk from the jukebox, but the drinks are good, and there's an impressive selection of liquor as well.gotta love it.ps - i wrote r.n. a response to her review, which is totally bullsh*t. i hope her friends will offer counter-reviews after witnessing the night's events first hand.04/24/08 update: &nbsp;we now sell parliament, marboro red, and camel light cigs at the bar! no more lamenting over the liquor store next door being closed so early. and, mainly to appease our wonderful regulars, you can buy a loosey for a quick fix, and avoid the guilt of buying a whole pack! i only smoke cigars, but i must say, i was impressed by this new addition. kudos management....and now, to wait for the check &nbsp;;p
eden-burger-bar-glendale
the decor is a bit dark for my taste. if i'm enjoying a burger and a beer in the afternoon.. i'd like some brightness in my life... i felt like i was at a lounge~however the service was amazing and the food was pretty good. we got the pastrami burger the veggie burger and the truffle parmesan onion rings. pastrami burger is def good nothing special.not bad. . the veggie burger is prob never order again. i just felt like i was biting into a hummus burger... the only flavor i from it. the only thing that really saved this review from receiving a 3 to a 4... was the onion rings. crunchy flavorful and just delicious. i'd def go back just to eat the onion rings~but if i could. this place would be 3.5<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> fyi.. half off all house wine
this place was a bit of a drive from where i live but i've heard rave reviews so i had to try it out. i am soooo glad i did, this place is amazing! you would never think that a place that serves such amazing gourmet burgers would be in a little strip mall in glendale, but it is worth the hype. i came on a tuesday night so it wasn't that busy and i had no wait at all. everything looked so good and i couldn't decide so my waitress (maren i think it was?) suggested the &quot;rehab&quot; burger which had all sorts of goodies, and a side of truffle fries. omg i have to give it up to her that was an excellent choice. she also let us know they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-6 on weekdays so we will definitely be coming back for that. also i don't know why there are bad reviews about the service and decor.. i thought it was a+. friendly servers and great food, what more could you ask for?!
eden burger bar is bizarre and feels like you are eating at some cheap replica of a vegas lounge complete with the second-hand smoke of patrons who smoke by the doorway. and i thought glendale was supposed to be implementing their &quot;fresh air ordinance&quot;. so yes, aside from the interestingly awkward interior design theme consisting of cushioned furniture and awkward chandeliers colored with the hues of purple, gray, and black, they seem to be really stingy with their air conditioning because it was not on. perhaps they think that by making people hot, they will drink more. wrong!you see, i have a hard time drinking beer when it's hot and stuffy like balls in a hipster's skinny jeans. because when you are hot temperature-wise, studies have shown that you tend to get angrier. if it was cooler inside, then i might have had a &quot;cooler&quot; experience. food-wise they offer decent burgers that are $10+ for the burger alone. they have a set number of burgers that are uncustomizable &quot;sang yoon-style&quot; that include exotic meats such as boar, duck, and lamb. but if you are looking for a good old-fashioned burger you may need to build it yourself. the wife and i just got the blue, which was a burger with bleu cheese. the pizza that we had was pretty tasty (we had the vino consisting of &nbsp;cheese with balsamic glaze) and averaged $10+ and the beers were decently priced since the owner owns the adjoining eden wine &amp; spirits liquor store. draft beer wise they have about 7-8 and the rest are all bottled. if you order a bottled beer you may see the server disappear down the connecting hallway to get the beer from the liquor store. lol. at the end of the day, the interior furniture combined with the lack of air flow and cigarette smoke made the whole place feel stuffy and uncomfortable. moreover, the absence of a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> made me an even more unhappy drinker.link to hot temperatures and hot tempers: <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.psychologytoday.com%2fblog%2fget-psyched%2f201307%2fhot-temperatures-and-hot-tempers&amp;s=bc356146d02359fa33b94fd5c3b0ba4d1c2e46bfef9ce011bce17c961d706228" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">psychologytoday.com/blog…</a>
gooooooooooooooooooooooood daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn my wallet hurt$!! $16 bucks for a burger -- the popular &quot;black label&quot; burger... and no fries!?!? wtf!? sh*t, i can go to ruth's chris during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and get an in-cred-ible burger with fries for &nbsp;-- envelope paleeze -- $7!!!granted, the quality of the black label burger (i keep wanting to say, &quot;black label society,&quot; ya know, the band fronted by ozzy's former guitar player zakk wylde) was a tad above a kobe burger, and it was neatly prepared, but it's portioned a little on the small side (envision three slider burgers rolled into one).but i did spring for the a small regular-style, string fries (they have three versions, one of them being sweet &amp; potato) for an extra $3 to make me feel like i had a complete meal, which was kinda on the too-salty side with parsely.friendly service, but it took like fooooooooooooooooooooooorever to get my credit card receipt because the server was on the phone taking a pick-up order. i also had to ask the server to refill my water ... instead of him coming back and asking if i needed a refill, or to check up on me.i was pleasantly surprised, though, by the small, and imtimate ambiance and contemporary white furniture and comfy purple cushining on the walls ... something you'd find - as someone else here on yelp mentioned - at the w hotel - definitely not something you'd find in glendale!i'll have to swing by during lunch to see if they have any lunch specials.
the d&eacute;cor is a little over the top, but the burger was really good.don't get me wrong. &nbsp;i love purple, but it reminds me of a nightclub with the sofas upholstered in purple velvet and the white vinyl chairs.food: &nbsp;4/5 starsdrinks:$2.00 for a mini soda bottle (no refills). &nbsp;my husband asked if he could have a grown up version. &nbsp;nah.....i guess not. &nbsp;$3.00 for an ice tea. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=o8lo2pvm19nyypbbycgsvg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>burgers etc.:hamburgers: &nbsp;i ordered the fig burger $12.00. &nbsp;not sure if i could figure out where the figs were, but i like the sundried tomatoes and gouda cheese. the ground beef was really tasty and reminded me of some really good homemade burgers. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gsmxa12ige106bh1hhlneq&amp;userid=o8lo2pvm19nyypbbycgsvg">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>my son ordered the firehouse for $10.00. &nbsp;he ate a couple bites, but i think it was a little too fancy for him. &nbsp; i did see people ordering some pizzas and they looked like new york style with a nice looking crust. &nbsp; i also saw a few kids while we were there, so i'll edit the business info which indicated that it isn't good for kids. &nbsp;i don't agree with that, especially at lunch time.my hubby liked the hot wings ($10.00 for 8.00). &nbsp;the truffle fries were very good. &nbsp; prices seemed a little steep at $44.00 for three of us and no alcholoic beverages, but maybe they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal. &nbsp;i looked on their website and could not determine if they do or not, so i would recommend calling.service: &nbsp;4/5 starsdezy was our server and she was good. &nbsp;she was new and wasn't too sure if they had any different breads like sourdough for the pastrami since my hubby doesn't like rye. &nbsp;no, they just have marble and rye.atmosphere: 3/5 starsi prefer a casual atmosphere for a burger joint with some windows or a nice relaxing patio. &nbsp;they had some tables outside, but they are right on a busy street, so i wouldn't sit out there. &nbsp; the purple velvet sofas were a little long in the seat, so if you have shorter legs you might be uncomfortable. &nbsp;i sat in the white vinyl chair facing the sofa and then felt like i couldn't look around the room because i was facing the wall. parking: 4/5 starsit's a strip mall, so there is plenty of free parking.recommendation:i'd definitely go back again for lunch. &nbsp;i have a feeling it gets a little crowded in the evening based upon some of the other reviews i've read.
very sexy. &nbsp;purple velvet &amp; white leather fabrics, gray-lined walls, white bar, chandeliers, and strikingly hot and tattooey servers...that's what i'm talking about. &nbsp;little did i know, that this relatively hidden place in glendale would enter into the &quot;top 5&quot; of my &quot;berger knows burgers&quot; list. &nbsp;burgers, salads, pizzas, drafts...yep, life is good. &nbsp;that is, if you even dare to come in.outside, a little down and out...and you might just pass on by and not care to even go in. &nbsp;an older storefront, in fact, the whole little center of shops looks like a an old hacienda on a film set in mexico -- but don't be fooled. &nbsp;it's a trip to a vegas lounge inside. &nbsp;pssst - they close at midnight, too...you can order a burger at 1145pm if you want! &nbsp; plus, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink specials 3pm-6pm.good menu! &nbsp;a lamb burger, 8-10 beef burger choices ($10), veggie burgers, pastrami burger. &nbsp;lots of good options, salads, and the pizzas look like a must-try, too.1. &nbsp;buffalo-style burger ($12) -- a special, 35 day-aged beef (8 oz), brioche bun, buffalo-style sauce (mild), blue cheese, avocado, bacon...whoa baby, that's what i like. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eden-burger-bar-glendale?select=58h2ehvn3ij4jeu95n5yza#xfo5m_bdooowvqmp-mwxua">yelp.com/biz_photos/eden…</a>2. &nbsp;truffle fries ($4) - long, shoestring, tossed in truffle oil. &nbsp;excellent flavor, and really liked the texture...which stayed crisp even 20-30 mins into eating. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eden-burger-bar-glendale?select=58h2ehvn3ij4jeu95n5yza#58h2ehvn3ij4jeu95n5yza">yelp.com/biz_photos/eden…</a>3. &nbsp;onion rings ($4) - absolutely delish. &nbsp;the onion tasted caramelized, soft, easy to bite thru. &nbsp;the batter, not too thin, not too thick -- they're jjjuuuussst right. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eden-burger-bar-glendale?select=58h2ehvn3ij4jeu95n5yza#amfs8nrpzye2uao3vzj_ew">yelp.com/biz_photos/eden…</a>4. &nbsp;macaroons ($6 for 3) - changes daily, but i shared the salted caramel, orange chocolate, and pistachio. &nbsp;their served a bit chilled, so the consistency was a little different for each. &nbsp;tasty morsels, for sure, but best to get direct from a bakery (or bottega louie). will i be back? &nbsp;hell yeah. &nbsp;do i want to try everything on the menu? &nbsp;hell yeah. &nbsp;next up: &quot;firehouse&quot; burger, which is jalapeno everything (jalapeno cheese, jalapeno bacon, etc). &nbsp;berger likes it spicy. &nbsp;speaking of...kerry, waitress/server/bartender/writer/hottie is super fun. &nbsp;she's a temptress. &nbsp;a great looking gal with a personality on steroids. &nbsp;like totally on fire cute. &nbsp;like i need another reason to come to this garden of eden? &nbsp;okay, that would be willow!
i've been here on dates and with coworkers after <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. always been more than <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to eat here! it's so good! a must go! &nbsp;get the truffle fries! share with a friend. &nbsp;all burgers, amazing! i get cravings for this place. go now :)
granville-glendale
i like granville. especially for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and it's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all the time at the bar and at their high tops. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks are reasonable and the shareable menu with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing is excellent. the shareable beet salad is a great beet salad for just $3. other <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> shareables i like include the taco trio, the toasted cheese dippers, and the lettuce cups. outside of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, granville has great burgers and a very nice lobster bisque. everything is pretty good. and it's so much easier to get a table or booth here than at cheesecake factory, also at americana glendale. never experienced a negative here.
they food here is so fresh and on point every time. they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal and check in offers too.
great food, great service, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a must from 4pm - &nbsp;7pm. their taco trio is delightful!
you can't beat the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at this place! &nbsp;from 4pm to close there are discounts on shareables, martini's, wine and beer. &nbsp;the food is good, not traditional crappy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food and the drink selection for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is stellar.i like the atmosphere which has some nice lighting and deep wood furniture that gives a richness to the place.we went last night and was very pleased with the bartender who served up some solid drinks and conversation. &nbsp;for food and drink favorites, i'm a big fan of the sweet potato fries, the butternut squash soup, the organic vodka martini, and the basil martini. &nbsp;this place is definitely worth a stop on the la <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tour :).
good food and nice ambiance in a prime location. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are phenomenal, as well.
loved the chocolate cake!!! yummy! great patio seating on a warm winter night! great service. nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with coworkers. food was average but healthy. i would return more for the dessert than the food.
i am a granville fan! &nbsp;love the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, the food, the drinks, the location, the staff...always an amazing experience. &nbsp;the mac and cheese is ridic! &nbsp;seriously, soooo amazing. &nbsp;i love how you can get a discount on it during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;just about everything i have ordered here, i adored. &nbsp;i love that they use local farm fresh ingredients and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. &nbsp;do you like sweet potato fries? &nbsp;this is my go to for them.once i have this baby, i will return for a glorious <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
yummy drinks! the small plates are perfect to share like tapas. the food was very tasty as well. stop on by for a late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
this place has great quality food. &nbsp;i had a gaucho salad with beef and it was delicious the chimichurri dressing was one of the best i've ever had. they also have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials!
come here about once a week for dinner. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices at the bar and on the patio. the sangria is yummy and the caprese sandwich is amazing and vegetarian friendly!
my friend gave me a gift card to granville cafe some time ago and i just recently got to check it out. i'm a huge fan of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. any restaurant with any variation of an old fashioned gets automatic points from me. great bar menu, btw. i came here to watch a football game during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they have a pretty solid menu across the board. enjoy!
granville cafe is my favorite restaurant/bar at the americana. &nbsp;great food, and even better cocktails and drinks. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great. a lot of options. &nbsp;the old fashioned is my go to drink.
nice place, food was good and the cucumber martinis are very tasty. the menu was very limited but i was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with my choice of salmon and salad. fresh ingredients and perfectly grilled salmon. service was great. we did not like the fact that there was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only at the bar.
excellent grilled turkey club!!! yummy!!! good portions go very well with their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. the grilled cheese dippers are fabulous! found this place by mistake and loved it!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in effect (4-close sun-thurs)!might as well get another round notice there ain't nothing in your cup &nbsp;so get here baby let me fill it up, fill it up &nbsp;********************************open wide, open wide i know your thirsty, i know your thirstysay aah (aah, aah, aah, aah) &nbsp;patron was not my nigga tonight, but bacardi was. made me want to grrrowl like a tiger. mai tais ($6) in pint glasses. now that's what i call <span class="highlighted">happy</span>! minus one star for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food menu. yes, my super cheesy asada quesadilla was tasty... but at $9 was not a considerable <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> steal. meh, order another round and i'll get over it!* note: i'm blaming this review on the liquor.
i've been there twice and it's still good.good for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>/hang out or larger parties (7-10)...not too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about their variety of brews and cocktails but they have really good house hummus and mac&amp;cheese. &nbsp;pretty much all of their appetizers are good. i suggest going during <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> and ordering a few appetizers and share with date/friends.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review!<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is only at the bar &amp; patio of this rather large restaurant. it appeared that other customers didn't care for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or didn't know of it since only a couple of singles sat at the bar and it was a good <span class="highlighted">hour</span> before another person joined us on the patio.our server gave us the largest <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu that i may have ever seen. &nbsp;for cocktails, we had a stella ($3) and the kenwood cabernet ($5). the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food is listed as &quot;gourmet shareables&quot; so we split the sweet potato fries ($3.95) and grilled cheese dipper ($4.99). the grilled cheese dipper was unlike any grilled cheese i had ever had and i liked it! the sandwich is made on country style bread with gruyere and parmesan cheeses melted with deli mustard and caramelized onions, plus a side of tomato bisque for dipping. the sweet potato fries were served with three dipping sauces - ketchup, garlic aioli, &amp; homemade blue cheese dressing. i'm not usually a fan of blue cheese dressing, but this one was pretty outstanding.granville caf&eacute; is a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> stop after a shopping spree. however, with its location, i think the weekday only <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the reason it was so mellow on my visit. if people aren't shopping or seeing a movie, they may not be as likely to go out of their way to stop in. trust me; the food and drink are worth it.
if you're doomed to the false facades of the americana, you can take some refuge at granville. the food is good quality but unremarkable, but the drink list shines. a perfect sazerac at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. i'll take too.
great place to catch for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> the staff is super friendly and the manager branden is awesome super helpful and funny i will be coming here more often
grilled cheese dipper and the spring chicken salad are 5 stars in my book. small but decent wine list and with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> it was only $7 for a glass! friendly and fast service. i'm at the americana a lot and i pumped i found a place with great affordable food.

came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the pricing was pretty good, but the service was just okay. i don't imagine i'll be coming back, but it was okay for what it was. there are a lot of options in the area, don't feel stuck at this place if you get bored.
* great / friendly service* good food * great deals* homemade chips are good! we came for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and got an appetizer, a pizza, and a burger for $18!how?! you might ask... we got here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and there appetizers are $3 off and we used (and you can re-use) there yelp deal. which is a free entree with a purchase of another entree! the staff was very accommodating and friendly! &nbsp;other reviews said the service was bad and i was hesitant to come here but they must have read those reviews and changed it up because now they are on top of it. and the food was just as great! we got vegetarian friendly meals and it was good. the homemade chips were awesome.
we've been here several times; the food and service have always been superb. &nbsp;if you want to save a few bucks, come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>; the drinks are a few bucks cheaper.
the food here is pretty good, healthy. &nbsp;i felt that the place was a little darker than it should be, but it was nice. &nbsp;i came for some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...the food portions are pretty big, and the sweet potato fries are good!the service could be better, but was ok enough for me to overlook it.i will be back to try more things on the menu.
been here a couple times for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. their hh menu is pretty nice and high quality. their fries are the best, and their drinks are pretty unique. servers here are a bit snobby though.. we even heard one of them openly argue with the manager and then throw fit after in the bartending area. definitely killed the mood a bit.
granville is a great place for breakfast, dinner, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;have not been for lunch. have only gone for breakfast in burbank, as breakfast in glendale does not start until 10am (burbank starts at 9). for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, it'snot as lively as burbank but a good deal - drinks are $3 off and apps are $2 off m-f. &nbsp;dinner is very good as well, esp the ahi tuna, pork chop, and salmon dishes. &nbsp;it's a casual cafe with solid food ,good service, and decent prices. the burbank location is better, in my opinion. &nbsp;i think it might be that the crowd from the americana a block away makes it feel more touristy and the servers are not as attentive.parking - metered or free garage parking and residential street parking nearby
i love the black &amp; bleu burger they serve here, perfectly cooked and full of flavor! &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials are also very good with discounts on beer and cocktails as well as the appetizers.a good place to watch the game and kick back, or to enjoy a quick lunch with a friend.
the drinks and food are both original and delicious.. and pretty great deals, with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the free yelp check in entree. we'll definitely be back!the menu is quite varied, which i love. &nbsp;they have great soups, salads and entrees, which can be hard to find in one place.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is awesome! &nbsp;half off starters which is like $3 for lemon couscous and beet salad. &nbsp;burgers were decent and sweet potato fries were good. &nbsp;not super crunchy but addictive for some reason. &nbsp;they like using a twig of rosemary as garnish.brunch looks good, will try.park in the americana parking lot and remember to get your validation! &nbsp;go for a walk shopping to burn those calories afterwards.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a truly glorious occasion at this joint. &nbsp;the drinks are a perfect way to start an evening post-work/stress/whatever etc. &nbsp;the zen martini is absolutely divine. &nbsp;they have a great beer selection and food tv is playing constantly. &nbsp;most of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> apps are delish. &nbsp;you can't leave without trying the sweet potato fries or the lettuce cups. &nbsp;i know it sounds so pf chang, but the lettuce cups are really just a salad in 3 bites. &nbsp;sometimes service is a little spotty, but the food makes up for it. &nbsp;the thai salad and mac and cheese are a must.
consistently five star service both on and off the bar with adria - normally we sit at the bar and have brunch, but tonight we found our selves at dinner <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> -
service is always great. &nbsp;nice outdoor sitting. fresh gourmet food. the pan-seared ahi sandwich is amazing! fresh cuts of seared ahi with a wasabi aioli. yum! great place for casual date night or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with friends.
we decided to stop by on a busy sunday at the americana at 4:30 and the place was practically empty. was disappointed to find out that despite the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sign posted, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was only for weekdays, starting at 4 pm. i decided to get the famous mac and cheese, and my friend got a soup and salad. the mac and cheese is delicious, but not up to the hype around it (but, what is?). highlight of the meal was my cocktail, the ginger julep. her salad and soup were also passable. service was indifferent, as most of the waiters were standing around at the bar chatting, but friendly.  i would go again, but only because most of the restaurants at the americana are so uneven in quality.
i've been to this restaurant more times than i can count and every single dish has always been delicious. but, if i could sell my soul to have their grilled cheese and tomato bisque every single day....&quot;where do i sign?&quot; &nbsp;oh and it's part of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu! hellllllll to the yesthe best/worth every cent dishes include: grilled cheese dipperuptown mac &amp; cheeseel gaucho saladspicy chicken pastaskirt steaksouthwest burgerall fish dishesall solid choices. portions are large, making the prices reasonable. atmosphere is romantic and service is always awesome! it's located right next to the americana so you can work off the massive meal with some retail exercise!
for a restaurant in glendale this place is incredible! it's one of my favorite lunch spots but it still makes a great date night too, oh and did i mention <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>?! they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. everything at the restaurant is organic and freshly made in the kitchen, nothing frozen here folks! truthfully, i have never tried a dish here that i haven't liked, however the uptown mac and cheese has to be my favorite! seriously, go to this restaurant, and try every dish- you will not regret it! it has a cool, casual ambiance and its quiet enough to have a conversation, but they also have flatscreens mounted all over so... you don't have to miss the game. the service is usually friendly and prompt and the prices are quite fair for how delicious everything is- so good, you won't believe you're in glendale!
macaroni and cheese you ask? do it!oh, you're having breakfast? that &quot;everything but the kitchen sink omelette&quot; looks good? do it!oh, you're here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and can't decide on a cocktail? place your finger on the menu drag it around for a bit and pick the drink your finger lands on! joking aside i've had the pleasure to experience all subsets of this places dining service and every single time i've never been let down with anything, so give it a go and trust your instincts, just do it!
i really enjoyed this place! i was meeting up friends and had no clue what to expect. it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the deals were great, $3 off martinis and cocktails being the one i was the one that i was most interested in. i got a tipsy lemonade martini and the drink was huge and only $6 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i also got the seared ahi. my friend got a taco appetizer where you can pick three of four options from salmon, chicken, beef, and shrimp. my ahi was delicious and my friend had downed his tacos in just a few minutes, gushing the whole time how great they were. our service was great too! the waitress was always checking up on us and had great recommendations. i will definitely be going again!
on this 60 degree cali day in february, our after work destination needs lead us to granville. if you're looking for a great cocktail paired with amazing ambience, this is your place. the staff were very accommodating and knew their menu, well! that is something that i always look out for, because there's nothing worse than a person who does not eat or drink what they serve. we elected to sit in the inside &quot;outside&quot; patio. who would think you could do that in feb. ? well, they even had a nice heater going to make sure you didn't get too chilly. we happened to make it there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> where there were discounted martinis and appetizers. we had the pizza, &amp; lettuce wraps. my friend had a phenomenal melbac and i had a beautifully crafted cucumber martini. refreshing, doesn't even explain its degree of perfection. again great place. excellent atmosphere. great service. good prices during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. if i could give them a 4 1/2 i would, and it is only because i am comparing it to places that i've been to in chicago. try it for you self and don't forget to check in for a free app.
this restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat in glendale. nice ambiance, great food, good prices, and organic ingredients. they have a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu too. their ahi tuna sharable dish is my favorite there. i've always had great customer service too. everyone needs to try this place!
gourmet grilled cheese - buttery grilled toast with melted gruyere plus they give you a little cup of tomato bisque to dip this amazing grilled cheese into. &nbsp;huge fan of this dish!!martinis come with freshly stuffed blue cheese olives - another magnificent idea!! &nbsp;the waitress said they all have to help with stuffing olives hahaha.taco trio was really tasty too.they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and its actually a very good deal but if you can't catch that go for lunch or dinner still. &nbsp;everything is very fresh and i think they said organic too... don't quote me on the organic thing not 100% sure. &nbsp;but def worth stopping in for some casual dining/lunching/<span class="highlighted">happy houring</span> with friends. &nbsp;good portions and very tasty food!
this is your most healthful option at the americana brand. &nbsp; i love the santa barbara chicken with pesto aioli, with a salad. &nbsp;my friend enjoyed her roasted beet salad and minestrone soup.great salad options. &nbsp;turkey cranberry my favorite. &nbsp;taken out of town guests here for brunch, they've always been <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. &nbsp;met friends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> shareables, the sweet potato fries w/ranch dressing are always a hit. &nbsp; &nbsp;avocado melt and burger tasty as well.
eh.... thats pretty much my overall feeling about this place. i will say that they let us use the yelp special offer with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which was nice, but everything else was just ok. the food was good, but the bread on the sandwiches was kind of dry, stale almost.... and the tuna in the shareable was also mediocre. if you are gonna serve seared ahi tuna, it should be good tuna.the drinks were also eh, even at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices they were still a bit expensive and they were very sweet. i found myself searching for the alcohol in my drink. i should have stuck with beer like my boyfriend. i guess this place has 4 stars because everything else in americana is so lame but i wouldn't waste my money again...the chips are good! &nbsp;probably the only thing that makes this a 3
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until close. great drinks with creative flavors. the zentini is good. berry lemonade is disappointing because it's just sour lemonade with a few bluberries and a cut up strawberry in it. not that great. but the chicken and steak is good. mashed potatoes are okay. sweet potato fries are topped with rosemary, and it's very fragrant.uptown mac and cheese is great! very rich, and you feel full after a few bites. the chocolate cake is not good. save dessert for someplace else. service and ambience: nice and comfortable.
whenever i have time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i always find my way to hit up granville and get something to drink and munch on. for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, they have a variety of their cocktails and shareables $3 off, beer and wine $2 off. i always love the ambiance at granville for several reasons. first and foremost, granville has that classy feel with the tables, the high chairs, everything! even the lighted ceiling looked like a fancy beehive in a nice way. i always enjoyed looking around at the lighting to see how dimly lighted it was. it just brings out that intimate vibe for either two or a small group of people. between my boyfriend and i, we each got our own cocktails and shared the uptown mac and cheese, which was creamy on the inside and crunchy on the outside - just the way &nbsp;i like it. service took a while to get our attention. i remember we were sitting in the bar for at least ten minutes (we were done figuring out what to order, mind you). we then saw a guy walked in, got seated next to us, and the bartender immediately asked for his order. he got to us next, but i just find it interesting that it took him that long to get our attention. nevertheless, the rest of the service was great. for parking, you can park at the americana and get your ticket validated for 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of free parking, which is a must whenever you want to walk around at the americana anyway and get some grub while you are at it. plus, check in at yelp for some free sweet potato fries.overall, give granville a try if you desire for some gourmet <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food and drinks for an affordable price!
solid gastropub with good selection of locally grown, organic ingredients and variations to suit most tastes. the veggie burger was one of the best i've enjoyed. service was great, our waitstaff was chirpy, upbeat and good humoured. hard to beat a sincere smile and great attitude to make your dining experience all the better. when i'm back in the area, i'll need to partake in the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the prices were great and my party greatly enjoyed the concoctions.
if you like cheesecake factory, you'll loooovvee granville. in essence they offer the same style food and menu options, the major difference is granville is organic. yes, organic. scoring major brownie points for a health concious consumer, like myself. other reason to love granville?awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> monday-thursday from 4-close! great food and good prices.
def. come here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i believe it's mon-fri 4pm-7pm. the mac n cheese is only $8 (originally $15!!) and the sweet potato fries are only $4 (originally $8). i must say their mac n cheese changed a lil. last time there was no cheddar added to it, which in my preference was much better. other than that, service was excellent, got seated right away and enjoyed some cheap cocktails!
i recently tried granville cafe for the first time during restaurant week, and was really impressed! my food was delicious, and the restaurant week prices were amazing. i went with some co-workers and we caught the tail end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which made our cocktails reasonable. we were all sort of expecting smaller portions of their appetizers, entrees and desserts, but instead it was full sized portions, and a ton of food. everything was delicious, and our waiter was attentive and friendly. i'll definitely be back for lunch sometime.
came here on a friday and was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> when i learned i still had 15 minutes to catch their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! was seated at the bar immediately and had the pleasure of being served by joel. &nbsp;he was very kind and helpful throughout our meal. &nbsp;since it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, we decided to take advantage of the appetizers and &quot;small bites&quot;. &nbsp;we ordered the taco trio (steak, chicken, and shrimp--shrimp being the most flavorful, whereas the others were quite bland but still good), the mac and cheese, and the sweet potato fries. &nbsp;the mac and cheese was definitely not what i had expected. &nbsp;instead of being an individual appetizer size, it was a whole plate of mac and cheese. &nbsp;it tasted more like a pasta dish, so that caught me off guard. &nbsp;the chicken and peas and asparagus in the mac and cheese was a nice touch, but it was overall, a heavy dish and a meal in itself. &nbsp;definitely try the sweet potato fries. &nbsp;i loved them. &nbsp;what made them so great was the dipping sauces. &nbsp;ranch, traditional ketchup, and my favorite--bleu cheese dressing! i loved the fries with the bleu cheese dressing! i'm not a fan of the restaurant choices at the americana, but i think the granville cafe is a great option. &nbsp;i'll definitely come back to try their other dishes and of course have their sweet potato fries again.
stopped in monday for a mid day (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>) refill of food and drink. walking across the courtyard we saw the filming of the far east movement's next music video. didn't realize these are the guys who do like a g6, but the quasi celeb sighting was fun. inside had the lettuce cups (mediocre), the tuna (good), and the mac and cheese (great!). service was good and friendly, and mojitos were fantastic. pretty chill vibe and very comfy chairs.
yummers!came for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, sat at the bar, and stayed for a good 3 <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. the food is clean, fresh, and the atmosphere is formal enough, but not so formal that i felt out of place. it's fine-dining without the pressure.sweet potato fries. so good because of the different sauces. i had the ahi tuna and it was ok. i think i should stick to having raw fish at sushi restaurants. but loves the cheese and tomatos, which made it less... asian :)friend got the mac and cheese. it was creamy, not too salty, and yummmerssss. we had a good 3 drinks per person. ahaha it's not the cheapest place, but gooood deal for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the drinks are really yummy, not overly alcohol-tasting, but not too sweet.love the atmosphere, love how chill it is, love how people aren't all up in your grill, and it's clean. fresh. fresh. fresh. oh and everything is made out of organic ingredients. i don't really care... but it made me feel healthier ;)
stopped by here on a whim last week - and have been wanting to go back since. &nbsp;they do a great job with sourcing local ingredients, making everything from scratch, etc.. &nbsp;great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials too, for both food and drink. &nbsp;i'm a vegetarian and my fiance isn't... frequently places will have a lot to offer for one of us (ok, usually him) and not the other... but granville had interesting, tasty options for both of us. &nbsp;yay granville!
what a fun outing location! &nbsp;we went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and we all had a great time. &nbsp;they serve hefty shots and i was amazed by their fries. &nbsp;i'm not a big fan for fries (i know...how could i not be a fries lover...), but granville's fries were sooo good. &nbsp;we ordered regular fries and sweet potato fries, and even though sweet potato fries are usually the more popular item, granville's fries were the obvious winner at our table. &nbsp;our server was so attentive too. &nbsp;definitely will be back! &nbsp;it's right outside the americana, so go check it out after a long day of shopping!
i love this place. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, dinner, lunch, whenever... it's great. i love sitting outside when it's not freezing. the service is great. this is only a few blocks from our house so we walk over to have dinner about once a month. granville has delicious american bistro fare without the crazy crowd like cheesecake factory. my daughter loves their uptown mac &amp; cheese. i don't eat meat but she thinks it's the best mac &amp; cheese ever. she's 11 but has a very mature palate, she has to always have some of my seared tuna which is really good. soups and salads are super yummy too. definitely a good place for families, friends, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, dinner and cocktails, etc. i normally meet friends here if they're in the area. no one is ever disappointed.
this place is absolutely perfect for a pre-movie dinner at the americana. my boyfriend and i have been here twice and have enjoyed the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and drinks. the pineapple margarita is my favorite - a little bit of smokiness and a huge wedge of fresh, juicy pineapple on the glass make it a winner! boyfriend has had two different drinks which he's enjoyed as well. the small plates are perfect to share and make a delicious dinner. certain dishes stick out as being especially good: the grilled cheese dippers with tomato soup (<a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2foh.my&amp;s=276e2ebc350073d2f8621da53e522ee7e0b3af05e71440977ab5e373881b8943" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">oh.my</a>.god.), the uptown mac-and-cheese (very filling - beware!), and boyfriend absolutely loved his chicken tacos. as for the service, the waitresses are incredibly sweet and attentive, despite the crowds around dinner time! prices: wonderful, especially for two semi-broke college students like the boyfriend and myself. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is key. i can't even remember what the deals are, but you can get a full meal and two drinks (each) for two people for about $40. awesome in my book!ambiance: nice! even though we usually sit up on a high bar-like table, we're pretty secluded from other guests and have our privacy. it's definitely a cool place.go!
still one of my favorite places! every meal i've ever had here is super delicious and consistent. depending on time you come, it can take quite a bit for your food to come (pretty normal) but when it comes it doesn't disappoint! although they don't &quot;recommend&quot; substitutions, they've always been cool with me doing a small substitution here and there. now that i can drink, i really enjoy their specialty cocktails especially their mojitos. they also have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with $3 off of their drinks and appetizers which i love.
granville cafe was delicious. &nbsp;my date and i got there around 4:30pm (really early dinner) and luckily we caught <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! (4-7pm i believe)the place is located right next to americana, so you know it's gonna be nice and new inside and out. &nbsp;the hostess was nice and explained to us how <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> worked. &nbsp;servers/waitress was nice, friendly, and very helpful. for drinks, we ordered a strawberry mojito and another called the village idiot. &nbsp;strawberry mojito was really sweet (eh at best) and the village idiot was just like a long island. &nbsp;both priced at $6 for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;not too bad. &nbsp;for food, we ordered uptown mac n cheese and sweet potato fries. &nbsp;the mac n cheese is good! &nbsp;they have those big elbowed pastas that contain a lot of the flavor, chunks of chicken, and asparagus. &nbsp;it's an interesting combination for mac n cheese, but it works. &nbsp;we probably could have made a light meal out of just the mac n cheese. &nbsp;the sweet potato fries are must-haves! &nbsp;light and crispy and delicious. &nbsp;super tasty! &nbsp;we also ordered chipotle chicken club sandwich and the village burger with fried onions strings. &nbsp;the sandwich is decent - avocado, bacon, chicken on ciabatta is yummy. &nbsp;the burger was okay as well - juicy with a good garlic aioli sauce. &nbsp;it came with potato chips that they fry and those are delicious! &nbsp;very addicting and fried well.overall the place is good. &nbsp;the atmosphere is nice (they dim the lights - good for romantic dates as well as a regular hang out). &nbsp;the workers are cool. &nbsp;food-wise, i think my favorite items were the sides (fries, chips, and mac n cheese). &nbsp;after all that we ordered, the price came out to be about $60. &nbsp;kinda pricey, but the quality is good. &nbsp;i will probably come back for mac n cheese + sp fries soon.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and they offer three dollars off appetizers. &nbsp;we started off with mac and cheese (must order) and seared ahi tuna. &nbsp;for our entree we got the chicken marsala and they were nice enough to split the plate for us. &nbsp;we would definitely come back and try out the other items. &nbsp;parking would be at the americana.
kate f. and i come here for lunch at least once a month. &nbsp;we roll ourselves out after eating way too much yummy food. &nbsp;this is a great brunch and lunch spot. &nbsp;nice outside dining area but is kind of small. &nbsp;inside seating is way bigger and usually there's no wait. &nbsp;i've never had anything that was bad, but the only thing that was bland was their chicken caesar salad. &nbsp;apparently, they have a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too. &nbsp;or so i've heard, i've yet to experience that...yummy must have's:- sweet potato fries- grilled cheese dipper- thai salad- turkey club sandwich- chocolate pancakes- french toast- berry lemonade
i wasn't necessarily expecting a lot from this place, but i was pleasantly surprised! great burgers, and their sweet potato fries are amazing (plus we got a free order with our yelp check-in!). granted, we got take out, so i can't speak to their service or other things people commented on. but for the price point, and being a little cafe outside the americana, i think it's just fine &nbsp;:) &nbsp; maybe not where i would go for a fine dining experience necessarily, but definitely for solid burgers or a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> type experience.
a surprising find if you're in glendale for the first time ever and have absolutely no clue where to dine! it's classic american food with some nice sandwich and pasta options. though we didn't try them, granville also has massive steak, chicken and pork chop entrees. also, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 5-7 pm (strictly enforced) with some enticing discounts on beer and wine.top tip: seems to be a good place for groups of 6 or more.
i have eaten at granville cafe for brunch, lunch and dinner. &nbsp;the food is great. &nbsp;the prices are reasonable and the service is stellar. &nbsp;if you want a casual dining experience with fresh food, a full bar and great service stop by and try the food. &nbsp;they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the grilled cheese dippers are wonderful. &nbsp;i celebrated my birthday here earlier this year and the staff was attentive and everyone really enjoyed their brunch.
this is a cute cafe with great food. everything i've had here has been delicious, from the salads to the sandwiches to the soups. my favorite dish here is the granville salad with chicken. it's basically a greek salad with lettuce and the dressing is so delicious! they also have a good tomato bisque and pastrami sandwich. service is always friendly and they have a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in the bar area.
4 stars for service3-4 stars for food (been here 1x only)food:<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: $2-3 off select drinks and several &quot;shareable&quot; itemsmac n' cheese- i love mac n' cheese and even better when it comes with asparagus and peas. but there was a lot more gruyere than cheddar cheese so it tasted a bit bland. i like my mac n' cheese with that sharp cheese flavor. turkey blt- my husband and i both thought the turkey was a lost more moist than it would be, but nothing extraordinary.
came here for girls night out and got great service &amp; great food!the bartender was so sweet and friendly and very attentive and they make an awesome gran cosmo! &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at the bar makes these drinks only $6!they knew i was waiting for friends and saved a booth for us...love that!the butternut squash soup is a-mazing! &nbsp;and we all had the grilled asparagus side which is soooo yummy!the decor in the room to the left is not as nice, so ask for a booth on the bar side for more ambience.great food &amp; great service!
i had another great server; super nice and sociable. i had the taco trio; that was so goood!!! i particularly loooved the steak//beef taco. the caramelized onions and the sauce they used for it was amazing. the chicken with the mango was good (the mango was so tasty) and the shrimp one was decent. make sure you go during the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (discounted small plates//appetizers and alcoholic beverages) but some servers may require you to sit at the patio for this discount (i think...)
don't you love it when you stumble across a place you have never heard of, found an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> then find their food is fabulous? i know, i do too.so i first tried their traditional mojito and it was good, then tried this drink called havana which is a cuban mojito and it was even better. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu also turned out to be more than just ordinary bar food. i am not a crazy mac and cheese fan but their mac &amp; cheese with peas, asparagus and baked topping is absolutely delicious. sounds weird but you will be surprised. also try the trio tacos, no shortage of flavor here and extremely fresh ingredients. they use organic ingredients and make all their food fresh daily so it doesnt taste like it has been sitting or just heated. speaking to the manager i was told to try the thick-cut pork chop next time i come in. that might be sooner than later!great date spot, for groups, or even solo.
came here on the suggestion of fellow yelpers after watching a conan tv taping!came right before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended and ordered the following:thai ginger salad with salmon - on the menu, it states that they use the freshest ingredients (and when asked about the fish, the waiter stated they use sushi-grade fish) &nbsp;i decided to order this salad with the salmon only seared. &nbsp;it was a worthy choice. &nbsp;the salmon was buttery, sweet, and overall very delicious. &nbsp;it melted perfectly with the thai ginger salad dressing and made for a delicious salad altogether.lemon seared ahi - the ahi here was also very fresh and flavorful. &nbsp;ordered as an appetizer and i personally love seared ahi so i get it everywhere i go. this place definitely did not disappoint.uptown mac n cheese- every review i read stated that this dish was huge. &nbsp;the girlfriend and i ordered the appetizer portion to share and did not even get close to finishing it. &nbsp;it was quite hearty with chunks of chicken and breadcrumbs but was very very delicious. &nbsp;definitely a dish to try when you come here.overall, the restaurant had a nice ambiance, small crowd, and nice staff. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is also a plus.
i was out near glendale two weeks ago and decided to try granville for dine la. while i was a little bummed they were out of their fish entree, the rest of the meal was great. the waiter was very attentive and personable. &nbsp;you could tell he took pride in his work and wanted to ensure we had a great meal. &nbsp;the place has a very comfortable set up with spacious booths and a large circular bar in the center, which gave me the feel that this place is designed to cater a large <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> crowd. in terms of the food:the chipotle chicken was very satisfying. it is really not a spicy sandwich as the name might suggest, but the whole sandwich was well put together. the mac and cheese was delicious!the side salad was also really well made (unfortunately i forgot the name for this review)the angel hair pasta was very well made, but pasta itself rarely wows me. worth a try if you are in the area!
delicious food! service could be a bit more attentive but overall it is a good dining experience. i have been to this location 3 times. first, i went for <span class="highlighted">happy</span> hour.their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> selection applies to all &quot;shareables&quot; which are their appetizers as well as beer, wine, and cocktails. the second and third time i ate here i sat outside on the patio. on a beautiful southern california night this is a must! enjoy a delicious cocktail (maybe the picante pineapple margarita--yummy!) or a lagunitas ipa with sweet potatoes fries and entree of your choice. you will not be disappointed!
food - chili with added chicken has a simple heart flavor, a great texture with the beans and &quot;crunchy veggies&quot;, and is large enough for two. five star foodie chili. order the sweet potato fries for appetizer. they come with a great aoli but the fries taste good a bough by themselves.service - extremely prompt. i didn't wait more than 15 minutes for my food. my drink took a minute.drinks - has a unique twist on traditional cocktails with a sweet/non sweet collection. the american cocktail is less sweet than a fruit mojito or passion fruit drink. it's also made with shaved ice. it doesn't go away! genius to serve this with shaved ice. great drink.atmosphere - upscale, open, busy on a saturday at dinner time. have one tv with a game on. overall great for families or <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>.price- &nbsp;would be easily 40 per person in downtown la, but prices lower. very reasonable. side of fries $5 and chili bowl $9. cocktails as always raise the bill and are $10... adding chicken to the chili was a +4. but the service, food, and atmosphere were worth it.
i would rather give this place a 3.5 but i'll round up. &nbsp;the place is a pretty cool spot with a decent sized bar area. &nbsp;i would like to check out the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here but for my first time i came here with a date on a thursday night. &nbsp;out of all the dishes that we ordered my favorites were the butter nut squash soup, mac and cheese, and the banana sundae.i also had the granville salad, tomato soup and pan seared lemon ahi which i thought were just ok.service was spot on and i was definitely satisfied after my meal.
this place is amazing... the ambience, the food, the location, the waiters.. just amazing.the gourmet grilled cheese dipper was made of various cheeses with caramelized onions between two crusty parmesan cheese bread. to accompany this delicious sandwich was a creamy, rich tomato bisque... dare i say more?also had the santa barbara chicken sandwich. the combination of juicy chicken breast topped with smoked mozzarella, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, and basil pesto on ciabatta bread was yum! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here was not too bad either. discounts on select drinks and shareable athe service and waiters were behind wonderful! granville won't do you no wrong. it's a must try!
i had the pleasure of having dinner at this restaurant for the first time tonight. i have a very healthy diet, and found that the menu items and my choice of food (butter lettuce cups and a side salad) were delicious and filling. i had the butter lettuce cups with steak, and it was simply divine and had a very unique taste that i quite enjoyed. i loved the atmosphere and noticed it got quite busy after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was over. my waitress was lovely, charming and very friendly. overall, my first experience was great!
couple good things: went on thursday night where <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was from 4-close, the beer on tap is craft beer, the grilled cheese dipper appetizer was awesome, easy to get a seat at the bar because it was nearly empty.couple bad things: the burger buns look gourmet but are dry, the burger meat is big but lacks flavor, they were out of ipa when we went, everything had rosemary on it (sweet potato fries, chips, and even the burger had a sprig sticking out of it. we get it, you like rosemary), there was nobody in there and our beers glasses sat empty for a while at the desolate bar.
i love love love granville cafe. &nbsp;it's california-style food and everything tastes so fresh and delicious. &nbsp;it's a great place to go for lunch or dinner (fun <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beverages too) - and you can watch sporting events at the bar. &nbsp;the weekend brunch is so-so, but lunch and dinner are highly recommended. &nbsp;i am a vegetarian and love eating here.
during our last visit a few months ago, we had a pretty good time; however, our server was a little bit &quot;off&quot;. &nbsp;we tried granville again on wednesday, 09/24/2014 for dinner. &nbsp;we had a definite 5 star experience.we arrived and were immediately seated inside close to the bar. &nbsp;we had an amazing server! &nbsp;his name was brandon. &nbsp;he was kind, friendly, prompt, was checking on us the appropriate amount of times, and seemed genuinely concerned about our overall experience. &nbsp;loved him.the food was amazing. &nbsp;we were still on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices, so we decided to get one large salad and three shareables for the two of us. &nbsp;well, it was plenty of food. &nbsp;all of the food we had was absolutely amazing, tasted fresh, and was well prepared. &nbsp;absolutely nothing wrong with this visit at all. &nbsp;i am glad we returned.
this is one of my favorite restaurants. it has the perfect blend of intimacy, great food, solid music selection, attentive service, and varied beverage options. i especially liked the uptown mac and cheese. if you're a fan of cheese in any form, you will love this dish. the bacon and blue burger is yummy, but very filling, so prepare yourself.try the sangria. for the love of all that is good and holy in this world, you have to, as it is incredibly tasty. they fill it with a veritable cornucopia of fruit, which serves as a perfect after dinner treat/dessert before you go.the seating isn't great for large groups, as they have limited options for that, but for a date or smaller groups, it works out just fine. it can also be a bit of a wait on weekends as they don't take reservations, so be sure to leave ample time lest you become hangry. (that's hungry+angry for all you non-millenials)overall, the feel of the restaurant is just great. it's a classic california spot, and the ambiance enables you to be completely casual or dress up a bit. parking is easy. you can go the americana route and get it validated, or the galleria parking is just next door and totally free.i would also add that the vibe definitely skews younger, with all the traditional hipster-like pieces (alternative music, dark color scheme, and creative food styles). their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is not bad either!
food: 4.5 starsservice: 3.5 starsi've been coming here for a while and i do enjoy it. i love their butternut squash soup, the soba noodle chicken salad, and the the fig pizza. all are so good. &nbsp;their sweet potato fries are also quite good and i know several people who love their burgers and sandwiches.the service can be hit or miss. sometimes we get amazing servers, sometimes okay servers, and occasionally not very good servers. sometimes the service can be a little slow too, but the food is delicious, so i am always willing to wait a little longer for it.they have great, fun drinks as well, and a pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too. parking is in the americana mall. make sure you get your ticket validated!i definitely like the glendale location over the burbank one.
yas yas yaaas, everything is yas.location/parking: perfect for stopping by for a bite when you're shopping at the americana or glendale galleria. also perfect for avoiding the hustle n bustle of the mall since it's facing out on the perimeter of all the stores and people. parking is also convenient because it's smack in the middle between the galleria parking structure and the americana parking structure. granville also validates for the latter so take your pick :)service: our server was super friendly, but it was kinda hard to grab her attention at times.food: so good! french fries are crazy addicting and i don't even know why because they just regular fries........ but yeah #cantstopwontstop when it comes to the fries. the spicy chicken pasta was really good and came in a huge portion; yay for leftovers when you ballin on a budget. speaking of budget, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! weekdays from 4-7 i believe..$3 off cocktails and $2 off beers and wines!yaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssss
i was looking forward to coming here since it had so many reviews and i haven't been to the americana in a few years. &nbsp;i sat at the bar table area while waiting for my client to area and was pleased to see that they had a few dollars off for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i ordered the scrimshaw and the server recommended the uptown mac and cheese and sweet potato fries indicating that they were popular choices. &nbsp;i agree that the sweet potato fries were good but the mac and cheese at $10 (reg $13) was just ok. &nbsp;i didn't think that it had much flavor and the noodles were a bit soft. &nbsp;it all just tasted mushy. &nbsp;we shared the thai ginger salad with chicken and while the salad itself lacked flavor, the chicken was very moist and tasty.
been to burbank location and enjoy it.visited glendale location and loved it too. the decor is real nice but not stuffy. this location seems somehow better, although wish it had more direct access to americana.i agree with other review..frida left me flat..too much money for not so awsome mexican food. but a+ location.i had the chicken/blue cheese/fig pizza..it is sooo good!had the berry patch mojito and that was great too..may be a bit sweet for some but great for me..had 3!prices are reasonable and service is great. i have to go try the patio in the evening..looks like it would be good place for a few drinks.i like that their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is not only the well drinks but includes a discount on top shelf drinks too.
i came to granville for dinner on a tuesday night with a friend. the restaurant wasn't very busy, and there were many open seats. we made it just in time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which basically is a few bucks off an alcoholic beverage. we check in on yelp and got the free side of sweet potato fries, which were delicious! very well-seasoned, would definitely recommend getting them. i decided to try the uptown mac since it was well reviewed on yelp. to be honest, i wasn't too impressed. i got a bit full from the fries so i could only eat about half of the plate. the mac &amp; cheese was a little bland in my opinion, the pieces of chicken helped the dish out (brought some salt to the taste buds). compared to other mac &amp; cheese places i have had, this plate was mediocre. my friend went with the pork chop. it was very very tender (chewy almost), and very good. the cooked spinach and mashed potatoes on the plate were good as well. this was a quite a filling plate, decently priced for its portion.overall service was nice and consistent. remember to validate parking if you are parking in the american structure!
came here with the family on monday night. i have been to the burbank location before and loved it. it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and our server never explained that to us. we had to figure it out on our own and when we asked a question regarding it he acted like i was bothering him . any way's i ordered a burger that was cold in the center. so they must re-heat. i didn't bother to say anything just because they know that is has been re-heated and need to make sure it was warmed up completely. i'll go back to the burbank location &nbsp;next time. much more friendly staff.
definitely a fan!! i really like how its all organic and the food is prepared daily to ensure freshness. oh and they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4pm-close!...lets me start by saying that the drinks are really good here. they have great bartenders who prepare your drinks perfectly delicious. the beer is great here too. they're appetizers are the best. the artisan pizza and grilled cheese dippers are so savory and yummy.the salads are very fresh, crisp, and delicious. they are no ordinary salads, they def have a twist to them.the sandwiches are some of the best ive had ever. you cant go wrong with anything on the menu but if you're unsure as to what to order you can always ask your server.i also really enjoyed how friendly and polite the waiters are. i have had great service each time.
wow, so delicious! the menu has a lot of variety, vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options on top of the meat and fish. we had the five artisan cheese pizza, which was incredibly fresh, with high quality cheese. also the lemon cous cous, which was light and perfectly cooked, the roasted beats, also light and perfectly done, best beats we've ever had. the ahi tuna fillet with noodles was cooked rare, excellently quality. also the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> made this huge, high quality meal affordable. great service, great drink selection.
i've been to both this granville cafe and the one in burbank. &nbsp;the food here is amazing! &nbsp;i love the mac and cheese! &nbsp; the wait staff is very nice and attentive.this location is conveniently located next to the americana and they have good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials -half priced apps!also the sweet potato fries are to die for. &nbsp;my husband and i order them as our app every time we go there. &nbsp;the only criticism i have is that i went here (twice) when i was almost 9 months pregnant and the greeter wanted to sit our party in the booth - both times! &nbsp;not very much room for me and my bump. &nbsp;so we moved ourselves to a table and were much happier.
great restaurant located just outside of americana. they have a great patio area if you want to take your food outside on a nice day to eat your delicious meal and people watch. i was first introduced by a friend to this place because of the great deal they give to their fellow yelpers! free entree for up to like $15 with the purchase of 2 beverages (just get soda!). i wanted to try their house special lemonade and it was &quot;eh&quot;, it's basically your regular lemonade and they add a couple of berries and a slice of strawberry, nothing fancy about it. their seared ahi sandwich is pretty darn tasty along with their mac n cheese. service is great and they have a mini bar located right behind the greeters as well if you want to join for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.overall, cute place with decent prices if you get tired of going to the cheescake factory or kat-suya in americana.
great place!!service:i always have great service here: including a nice greeting from the hostess and great service from the waiters. so good that our appetizer came out after our entree and the manager came by to tell us that it would be taken off the bill.drinks:they make good drinks but they aren't very strong, even martinis so go for either wine, beer, or a straight up martini.food:i love their food it is very fresh and tasteful. love the taco trio (1 with shrimp, steak, and chicken) which i get for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> frequently:shrimp was greatchicken was fantastic with mango and avocadosteak: kind of bbq flavor so i usually get 2 chicken.
we tried this spot as a recommendation from one of our friends. we went on a friday evening and the place is visually stunning. the wood beams, the open kitchen and the patio area are all eye candy. however, the food was average. luckily, we came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so our early dinner was a little less expensive. we tried the bacon &amp; bleu burger, the blta sandwich and some mac &amp; cheese. the burger was okay, the blta was mediocre, but surprisingly the mac &amp; cheese was the hit. we ordered some glasses of sangria as well, and those were decent. this place is great to have a drink or two, but the food was just okay. nothing out of the ordinary. the service was friendly, the ambiance is great and make sure to check in on yelp for a great deal.
this place has really good food, a diverse american menu that includes great salads, sandwiches and entrees, and nice ambiance with a bar, outside patio, and dining area.i've eaten here twice, both times either before or after a movie at americana. &nbsp;i once ate at the bar and once in the dining room. &nbsp;both times i was very <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the food and service. &nbsp;at the bar they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - which lasts almost all night (till 10 or 11 i think) - and includes discounted appetizers and drinks (cocktails, wine and beer). &nbsp;their rib eye sandwich came on ciabatta bread and was topped with caramelized onions, blue cheese, organic arugula, horseradish aioli and garlic aioli - it was awesome.great choice for a solid, reasonably priced dinner when visiting the galleria/americana area.
so i went to the opening of americana last night and decided to try the granville cafe! &nbsp;it was great! &nbsp;the wait would have been an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>, but luckily we found a table in the bar area. &nbsp;my bf and i ordered the uptown mac &amp; cheese, sweet potato fries, a pitcher of sangria, and a thai salad with steak on top. &nbsp;all of it was delicious. &nbsp;my favorite was definitely the sweet potato fries and the mac &amp; cheese dish. &nbsp;our waitress and bus boys were super nice and were even chatting with us and other customers, making it a very welcoming and chill atmosphere. &nbsp;i want to try their other burbank location, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and weekend breakfasts next. &nbsp;i would definitely come again and again. &nbsp;just be wary that the parking is horrendous right now with americana's grand opening.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, specifically to try out their sangria which was mighty tasty! but...prices were still too high for the amount of food you get.taco trio- 3 tiny tacos for $9 hh, huge flavor but i was still hungry which led me to order ...cheese quesadilla- $6 hh; i guess i didn't read the description well enough. it was filled with a ton of veggies that didn't go over too well with me but the hubby was in heaven so i was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> :)pan seared ahi tuna- $9 hh; this was the bombbbbbbbb diggity yo. cooked perfectly and decent sized portions. this is the reason i give this place 3 instead of 2 stars. don't expect too much from here (aside from spending a good amount of money) and you'll be fine.
i've eaten here several times. &nbsp;the food is always good, all organic too if i'm not mistaken. &nbsp;my favorite's are the shareables.. cheese dippers and sweet potato fries. &nbsp;so good you don't want to share. &nbsp;my favorite entree is the ahi with soba noodles. &nbsp; i also like their drinks, the tipsy lemonade being my favorite... although i must admit i'm partial to the girly drinks. &nbsp;however my bf enjoys their selection of beer just the same. &nbsp;as for their service i've only had one so-so experience.. the guy just looked like he wanted to be somewhere else. &nbsp;bartenders have always been great. &nbsp;they have a nice patio where its nice to sit out during the day. &nbsp;there's only one small downside...and that's the price. &nbsp;but go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and its all worth it!
yeah pretty awesome. they deserve these high ratings. ambiance is nice and rustic but not intimidating. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is avail fridays till 7! now that's generous! their seared ahi is tasty, and their drinks are super generous (ahem alllmost undrinkably alcoholic. but wait till the ice melts down). dessert was a brownie with bruleed banana. a tad too pecany for my taste, but im not that nutty a person. service is good if semi insincere. quesadilla was good. no bread bowl? perchance u have to ask. perchance there is none, in spite of this supposedly being a sister company to cheesecake.
yelpers reviews of granville are &quot;on point&quot;this isn't a restaurant that tries hard to get an obnoxious setting, no unnecessary dim lighting. the decor is of a modern rustic feel. granville doesn't try to get you to comment about how nice the place looks. its just an extremely comfortable place to be. i have no issue with the bar being in the middle of the room. its right there as you walk in. my boyfriend and i met up with a friend and managed to snag a couple drinks during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. my mojito was perfect!the bar tenders are refreshingly friendly and attentive. one of 'em is from canada, eh? there was another that reminded &nbsp;me of freddy prince jr with spectacles :-).now to the food. i ordered the bacon and blue burger. juiciest burger i have ever had in my lifetime. it comes with a side of chips.my friend ordered the pan seared lemon ahi (under &quot;shareables&quot; on the menu) now when it came out i was skeptical. the inside of it wasn't cooked all the way but the outside of it had a funny breaded like coating and it was drizzled in a sauce that looked like chocolate. i thought it was a pastry dish at first, lol. i was offered a couple bites and loved it!. there really isn't any lemon to the dish so it wont have an overwhelming citrusy taste to it.bacon and blue and pan seard lemon ahi....go for it !!
this is my &quot;go to&quot; spot for visitors in glendale. it is most certainly my &quot;go to&quot; spot compared to the other offerings at the americana.between myself and the dozens of other friends and family i've accompanied to the granville cafe, i have settled on the sweet potato fries and southwest burger, always cooked to perfection, as my favorite items on the menu. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is also quite reasonable and has a good variety of offerings on the menu.the caipirinha is also quite good, and i've been to rio.my preference is for the outdoor seating as the interior can be quite echo-y.
it's a solid three, maybe three point five even. i never had an issue with granville cafe. there's nothing uber spectacular with the place but there's no major flaws either. if you're looking for a simple lunch/dinner meet up with an old friend or just don't know what to eat, this restaurant ain't a bad choice.a new winner (appetizer) in my books: the housemade hummus - made with a hint of lemon, toasted pine nuts, artichokes, and served with fresh-baked flatbread: $8.95. once you take a bite, you have a problem putting it down. i'm not even a huge hummus fan and i had to stop myself from over indulging. quite tasty.give the sweet potato fries a chance. i think it's legit. most entrees come with a side so maybe you can try these out as one of your options.as for the main entrees, i haven't ran into any issues yet and i hope not to in the future. my last experience was with baby back ribs off their specials menu. it wasn't to die for but i did kill it. that's what guys do right?it is not the cheapest place to choose from, you may be looking at anywhere from $15-30 per person without drinks. they also have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but i think you have to sit at the bar or the counter area for the <span class="highlighted">happy</span> deals.
really great restaurant to check out. i liked my first experience here very much so. i've never really hung out in glendale to be honest. i don't know where anything is. luckily my friend does and this place is one of her favorite watering holes. the restaurant itself is pretty nice. it has a certain rustic charm to it. they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at the bar and inside m-th 4pm-close and on the patio m-th 4pm-7pm. why its different on the patio i have no idea.that right there is a money shot. beers are only $3 ! we also shared a chicken quesadilla that was quite tasty. i would've gotten another one but i knew i would've been super bloated after. not sexy. the service here was pretty good, food and drinks came out pretty fast and our waitress was excellent. if i'm ever in this area again, i would definitely come back for a drink.glendale !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
atwater-village-tavern-los-angeles
this place has the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!! the margaritas are great. my favorite are the chicken tacos.
love the staff and the selection on tap. &nbsp;great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> though every <span class="highlighted">hour</span> is <span class="highlighted">happy</span> at the tavern
good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal on food and drinks. &nbsp;came for $5 margaritas on a tuesday, they were just okay. &nbsp;the salad was delicious and the tacos were also very good.
if you're in the area and need of a place to go to for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i would recommend coming here. atwater village is definitely a new hipster area and this place blends perfectly with it. the space is great! when i came here, the food/drinks were just okay. to me, it was like any other <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> joint.
first time going and could say it was pretty good &nbsp;like the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the avocado fries are the business. two thumbs up &nbsp;in my book will be coming back
i freakin love this place. i've been here numerous times and all the food i've had is sensational. favorites include the corn and the pulled pork. bonus in that the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is awesome, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> lasts clear til 7:30! can't wait to come back and try the brunch selections.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and its a good place to grab a drink and some food. the food was really good. i was surprised because i thought it would be like other <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> bar food. the drinks were great too, and the staff is friendly and helpful. i liked the crowd too, mostly locals there for the games and food. they offer daily deals, like wed was whiskey wed, so well whiskey drinks were $5 all day. parking might be an issue since its located on a main street and its metered parking for only an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> till 8pm.
the cervezas are always perfectly chilled. the nachos are my go-to and are quite a big serving...perfect for sharing. pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! can get pretty loud on the inside, but if you can grab a seat outside on a nice day, perfection!
popped in for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> this evening. ordered the chips &amp; guac, corn, pulled pork sliders and a margarita. food and drink was lovely, the bar itself lacked a bit of atmosphere but i think that's because it was a monday. parking was convent in the back off larga ave. staff were lovely.
village tavern has a great menu. &nbsp;one of the best <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> in the neighborhood, with some great beers and snacks for really great prices. &nbsp;i strongly recommend their corn...it is really yummy!! &nbsp;their avocado fries are not to be missed either!
this place reminds of us of the late, great red rock on sunset blvd.only there are no cool party animal barmaids to do shots with us. pity.the beer selection is awesome!the food is amazing. the grilled cheese with pulled pork is the most delicious, mind blowing sandwich experience we've had in years.i highly recommend adding the side of avocado. so, so good. we went there during the day, and it was basically dead. i imagine it fills up with local hipster types in the evening. therefore, try this place for lunch or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. there was no indication of any <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, or any specials at all, but the food and drink are so brilliant, you simply must give it a try.
came to watch the dodger game during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i had an apple martini and my friend had a cosmo, both tasted pretty good, especially the first one. &nbsp;decided to order some bites to eat. &nbsp; we had the guacamole and chips and the crazy corn. &nbsp;guacamole was disgusting but the chips were sooooo tasty wish we had more..haha. &nbsp;and omg the best thing i had there was most definitely the crazy corn! &nbsp;it was an explosion in my mouth! &nbsp;so so soooo flavorful! &nbsp;i will go to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> just to have this corn on the cob. &nbsp;mmmm. &nbsp;service was a tad slow that it kept ruining my buzz, but in their defense it was quite busy for the amount of bartenders that had on this day. &nbsp; i wil def come back for more. &nbsp;:)
stopped in here for lunch, and it was interesting. &nbsp;i had a smoked brisket burrito, and it was unique. &nbsp;not my favorite grouping of flavors - bbq on a burrito is pretty unique - but there was nothing wrong with it. &nbsp;just not my thing. &nbsp;the bar menu for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> looked really good, so that's probably what i'd come back for.
this place has such good food, really inexpensive during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! and great selection of draft beer! the half bowl of salad filled me up, delicious and healthy. you can choose a choice of meat (or no meat, but the meat is smoky and tasty), and the bowl is filled with lettuce, tomato, bean, corn, tortilla chips... and there is more so it's a really good portion of vegetable for people who love to eat healthy loll... and it's like 7 dollars (even not in <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!) my friend loves the hamburger and we both love the taco and crispy chicken wings...
go for the drink specials! they have a different one everyday and they're a great deal and taste great. thursdays, the day i normally go, is $5 martinis. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 4-7 and it's great too but the menu is small. also, the avocado fries suck don't listen to what everyone says!!
hungry at 11 pm where to go :(! i ended up in atwater village hunting for food. i had their margeritas (strong) and the tacos and nachos were delicious. nice spot to chill with friends and i will def go back for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.(varies on daily basis)
love this spot for lunch. great beer selection and very good mexican grill items, discounted at lunch time. the pulled pork tacos are absolutely delicious, albeit a tad spicy for those who are not into that. the joint is small, narrow, and i can see it getting packed around <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but it is definitely one of my favorites in the area.
i'm giving this place a couple of stars because of the drinks and the service. they have a good beer selection, made decent mixed drinks, and everyone who served us was kind. also, they have some pretty great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals listed on the wall.now for the food. i ordered the bbq chicken burrito, and my boyfriend ordered the brisket grilled cheese. i love and admire the idea of adding barbequed meat to pretty much anything, but it just didn't come together here. the grilled cheese was so greasy and heavy that we were both done with it after one bite each. my burrito was not very good, and something definitely tasted off about it. turns out it made me extremely sick for the next week. like, bed-ridden sick. sick to the point where i still have nightmares featuring that chicken.bottom line: would return for those <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, but not much else.
i love this place! we came in on a wednesday night at 7:00, and the bar had a nice energy going, but wasn't packed. there were 10 people in our party, and the staff immediately helped us make a large table in the back area. this place had everything we were looking for; nice atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, great food, fantastic <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> choices and prices, and a free parking lot in the back! everyone in our group raved about the food... mini tacos, buffalo chicken sliders, and mexican corn on the cob were all big hits. the $2. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> corn was the overwhelming favorite though. the only thing that could add to our positive experience would be if they added a floss dispenser in the bathroom. corn stuck in your teeth is not attractive. &nbsp;;)
i know this is relative to different situations, but ordering here was difficult today. my group was with a newly adopted dog that's still a little timid, so it's hard to leave her on her own. we didn't know that we had to order on our own - we were given menus and sat outside (they have a patio for pups.) it was a really hot day, and we were sitting out there for awhile before we got up to ask about ordering. the two people working the bar (a girl and a guy - didn't get their names) were busy taking photos on her phone while he was watching the ballgame before a commercial came on and he acknowledged me. he told me as if i were silly for asking that we had to order inside. oh. cool. because we took turns ordering, all of our food also came out at different times. the bus boy was super friendly and accommodating, and the only reason i left a tip. the food, however, is delicious (even though my 'crazy corn' [an elote] was half the size of the ones my friends ordered) and wonderfully priced on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. their drinks were good, though a little on the small side, even for non-alcoholic drinks (i think the bartender was annoyed when i asked for a large pint glass for water instead of the customary small plastic cup they had next to the water dispenser, which wouldn't have bothered me if they had waiting service - i just didn't want to have to keep getting up and going inside to refill my water glass.)if you're looking for cocktails, you could probably find a better option for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, only because they are on the small size and not much of a deal unless you're doing well drinks ($10 for a signature cocktail during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is still a little pricy to me) but i do like that for being a great beer bar, they have a full bar to back it up.i definitely want to come back and try brunch sometime, especially during a dodgers game. +1 star for being one of few bars to televise the games!
atwater village tavern, aka the spot! man... full on mexican smokehouse with brisket, pulled pork, chicken , and the best freaking smoked wings in los angeles! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4-7 and even a better brunch on weekends! great food , great service and at a great price! if you like mexican food and bbq this is your place!
this is my fifth time here and i've been meaning to write a review for awhile. everything i've tried here has been delicious!!!!! great selection of beers on tap, rotating special and an excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. cute bartenders and free chips never hurt either. this place rocks!
when did glendale blvd in atwater get so cool? this place is pretty perfect... great craft beers on tap and delicious bar food (with an emphasis on mexican favorites) on the menu. the mexican grub isn't &quot;authentic,&quot; but when you eat the loaded brisket nachos, you won't worry about authenticity (something &nbsp;that's more of a hipster strawman compaint anyway). plus the place has pretty great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals mondays- thursdays that make it a great after-work drink and eats spot.
cold drafts! &nbsp;clean tap lines and clean glasses! &nbsp;these are things that fall by the wayside elsewhere. can't tell you how many times i get a warm, syrupy ipa in la. great tenders. attentive service. &nbsp;good deals on the cheap beers. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu rules. great small bites. cheap and good. but as for the rest of the menu: &nbsp; i have had some lukewarm tacos here with room temp tortillas. and some seriously mysterious menu items. in fact, i'd swear off the food if it were not so close. it's always lukewarm. beware.
i've been here quite a few times and i usually enjoy it. good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals, laid-back vibe. all good.but... came here last week and within about 5 minutes we were evacuated because of a fire in the kitchen. whole place was filled with smoke. instead of just handing everybody back their credit cards (there were maybe 6 or 7 patrons total since it was pretty late on wednesday), the lady decided to ring us all up one-by-one. you either had to leave your drink or down it. i'm sorry, but if you're being evacuated, you shouldn't be taking your time to charge people. in fact, you shouldn't be charging people at all if we're being kicked out and can't enjoy our drinks. maybe the bar tender wasn't really thinking about it, but i went home and felt kinda snubbed... bummer.
atwater village is the place to go if you're looking for a laid back neighborhood bar with great food and an awesome beer selection. &nbsp; i've been coming to atwater with my knitting meetup and it's become our group's favorite place to meet. &nbsp;the staff has always been accommodating and has allowed us to reconfigure the tables in the back to fit our needs. &nbsp;they've got a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu that last until 7:30 and rotating drink specials depending on the night. &nbsp;i know $5 margarita wednesday is a group favorite! &nbsp;there is some outdoor seating out front and plenty of booths and tables inside along with seating at the bar. &nbsp;there's street parking out front and free parking in the back. &nbsp;if you're looking for a great neighborhood bar with good food and great service then make your way to atwater village! &nbsp;be sure to say hi if you see a bunch of knitters on a wednesday night!
i'm really starting to love this place. great local clean bar with great drink prices. chill bartenders. i love their daily deals. came here on a friday once and it was the bartender's choice shots and it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>... making our total bill of a round of shots and a round of beer super amazingly priced. it's a chill bar to come and have drinks with some friends. only thing is the food here is pricey. so, come here for the drinks. food prices however, you have been warned. nachos were good though!!
this place has been killin' it for me. i absolutely love the brisket and pulled pork. i usually hate on food that is fusion-y, but i haven't tasted a single here thing that i haven't loved. highly recommend the brisket tacos, the pulled pork sliders and their pico de gallo fries (cotija cheese!!). beer selection changes frequently and stays interesting. if you're drinkin on the cheap, currently, they have stone pale ales for $5 ($3 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!!).
its getting harder and harder to find places to go and find a wide selection of craft beer i haven't drank yet and that also has great food. &nbsp;found it . &nbsp;went on a thursday around 4pm before the dodgers game and had some mini tacos for $5 can you say <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! the environment was chill and the bartender was nice and attentive even though he had his hands full.
love everything about this place...if you feel like grabbing a drink and just kicking back with a few friends...this is the place to be.... it's located in one of my favorite neighborhoods so that's a plus for me...their beer selections are awesome and omg you must try their loaded fries...it is so mouthwatering and full of flavor. dang my taste buds are screaming for those loaded fries. i need to go there again pronto. the ambiance is fantastic, the staff was great. the bartender was extremely helpful in deciding what beer to order. they also have drink specials everyday. &nbsp;oh did i mention that their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 4 to 7. score!overall, great place to have a beer with great company. &nbsp;this place has become one of our favorite bars. my hubby and i will definitely be back.
honestly this place is like cheers, we get greeted by all the bartenders, they all know what we want with out a word spoken.maurice (the owner) is super chill and is always willing to entertain request for new beers. hes always got time to take a minute to see how we feel and is willing to work the bar to help his employees out, thats the kind of service and dedication that needs to be seen more.the daily deals of shots, margaritas, and the <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> make coing here weekly worth it. the beer selection is by far one of the best ive ever had, always rotating new beers on the tap.i just wanna say thanks to the village tavern gang for being so on point every time. you guys rock!!
we came here to meet some friends on a friday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work. the place is new, i used to live down the street and i wish this place was open when we lived here. their food is good and so are their beers! i like that they have local breweries on tap and the food isn't horribly priced. i got the flight of beers and the staff were very helpful in helping us pick out some good ones. also this place is a order then find your own seat kind of place which i like. we also ordered a few food items such as the avocado fries, regular fries and i got the chicken torta and my fiance got the grilled cheese. everything was good and it was made with quality. the size of the food is filling and you definitely get your money's worth. of course i love the vibe of this place. definitely a hipster area. a great spot.
dude...dude.i've been living .3 miles from this place since it opened, and i never knew this culinary marvel existed. and you know what? i'm kinda pissed that yelp didn't give this place as high a rating, making me think i could skip just another wannabe silverlake hipster &quot;tavern&quot; in the atwater area. also i'm moving next week and won't be able to savor this delectable blessing again (well i'm not even moving that far, but, the 101...you know).i got the bbq chicken nachos. &quot;nachos aren't really a meal,&quot; you might say. but this was a revelation: chunks of tender, glazed bbq chicken punctuate the mount of chips, which are expertly layered with cheese and beans--no naked chips at the bottom of the pile! i shamefully admit that i polished off the whole plate. the hubs ordered the brisket burrito, of which i was able to steal one luscious bite before he wolfed it down. i knew bbq + mexican would be a great combo, but...whoa. they also have a pretty impressive beer list (if you're into that sort of thing) and some good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. definitely going back the next time i'm in the area.
my most fantastic local find this year! it's so good i almost don't want to blow it up on here as i don't want yall taking overbut - damn it's amazing they deserve this review.my new favorite thing - pickled jalapeno rings with pulled pork and slaw! killer! i literally wanted to go back the next day just for those! i restrained myself just writing about it makes me want it now!!!super clever hybrid of bbq and mexican - if they only had sushi it would be my perfect place - but they rally don't need it when they have &quot;crazy corn&quot; - the best grilled corn with savory sauces ever - and i make this dish a lot for parties and my friends and these guys make mine look like baby food! seriously check this place out - cool out door patio with water for dogs. decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> friendly staff and good prices!i can't write any more i will only want to eat it now and it's late! :(check this little atwater hole in the wall out - it's amazing!
after the six month settling-in period, time to visit avt - many, many craft brews (1/2 on-tap) and a decent collection of custom cocktails. &nbsp;daily drink specials are great and in the $2-5 range, even if you're not around <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the service is bar-style - go up to the bar/counter, order and tag your table with a # sign (preferably gathering your utensils, napkins and water cups on the way back.)2 tv's on sports; the touchscreen jukebox (touchtunes), is also a photobooth ($0.50/play or $3 for a photo) and controllable by iphone/android app, if you wish. &nbsp;it's an eclectic mix of music that isn't exactly going to turn the place into either a rave party nor a country line-dancing stomp, but it's curious enough of a variety to find new music to listen while you embibe and injest.the food menu is what caught me off-guard. what looks like perhaps a tex-cali-mex street taco/burrito/tostada assembly, has a distinct number of vegan-friendly options that are worth exploring (hence how the avocado &quot;fries&quot; showed up - they're actually more like avocado tempura slices.) &nbsp;the &quot;buffalo&quot; roasted cauliflower &quot;wings&quot; was quite fun - roast large clusters of cauliflower, and toss them in wing sauce. a bbq diced chicken tostada salad was quite flavorful - everything is mildly spiced, so you'll have to hot sauce things to kick it up a notch. jalapeno rings are sort of like mildly spicy versions of fried pickle chips. crazy cob is a good version of good old el elote loco, though priced double of your typical shopping cart vendor on olympic bl. the fish burrito was totally well-balanced, and similar to a wahoo-style without any rice.had our dog along, who was welcome on the sheltered and heated patio (not that we've needed that this year in the 80's in january.) &nbsp;runners gathered the empty plates quickly, but you'll have to visit the bar again for any additions or drinks to be added to your tab.fun, chill-out and relax place, sit at the bar if you want to catch a game, and a nice beery addition to the atwater central proprietors.

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is daily from 3-7pm and all day monday.this bar has been open since january 2015 and is owned by the same person as 'the famous', which is directly next door.the space is a very casual, retro design. upon entering from the street, you actually walk down into the bar. it's a basement restaurant, pub and game room. bartenders were quite chatty, laid back, and friendly. they have all draft beers,wine, and house cocktails for $1 off regular prices. they also serve a cheeseburger, fries with miller's lite or coors for $14. there are a variety draft beers on tap, which rotate, and a nice variety of ales. unfortunately, they do not serve barleywine, at least as of yet.this is a great addition to glendale, which is not really known for its cool pub scene.tip - the americana is located across the streetparking - free 90 minute garage parking on maryland ave or limited free street parking a 2-3 blocks away
this hidden secret location.. and i say that because it's downstairs and the front does not look like a bar. this is a great place for large groups of people! we went to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with about 15 people and there was so much room. there are darts, jenga and other great games to play! they also have booth areas if you want a more comfortable feel. i would talk about the drinks considering they have a great collection of beer, but what i do want to focus on is the food. the food here is actually really great! from the cesar salad to the fish n chips, to the oxtail fries.. amazing! definitely go here for the food and check out everything else!
very chilled atmosphere and free darts to play! &nbsp;great for large groups and they have decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. &nbsp;they also have shuffle board but you actually have to have quarters to play so kinda lame but at least it's still there as an option. &nbsp;the bartenders were really friendly and their food was good. &nbsp;will definitely go back there with my coworkers again.
welcome to the moose den- glendale's first underground bar!! (i think???) yeah, we're a little behind in the nightlife department, and that's why i had to scope this place out once i heard about it.anyway, the moose den is super chill. maybe a little too chill. but to be fair it was a monday night and i was attracted by their all-day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so for that and the nice bartenders i give it an extra star for benefit of the doubt. i think they're going for the lodge-y theme, so i'm not sure where all the games came in, but i'm ok with it. we had the horse's neck (yum. order this) and the rusty nail, then opted to head upstairs to the famous for a couple more so we could sip on our drinks on the plush couches in the dark. i'd still come back here though! maybe not on a monday unless i was with a group.side note- how is there no pool table here?!
two things drew me into this new find: it was listed as &quot;hot and new&quot; on yelp and the sign outside read: &quot;daily soup: whiskey.&quot; sure, why not? and there i went, descended down the stairs to the moose den....the moose den marketed itself as a whiskey bar, but turned out to be a let down. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals were weak. a buck off wines, house drinks, draft and well drinks 4-7pm and all day monday. meh. house drinks are weak. the menu featured basic drinks, and didn't even have their own special old fashioned or manhattan. how are they a whiskey place??the best whiskey drink on the menu they had was a rusty nail, which was simply cutty dark scotch and drambuie on the rocks. with the store front name the moose den and them making it a whiskey bar, a whiskey aficionado would not impressed by their selection and drink choices. however, mac and cheese from scratch was good, and the bartenders were friendly.there's definitely room for improvement. i'd like to see some craft cocktails added to the menu. the set up is already there. dart boards and shuffleboards are there and with a big screen tv for weekend sports game.

great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
i love 5 line tavern! it's great for <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>! they have 50 draft beers and your second one is 1 penny during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! their food is also really good but takes some time to come to the table. overall i love the vibe of this place and love going to their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
i love this place, they simply have the best value <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in eagle rock. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts is 11am -7pm. &nbsp;amazing! they have buy one get the sencond drink for 1 penny. &nbsp;i also like the food, my favorite so far is the sausage platter.
decent beer selection, service and food. the cocktails were good but expensive. i suggest going during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or its pricey for a pub. the truffle fries were good but the pizza is mediocre.
came here to try something new in our area and was pleasantly surprised that we caught their .01 beer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special. yes a penny, buy one get the next for a penny! what a deal. the food was also excellent. i ordered the tangy buffalo pizza. i am usually a fan of thick crust, but this pizza definitely changed my view on that preference. the crust, sauce, and toppings were all packed with amazing flavor. the man had the chicken breast sandwich which was also just as tasty. would definitely be back especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
this is a pretty nice cozy spot. &nbsp;they have pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (buy one drink, get the second one for $0.01). &nbsp;if you're looking for appetizers, definitely get the nachos! &nbsp;it's enough to feed a whole family and you may not want to eat dinner since their nachos is seriously ginormous. &nbsp;it's a very interesting gastropub. &nbsp;they have a cafe area in one spot and a bar on a separate side. &nbsp;drinks are definitely on point. &nbsp;great place for a group and a nice hangout date with your girlfriend!
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which was advertised on the chalkboard outside with the daily specials, but they don't have hh on fridays. ordered the lobster pasta but was served imitation crabmeat. &nbsp; so i guess diner beware. up side- wait staff was very nice.
located in a great neighborhood of eagle rock! no way! if your in the area and just want to chill out and grab a beer or two then look no further. you came to the right spot.5 line tavern is one of those hipster bars that you can relax with your favorite drink, watch a game or catch up with friends. we've been here a few times and always a good experience. great staff, awesome beer selections, and reasonable prices. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a bonus! now they have a special from 11 to 6, buy any drink get the second one for a penny. awesomeness! i am definitely taking advantage!they also have great food varieties to choose from and you can also order from bmpp next door. we ordered the half hawaiian and half mexican pizza which was an excellent choice that was recommended by our awesome waiter.this place is definitely worth trying out when you're in the eagle rock area. best to come by during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
just left this place. food is pretty overpriced and very bland. looks like they got a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but i wouldn't come back here only cause i had to add salt to my fettuccine alfredo. i've made better pizza and alfredo at home for way less and i'm mexican! anyway, overall overpriced bland food. never going back. oh and food took forever and there weren't many people in the joint.
i stopped in for the 1-4 pm <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special which is buy one get the second for a penny. got the $6 golden road ipa which is $6, but got only $13 in change from my $20. when i asked the bartender if the drink was $7 she said it was tax. ah yes, i forgot about that 16% tax.
tried out this place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they have a wide variety of beers on tap, tv's galore and service was quick. food-wise, i tried the fries and chicken wings and both were good. only set-back was they don't have nba league pass and i was hoping to watch a good game. nevertheless, i will be coming back.
no more 5 line for my family and i . my husband ate their sausage platter and got sick . not only that they stopped <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ! the manager said they no longer need to have it because they are making enough money and no longer need to... the food on top of it is not that good quality . terrible would not recommend it to anyone
we were just passing by when we stumbled upon this place. the service was outstanding. we sat in the bar and was tended to by a very friendly bartender, joe. joe recommended the burgers and they were outstanding. not dry, very tasty and extra large. this place had a large selection of beers on tap and a wonderful collection of whiskey. the price was comparable to other locations nearby. the only reason why i did not give them 5 stars was because their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is very early. 11:00 to 4:00. most people do not get off work until after 5:00 p.m.
love all the flat screens here. &nbsp;great for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. pepperoni pizza was goooooood-- fresh cheese, perfectly baked dough, crispy pepperoni yumminess! &nbsp;sausage+pretzel appetizer was delish. &nbsp;martini was strong &amp; on point... definitely a neighborhood fave. &nbsp;lucky me, live down the street :)
i'm not sure why it took so long to finally head into 5 line tavern, but my belly is sure <span class="highlighted">happy</span> i did. &nbsp;the first time, i came by for dinner - i was thinking i'd have to choose between typically bar foods, pizza and burgers but they proved me wrong instantly with the breadth of their menu. i definitely recommend their steak; it was so good - but the lamb looked delish as well.they have an amazing assortment of beers on tap, so if you're in the eagle rock area and looking for a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - 5 line is your best bet; and their specialty cocktails are great, too. &nbsp;just try the bloody mary; trust me!
after lowering my rating based on the modified (down) review, i received an e-mail that asked for me to contact the gm-mickey. &nbsp;did that, explained my point of view, and he told me it was strictly a business decision related to turning tables in the evening when sporting events are on tv. &nbsp;still a great place for food, but the non-<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on the beer(50 taps-good selection) is too steep for me ($8-9/pint).
this is a classy establishment where everything works and the food far exceeds &quot;bar food&quot; expectations. a great place to watch sports games with many screens and a cozy yet cool atmosphere. with 50 beers on tap and a full bar with good service, you'll never have to settle for anything. &nbsp;but a special note about the food: it's fresh, creatively put together and absolutely scrumptious! i've had the arugula/goat cheese/artichoke salad, the burger, the hummus plate, and the ham sub, and many versions of the pizza (thanks to the momma's and pappa's next door that shares the kitchen). fantastic! this is now my go-to spot to hang with a friend, especially with their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials.
i came on a friday evening during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - ends at 6pm. &nbsp;given the previous reviews, i thought this would be a hit. the bar and wait staff had some serious difficulties getting their shit together. i waited about 10 minutes to get a menu- i had to flag down the waitress. and to make matters worst, i waited about 20 minutes before the waitress came over with my drink. in fact, two other tables/ customers that came in after me got their drinks pretty quickly. the food was okay but nothing spectacular. i'm sad that this place got such raving reviews and clearly isn't living up to the hype.
as a german, i know about soccer and beer. and i've never watched a football or baseball game in my entire life. so i couldn't care less for bars with a tv mounted on the wall (let alone one with two dozen tv's). but this place is a-may-zing! a full bar in addition to a huge and excellent draught beer selection, surprisingly gourmet-style menu items, lots of vegetarian choices, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals, friendly staff and soon an expansive roof-top lounge. all with a beautiful and refreshingly non-hipster vibe. i've lived in eagle rock for 20 years and this is hands-down our new favorite place.
this place is really cool! i came in after a trip to target during the afternoon and it was great. i had the monster burger and it was delicious! there are 50 beers on tap and the bartenders look so cute in their prohibition gear! definitely looking forward to this place taking off, nice to have such a great place in the hood! oh and the other cool thing is that it's attached to bmpp and even though 5 line has an awesome menu, you can also order anything off the bmpp menu so while i have a steak or salmon or something, your kids can have pizza....brilliant! looking forward to trying the grinders, they look great! welcome to eagle rock, 5 line! i'll see you for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
i should have written this review a while ago but better late than never. &nbsp;this is my favorite pizza joint, not just because of the pizza.. the beer selection here is top tier. the bartenders are the best. if joe is there you will get fantastic service. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is kick ass here. you can order an expensive beer, etc. delirium or chimay then you get the second one for a penny! yes you heard me right, a penny. then it starts all over, you pay for the next one then a penny. so understanding that it's very easy to leave this place feeling like you should take a cab,do the right thing have a designated driver or take a cab.. back to the <span class="highlighted">happiness</span>, holy sheit did i mention the pizza is fkn amazing here! same owner as &quot;mamas pizza&quot; next door. ok just do this, you're there because it's primarily a bar. you can watch a game have good beer and order the best pizza. show up with a hot date and your life is complete, or meet one there ;)..this place kicks ass! order pizza #29 and add pepperoni, it's my favorite and i have excellent taste.
came here many times in the past and loved the service and especially the food. decided to come by for some lunch waited over 45 minutes for my food just to find out that the waiter forgot to put the order in!! when i asked to speak to the manager he politely said that he couldn't do anything about our current tab because it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the nerve that he had to calmly say sorry but it was a mistake. i can understand when it's busy and the waiters are running all over the place, but there was only about 6-8 patrons including myself in the restaurant. it's very unfortunate that this will be the last time i come here since i always liked their service and loved their food. mistakes happen but at least take ownership on what happened. horrible service from both the waiter and the management.

just popped in for a drink here, and the place has a cool ambiance. i didn't get to see the upstairs, but i think they have live music at times. we just had a sangria, red wine, and cheese plate (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!) and enjoyed it. i would return to try more!
awww my little sweet wine bar! i cannot believe a place like this exist in glendale thank you!!!!me and my partner go here often they have live music and amazing wine they also have really good food and offer a menu from my fav sushi place next door sushi kai.our fav bartender is this guy with blue eyes i dont remember his name lol but he knows alot about the wines and cares about the customers.i have had the flat bread ommmmggg sooo good and the smoked salmon appetizer! they also have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with different selections of wines both white and red! its a special little place and i hope they stay open for a long long time!
i went here recently on a saturday night with a group of 4 other people. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was great from 4-7, $5 glasses of the house wine (i had the house cabernet and it was very good for the price) and also discounted appetizers. for dinner i had the tomato and mozzarella panini and it was so full of flavor i would definitely get it again, and it also came with a nice side salad. waiters were knowledgeable of all other wines, and it was nice to see more than one choice for riesling :) did i mention the live music? good stuff!
(dined 10/21/13 m @ 4:00pm): this wine bar left me coasting towards a calming state - but where's the gallery!?a coworker and i returned to town after an afternoon offsite event just in time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so i recommended the left coast wine bar &amp; gallery - because a glass (or two) of wine sounded nice, and i remembered they had outdoor seating to enjoy this lovely weather.we actually arrived too early so we killed some time in the nearby bevmo! until the doors opened. we casually walked across the street, parked ourselves at a tall table out on the front patio and allowed the rest of the day to sweep us away with good conversation, libations, and snacks at discounted prices. here was how our happiest of <span class="highlighted">hours</span> went: &nbsp;sangria ($5.00 ea. hh) - this deep red elixir with minute chunks of various fruit was the perfect prescription for a warm california fall afternoon. our bulbous glasses (two each) were filled to the rim as each sip elicited a smile and a relaxed state of being. although the potency was minimal, the results were a resounding positive vibe. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jvt2inwc8giq6sh2ug9vw">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a> left coast pizza ($8.99 hh) - this round flatbread personal-sized pizza was drizzled with fresh herbs and olive oil, mozzarella cheese, diced tomatoes, chopped onions, pasilla peppers, and prosciutto. i enjoyed the crunchiness of the excess melted cheese that extended past the crust. the saltiness of the prosciutto somehow seemed amplified, but the rest of the ingredients aided in dampening this effect. however, i felt this was a bit overcooked as the cheese had several dark spots throughout, yet the vegetables still remained fresh and juicy. my only suggestion was to increase the size maybe one more inch in diameter. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=smxrqq3n-qzqngdky7mhjq&amp;userid=8jvt2inwc8giq6sh2ug9vw">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>service - our server was a friendly attractive woman by the name of rachelle. the place had just opened so we chose wherever we wanted to sit (outside on this beautifully warm day). she immediately greeted us with both standard and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menus. we quickly placed our drink order and soon enough received them, at which time we then placed our food order, which unfortunately took longer than expected - since there were only two other small parties. we ordered a second round of drinks which again came quickly. lastly, the check was delivered once requested. overall, things were good.parking - there was metered street parking along the main drag of harvard st. otherwise, we parked in the nearby parking structure on maryland ave. where the first 90 minutes are free, then $1.00 for every 30 minutes after that (we paid $3.00).atmosphere, d&eacute;cor, ambience - there was a nice front outdoor patio with umbrellas and heating lamps if necessary. inside, it was a bit narrow and tight with several tables and chairs along with stools at the bar. there was a slightly roomier upstairs lounge area with couches, chairs, tables, and paintings hung on the walls, where live entertainment occurred on a nightly basis. generally, the walls were a dark color, and there was plenty of both electric and natural lighting. i didn't recall any tvs nor background music. however, the street traffic can be annoying as you're very close to the americana on brand. a real chill place. attire - it was totally casual so i would normally be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops.overall, left coast wine bar &amp; gallery was a nice wine option in glendale as there were so few of them. they had a decent selection of wines and beers with comparable prices. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu was limited as well as their general food selection. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_c4gl9sscrzva-5lod3npa&amp;userid=8jvt2inwc8giq6sh2ug9vw">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a> i'd come back simply for a drink or two while i hung with friends and caught up. i found very good value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (total experience was around $35.00 before tip), and a nice place to chill with your drinks and hopefully some live music if you're here in the evening. and, they accepted my credit card of choice...amex!
jax-bar-and-grill-glendale
cute place. &nbsp;didn't make it for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but saw the menu and looked good. &nbsp;great food and atmosphere. &nbsp;lemon drop was delicious!
food is horrible, and it's been that way for years. what is the managemnt thinking? the bar is good, and while drinks are expensive during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. their solid republican based customers make up for their lack of business skills. one star for the high cost of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks, and no stars for their food. a great bar if you do not eat, and the music sucks. bad management overall. the owner must be on his death bed, because no one in his right mind would let jax become a mediocer restaraunt.
i love coming here! &nbsp;a jazz bar in glendale? &nbsp;sweet!they have free salsa, chips, and hot dogs for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on beers are really cheap too!the dinners are great too. &nbsp;there is a seafood stew (can't remember the name of it) and steamer clams that are incredible.this is a great place for a date as they serve delicious wines and they also have live jazz!the music can get a bit loud if you're sitting close, but i like that.the service can be slow when it gets busy, but other than that., this is a great place!
wow terrible service at bar today. had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu listed outside the door, stated &quot;flights of wine&quot; and lunch menu. went in during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at 3pm, no wine on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and no lunch menu available???!!!! when we walked in, server did not acknowledge us, but kept talking to another patron, finally got servers attention but service was downhill from there. won't go back.
just wished this place had a proper <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! i like coming here for lunch and after-work drinks with some coworkers.this place has been around forever and smells like it too! there is this odd bar smell thats on the unpleasant side. dimly lit, its the perfect place to drown your sorrows while listening to some live jazz music. although there's no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price on drinks, there are free snacks served such as meatballs, hot dogs, wings, or chips with salsa. fish tacos, salmon salad and blt are recommended!
i attend this spot either for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or lunch. they have live jazz music and a pretty good selection of liquor and wine. the bartender always lets me try the three varietals of red they have. the glasses are bout $12 but are hefty. if you are looking for a cute glendale date spot then come here. when its slow you get better service but sometimes it does super busy you don't see your waitress. the restrooms are a bit small, but are fine. love the warm free nibbles during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. parking sucks so good think i park at work and can walk here.
i am not a fan of jax. too dark inside. the food is nothing to right home about. the live music at night (check the days when this is available) is nice, but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a joke.
stopped in jax tonight to just grab something quick at the bar. elegant, old world atmosphere. there was a jazz band playing to the left of the bar. and an older couple, looking all romantic, were sharing a bottle of red wine and enjoying the jazz band.we sat at the bar. i got a mai tai, which was a little bit too strong for me. i didn't finish it. and we split their bbq salmon sandwich. for $3 extra they split it for us. and we also got to select our choice of sides, so we chose mashed potatoes. we were pleasantly surprised when the plates came with not only the mashed potatoes, but also with coleslaw as well. we had a very nice bartender, michael, who told us all about their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and music that they have there. &nbsp;i am looking forward to visiting again on a friday or saturday night.
this place was literally my second home when i used to work in glendale right across the street. good for lunch. better for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.they play live jazz - with some old school cats- beware - the music can get way too loud for sucha small hole in the wall.food is decent but cheap drinks will keep me coming back.
i work up the street from here, so i go for lunch on occasion. its great food, but when they are busy, its hard to get a servers attention. &nbsp;thats the only real downer. &nbsp;also, for lunch the prices are kind of high.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good, and they have a guy playing the piano. i normally get a dirty martini...they have some beer specials.this is a dark older restaurant, the bar has older guys hanging out at it, some of them grumpy. but its still a cool vibedinner is great, and again the food is good. but it all comes down to the attentiveness of your server.
how do i love jax? &nbsp;a lotttt and for a long time. this is the place to come i n glendale for good food, great ambiance, the best drinks in town, and great jazz. &nbsp;jax is so versatile, we come with our kids, with friends, family, i've been coming here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for years, for lunch with co-workers, a wonderful place for a date....etc, etc, etc,. &nbsp;the cedar plank salmon is a favorite as well as the jax chicken salad with it's almond slivers, grilled chicken breast and perfect dressing. &nbsp;my kids love the ribs and the petite filet, while the baby-daddy usually goes for one of the steaks....anyway, i loooooove jax! &nbsp;they really know how to pour a drink, and if you're a wine lover like me don't think you're gonna get some little 5 ounce pour oh nooooo......it's really good- so many memories and more to made there.....
why did i never eat here until now? &nbsp;that is because my hubby had told me that he didn't like the place. &nbsp;because he ate here 10 years ago, &nbsp;when he was poor and could only afford the <span class="highlighted">happy-hour</span> fried appetizers.i should have know better than to listen to him!! great place, great comfortable atmosphere &amp; vibe. &nbsp;the food did take about 20 minutes to come out, but damn - it was worth the wait. &nbsp;i had the:prime top sirloin steak $17.95center-cut sirloin steak, grilled to order and topped with a bleu cheese peppercorn saucei ate everything off of my plate, including the garnish. &nbsp;the crowd can be a little older (okay, a lot older depending on what time you are there), but on a friday night there was a buzzing crowd at the long bar and a great vibe overall. &nbsp; live jazz everynight (during happyhour, and from 9pm to 1am).
jax gets a 5 for the old timey &quot;ratpack&quot;- like atmosphere, a 3.5 for the service and a 4 for the beer selection and a 3 for the food. food is oh kay. you're probably better to stick w/ appetizers than anything else. the food is oh kay but not anything special and it's not super expensive, but you can get much better for that price elsewhere. even the free wings they put out during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are pretty bad. the front part of the restaurant has a nice vibe to it. it definitely feels like a place your grandparents may have gone to 50 or 60 years ago, but in a &quot;hip&quot; sorta way. there are a couple of annoying waiters that have been there a long time and some non-annoying servers as well. the back part of the restaurant is huge! music at nite is oh kay. nothing great, usually a bit cheezy. i guess it's a nice touch? some may like it more than others. the cheese factor of their musicians isn't high on my list. so really, this place is more of a 3.5 but i'll give it a 4 instead of a 3, b/c it's better than 3 if you're just having a beer or 2 and maybe an app.
had a rough day yesterday and today, so what better solution than to go to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at the local bar. something about the holidays that makes me sad, which is because i really can't be with the one i love...i just try to get a hold of my guy that i love, but i can sense a lot of people are preventing that....so, i ordered a mystery beer for $2. i hate beer, but figured that should cheer me up. then, like the other reviewer tiffany, i felt persuaded to order the sauteed barcelona shrimp, which sounded deliciously fancy, but wasn't to my liking. i didn't have the heart to send it back since the bartender staff &nbsp;(first the guy, then the girl) were very attentive, gracious, and always made sure i was doing ok and <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. next time, i have to remember being adventurous may not be the best thing to do....but hey, i did have leftovers, which i appreciate due to the large portion. and coming from an appetizer, you get your $15 worth. however, next time i will be sure to order a fish or pasta dish, something more filling. with this dish, you do have to mix it with the bread to really appreciate the dish.i loved the piano playing not only christmas songs, but also some barry manilow songs and other romance songs. it made me more sad a little, but i had my readings with me to help distract me.....next time i have to try the pumpkin martini as well as sit by the piano to chase my blues.......and hopefully with someone i love.....i wonder if he thinks of me and ever wants to see me the way i want to see him.....
wow this place is place is filled with a bunch of old timers! middle aged - geezer status! don't get me wrong i have nothing against senior citizens, but i'm just not used to enjoying a drink at the bar with the geriatrics. we were the youngest ones inside that entire joint. &nbsp;a friend and i decided to stop in for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and live jazz, but it was pretty lame when we found out that the band wasn't getting on until 9. by that time we headed out to our second destination so we didn't get the full experience. ehh maybe next time. &nbsp;at least we did catch the exciting laker game that went down to the wire. it was hilarious hearing loud mouths at the bar yelling &quot;shiiiiiiiiiit!!!&quot; when gasol missed a free throw to tie the game up during crunch time. go heat! &nbsp;anyways... the people here are friendly, drinks are a bit pricey.. a stiff jack n' coke ran up to 8 bucks, and although i did not try the food, some of their dish's looked really good.
this place is the shizzy. &nbsp;it deserves every last star up here because it rocks. &nbsp;i know that most of my <span class="highlighted">happiness</span> over it is due to the novelty. &nbsp;we don't have places this cool where i live. &nbsp;glendale is a good 40 minutes to an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> away. &nbsp;i was in the area performing for some old lady who tricked me into dancing at her birthday for free. &nbsp;after which, my bf proclaimed we needed to celebrate my 'retirement' from performing for free. &nbsp;(he's not going to let me fall for that again!)i started with an outstanding lemon drop. &nbsp;tart and strong. &nbsp;i should have had something stiffer, but i hadn't eaten since morning. &nbsp;i had a bite of the warm, fresh sourdough and it was delicious! &nbsp;but i mean, when is fresh warm sourdough not delicious?thankfully, yelpers had steered me in good directions when it comes to food. &nbsp;my baby had the cornflake tenders. &nbsp;i think he felt it was some of the best white meat chicken he's had. &nbsp;he usually steers clear of white meat and likes the moisture that dark meat chicken brings. &nbsp;i had the cedar plank salmon. &nbsp;hands down the best salmon i've had in a while. &nbsp;it had a loose crust that i want to say was panko, the crust was buttery, light and perfect with the mustard rub. &nbsp;it came with delicious quick pickle, i usually don't like quick pickle. &nbsp;most of the time it's too sweet or just tasted like soggy cucumber, but this was a perfect balance. &nbsp;the carrots were also perfectly cooked and not too buttery. &nbsp;however, the zucchini was the vegetable standout. &nbsp;i don't know how they managed to make it so good, but it was so good. &nbsp;after they cooked it, they tossed it in some sort of warm relish with tomato, red onion and green onion. &nbsp;the flavor was amazing. &nbsp;i'll eat zucchini in any form, it's one of my favorite forms of produce, but this was truly amazing.on a sad note, the second lemon drop i had was way sweeter and subpar compared to the first one. &nbsp;but hey, i'm willing to forgive. &nbsp;when there is jazz fiddle and trumpet going on with food this bomb... i can take everything else in stride.
tavern-on-brand-glendale-2
love this place... their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> rocks!

best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in glendale. they have tons of good beers on tap and 2 for $6 from noon-7.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (12pm-7pm everyday). there's parking behind the venue or across the street, there's a parking structure that takes cash only). limited craft beers on tap and almost no stouts besides guinness. if you're looking for a decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in glendale, this is the place to go.
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in glendale! buy one get one free any beer!!
the asada fries were amazing. didn't get drinks this time but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals are great and the prices are so affordable. def coming back!
great place with great service. &nbsp;the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around. &nbsp;great food also. &nbsp;can watch all sports games while having a great time.
this place is just ok. i went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was disappointed. some of the beer was on special but absolutely no food was on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special. nothing! lame.i can go to a bar one block away and get drinks and food at half price for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, 7 days a week from 3 to 7 pm.personally i won't go back to 'tavern on brand', but if you don't mind paying full menu prices for an average bar with average food and average service, go ahead and knock yourself out!
large tvs, perfect for watching the la kings dominate. lots of beers on tap and great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink specials, especially on the weekends. the food is meh.
i came here for the first time today for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;arrived at the end of soccer game and place was packed and full of energy!<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food was fresh and delicious (especially mushroom swiss burger and portobello fries). &nbsp;huge glass of sangria ($6 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>)! &nbsp;our waitresses, mary and jackie, were fantastic; they were cool, calm, collected and confident and took care of our group of 13 with separate tabs and no problems. &nbsp;way to go!!! &nbsp;definitely will come back here!!
while searching for the latest <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot to try in the glendale area, thanks to yelp i found out about tavern on brand's lengthy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 12 pm to 7 pm daily!!! my best friend and i ended up walking to the place (next to alex theater) and was impressed by the vast selection of draft beer (craft and non-craft) that were included in the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. for $6, we got 2 beers instead of 1! to me, that feature would make me want to go for more beers especially if i decide to stay at the tavern on brand for a few <span class="highlighted">hours</span> and watch sport games on tv. furthermore, the bacon wrapped shrimp with fries tasted crispy and delicious (despite of the hefty price), the ambiance was chill, and the service from the bartenders were excellent. they were friendly and attentive to their customers. overall, tavern on brand is a must if you want to enjoy cheap draft beer with company during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!! good beer on tap. great service!! bar tenders are really friendly and know their stuff on liquor!! will def come back
good selection of beers and cool <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ambience is cool too, but sometimes &nbsp;they're under-staffed and waitresses are sometimes not the friendliest.
1st time. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 2 for 1 on a big selection of draft beers. also great deal in wings for a wednesday. lots of tv's to watch sports. the wings are pretty good. wait staff was friendly and prompt. would go back
i love this place ! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is great !! wings are by far my favorite ! and the staff is super friendly ! best bar in glendale !
great service, staff personable and attentive. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 12-7daily ; 2for$6 drafts with a large selection. &nbsp;def comin back
i came here on a saturday afternoon for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;it was busy for the time of day. they do have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for drinks every day and drinks specials on top of that. &nbsp;we were a bit hungry so we ordered the sliders and buffalo wings. &nbsp;sliders were ok. &nbsp;the wings were good. &nbsp;the prices for the food seemed pretty high for the quality. &nbsp;i feel like maybe they should do some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food prices as well. &nbsp;service was decent.
a great bar with amazing food, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. &nbsp;love the atmosphere and it's a plus that they're kitchen is open late at night.
good selection of beers. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday 12-7pm. overall the food selection is good, way better than the previous management. ambiance is mellow during the day, gets crowded during game days. this is my go to bar in glendale. just a short walk away from the americana.
i recently made a reservation for a large group of 20 people at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i was very pleased with the food and service, and my group had a great time.we took up a long section of tables against the wall. the place is big, with plenty of space for large parties. our waitress was very attentive with our orders and we were served promptly. the two for one drink specials at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are really great. &nbsp;the burgers were good, and i loved the calamari topped with olives and feta cheese.everyone said they had a fun time. and i would definately come back with a large group again. the food, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks, and service were all great.
2-for-1 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, the game you wanna watch is always on, and rachel the bartender is bombskies
absolutely love this place we come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after class its great the deals on the cold beer are awesome as well as there food,we especially love the sweet potatoes fries
awesome place. the vibe is really relaxed and laid back and the staff is very helpful. especially the super helpful armenian guy. get here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or check out their other deals. it's a steal.
mary was so helpful! came here for the 1130-4 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and had no idea what to order! she helped me pick a screwdriver, made to perfection! great atmosphere :d
ok so this place is awesome for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i've never had the food here but will eventually. &nbsp;jackie was our bartender today and she made a killer dirty martini. not only did the manager/owner (not sure) make sure we were taken care of he saw to it that our bartender made it before the end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ambiance is good, i love a bar where you can't hear crickets... about 65% of the place was filled plenty of room to hang but still mingle. one of the few good places for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in glendale. thumbs up!
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and everyday specials in glendale! the waitress are the friendliest and they take the best care of you. this is our go to spot after work and for all the games. arthur will get you a parking spot in case you can't find one!
love love love tavern on brand!! you can't go wrong with 2 for 1 beers for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday from 12-7pm!! and a late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after 7pm. and $5 sailor jerry shots all day everyday! so many good beers to choose from.. food is bomb and service is great!! laura jackie cindy and brigs... you guys are the best!! :)this place is a must!!
this place is solid! &nbsp;2 for 1 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday? &nbsp;kidding me? decent beers on tap as well ... haven't eaten here but who needs food when you can just double up on the libations?
great after work <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot! beers are 2 for 1, and the seafood nachos are to die for. they also have a taco tuesday special ($10 for a beer and 3 tacos, i think) and a special on wings on wednesdays.
this place is awesome!! great food great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu large selection. the service is great amazing bartenders extra friendly favorite bar in town hands down !!!!
nice indoor bar. it gets quite hot at times. they typically have musicians come and sing covers. the staff is friendly. but expect a wait on drinks. their stuff mozzarella sticks are great! not greasy!*chorizo tacos are delicious! *taco tuesday!*<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for beers! 2 for 6$ gray variety*thursday special on a tower! it does get pretty loud so be aware. ^^
my friend and i met at tavern on brand to check out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.i liked the two for one deal on some of the beer. &nbsp;we both ordered the allagash blonde ale and it was very good, so we ended ordering a second one. &nbsp;we ended up ordering two orders of the edamame because that was something to eat that didn't contain lots of calories. &nbsp;it hit the spot.there is metered parking in front or a lot in back. &nbsp;you do have to walk all around the block to get to the parking. &nbsp;i would recommend walking with someone to your car if you park in back.
best place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> before 7pm...everyday! &nbsp;2 for 1 drinks everyday before 7pm!! &nbsp;the food is super good and the bartenders are always hot and friendly!!!
my friend wanted to check this place out upon the recommendations of yelp. i guess if you're looking for a cool <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot this will do, however the service and the food isn't all that great. one server came to ask for our order and we weren't ready yet, so we asked her for a little bit more time. 20 minutes passed by and she never came back. the food is overpriced and nothing special. if you're just looking to get drunk on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices, then this is the place for you! everything else, not so great.
i work up the street. this is the spot for me and my co workers mainly because of thr <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> specials. 2 beers for $5!? that's stupid cheap. good beers on tap. lunch special burgers are good too!
awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals, good food, and great music! bartenders are super friendly and attentive to customers. vahe (one of the bartenders) really knows his drinks and makes sure his customers are satisfied! i'm always here after work or on weekends. love this place! and their wings are amazing! must try!
good bar food and good service. &nbsp; great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials to boot! &nbsp;this is only my second time coming here, &nbsp;but i would definitely recommend it to friends. &nbsp; it's also a good place to catch the game, &nbsp;as they have about ten televisions.
tavern's that neighborhood bar that just feels like home-- and i don't even live in glendale! located on brand blvd (hence the name), it's walking distance to the americana and a bunch of other food places so that my fat ass can get my grub on before, during, and/or after hitting up tavern's seven <span class="highlighted">hour</span> <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!yup, 12-7pm <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> err day. loves it. $5.50 for 2 beers. no brainer! it's sometimes hard to get a server's attention, but they do the best they can. and they don't drag their feet when you ask for something, so that's a plus.
i love this place. a wide variety of beer on tap. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day from noon to seven, which means $3 beer. all of their beer. so if you are sick and tired of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> where they have only cheap crap beer (i will not start listing them, because you all know which ones they are), you have to try this place.
had an amazing experience at tavern. drinks are amazing and fair price. i would highly recommend trying this place. try their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for drinks. the nachos were also really good and fresh.
let me start by saying, i hate glendale. &nbsp;i hate it, hate it, hate it. &nbsp;so when my &nbsp;good friend decided to drag me here for her going away <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i was less than <span class="highlighted">happy</span>.to my surprise, i didn't hate this place at all. &nbsp;bountiful street partking (metered), parking behind the bar (also metered), nice waitresses and decently priced <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks. &nbsp;service wasn't super efficient, but pleasant. &nbsp;food was good for bar food and the crowd was pretty cool too. &nbsp;i was very surprised to find an easy going, laid back place anywhere in glendale. &nbsp;i would certainly return.
really like this place perfect for catching up on some sports. definitely &nbsp;go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> the drinks are a great price and service was great! my friend and i ordered the sampler plate that came with portebello fries ....these were okay not that great other than that i had a very good experience
good local bar with great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. drinks are 2 for 1 everyday from 12-7. their food is pretty good for a bar and decent selection of draft beers. we usually go here for low key night to watch some sports at good hh price.
excellent service, great food. always come here for a after work beer. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 2 for 6$ beer from 12-7 so that's plenty of time. some craft beer on tap but enough to get me coming back for more.
best spot in glendale when you need to unwind and just simply enjoy great food and drinks at a great price. the staff is amazing; very friendly and attentive. the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in glendale.
this isn't really my kind of place. a miniature sports bar is basically what this is. 85% men, so ladies if you're looking, you know where to go now! it is fun to go in and watch the laker games or other sporting events but that's the extent of it for me. the beer is okay. pretty standard stuff, a little &quot;adventurous&quot; with the shock top, blue moon, and fat tire. there are a few bottles of craft beer, but it would be better if they some kind of california brew on tap. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good, and they have drink specials every day of the week, like $2 margarita mondays or something like that. for me this will never be more than a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> bar.
nice atmoshore and trendy decor. have been there for ladies <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. food was delicious. &nbsp;we had a variety of different appetizers. i really liked the shrimp with wrapped bacon. service was friendly and attentive. place was full. always pass by this place but it was my first time there. enjoyed my time there. would definitely go there again.
atmosphere seemed nice enough, they had the game going on and all was well until the very end. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials (2 for 1) were advertised to us when we got there, so we got two beers. we had to leave and when we went up to pay, the waitress rang us up for two beers instead of one. when i saw the receipt, i asked her about the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special since it was clearly during the <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, but she said that i should have specified that we wanted to use the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal to redeem <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices! i went on to say that the deals were advertised for us when we got there, but she continued to say she couldn't reverse the transaction since she had already put it in. she offered two free beers, but they were of no use since we had to leave. it all seemed so bait and switch to me. i don't plan on visiting this bar again simply because of the customer service.
this place is the spot!! their service was on point, drinks were made to perfection, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals were like woww and the owner was a great down to earth guy. it was my first time going to this bar and i loved the vibe. the design of the bar itself is beautiful and most importantly they have up to date music loll that's number one for me . i will definitely be back and totally suggest you guys try this place out, guaranteed you won't be disappointed!!
i came here for lunch during a 49ers game. there were a lot of people inside watching the game but there were still some tables available which were all self seating. i was wondering how long before anyone noticed us but to my surprise the bartender saw us walk in and brought over menu's right away. they had a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special going so we ordered from that menu. i had the wings and a taco salad and my bf had the chicken torta and fries. my wings were fantastic but the salad wasn't so great. my boyfriend liked all of his food. our waitress was nice and remembered our order without writing it down. she always came to check on us, despite the full house. if i'm around during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in coming back!
if you ever ask yourself, &quot;should i go to the tavern on brand?&quot; i can assure you, the answer should be yes. &nbsp;here's the short list of reasons why:-<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> till 7-2for1 wells are $7-craft beers on draft 2 for $6-cool bartenders -great crowd -live music tuesday and thursday nights :dhave fun, i'll see you there!! cheers!
i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work with some coworkers. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal here is great. 2 for 1 draft beers and well cocktails is a great deal. we came here during a stanley cup playoff game so i can't fault them for what happened, but there were some bumps along the road for us. we found outside seating, but the patio is a little small so it got cramped pretty fast. we also had a hard time getting a waitress to come help us with our table. once we did get a waitress she had a hard time with our drink orders (partly our fault) but she also was having to bring them out in groups (again can't really fault her for that). i felt though that a bar of this size and nature should be able to handle large groups better. i didn't try their food, but i can say that for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beers this is a good spot. 48/100
garlic friesfriendly customersefficient serviceplenty of games on the tv's plenty of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and daily specialsyes! this bar/restaurant offers all of the above. note: all seats were taken by 6. they were showing the ducks vs. anaheim (finals) and the golden state warriors vs. rockets (finals). i'm assuming this is not the normal level of activity for a wednesday.
came here spontaneously on a sunday with friends. &nbsp;they have great specials and great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals and their $3 mimosas were quite good. &nbsp;we tried their chicken wings, quesadilla and margarita pizza and everything was typical of bar food and not bad at all. &nbsp;they do have some healthier options on the menu such as edamame and hummus but i didn't try it. &nbsp;tacos are only served on tuesdays which is a bummer.
i really like the tavern, especially during the week. its local, chill and great prices great vibe. their garlic fries are my fav &amp; hennesy is a great price. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are awesome, mon-fri there is a different deal! (:
they have an excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu filled with big options and good eats! &nbsp;..and of course great alcohol deals! &nbsp;their old school burgers were phenomenal, juicy and cooked perfectly, and a steal at $6 for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i added bacon and cheese for $1 each and it was so filling, i didn't even complain when the waitress forgot my salad-- thought she brought me fries which i didn't order... ok - it's a bar, the service and order accuracy is not their forte. &nbsp;having said that, they are friendly so you can't get too mad. &nbsp;back to the fries - delish! &nbsp;the ceviche was also surprisingly delicious and way better than expected-- this is a must order! &nbsp;drinks were good, place was cozy and environment was fun, can't ask for much more when it come to a local watering hole!
been here a few times. love this place. every time i'm in glendale i have to stop by to have a drink or two. they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which is great for a college student like me. their food is amazing! you guys have to try the nachos.
love this place. i go here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all the time. its never too crowded, just enough so there is a warm atmosphere. the food is ok, but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is what does it for people. &nbsp;they have tvs all over, whatever the big event is, they have it onthe bartenders are good (the best is rachel, shes super cool and very nice)i dig it
i just *heart* this place. it's right around the corner from my office so it makes for a great place to do the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> thang! i loveeee their wings!!! service is always great as well. a woot woot for tavern on brand
a bar in glendale! i'm stoked!so a &nbsp;co-worker and i were strolling to porto's for lunch.... when lo and behold we spotted a tavern, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, in glendale!...and at 12pm!!.... it was as if it was god sent we swooped on up on to the bar and and enjoyed the lovely 2 for 1 special! they are fairly new and need more staff. but i'll be a regular!!
popped in for a few quick beers before a company dinner. the bar itself is set up well with big screens everywhere and a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i was hoping to catch some college football but they had all the t.v's tuned to a ufc match. i'd come back for football and a burger that looked pretty damn good.
hey guys ! i'm a glendale native and i've been to every bar in downtown glendale. though there is only a few bars in the area id have &nbsp;to admit tavern on brand has some of the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials along with a chill environment. it's only a wednesday and i can't wait till friday !! .
hands down my favorite spot in glendale!friendly staff, great food/drinks( grilled chicken sandwich, burger&amp; portobello mushrooms are some of my favorites) my coworkers and i come here frequently for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;and we love it! thanks tavern for always making our experience an enjoyable one!
i love coming here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (or not). their beer selection is pretty good (some great ipa's) and i generally don't even drink beer. service was average but friendly, always fun running into people i know here, and the atmosphere is chill.
definitely want to come back to this place! we went on a sunday afternoon and it wasn't too busy at all. minus 1 star because we had our eye on some food that they had run out of (i don't remember exactly what it was now). they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which we definitely took advantage of-even early on a sunday!i love the look of the place-brick walls, open air in the front...my kind of place. we ordered shrimp wrapped in bacon with fries and it was superb. i'm sure on friday and saturday nights this place is packed; i would like to try it then as well as to just order food...looking forward to it!
no clue why this place doesn't have a higher rating, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing! 12-7 every day is 2-for-1 drinks, 2 beers for $5 and 2 well drinks for $3. shots are included too! the food is pretty good for a bar, the nachos are probably my favorite. they also have really good french fries and hot wings. haven't really tried anything else but at a bar, i think that's all you need. overall the service is pretty good, sometimes it can be hard to get the bartenders' attention when it's crowded but they do walk around making sure everything is okay. only downside is my favorite bartender left, the others are great but hope was definitely one of the best. first time my friend and i came here we had way too many drinks but she made sure we were okay and gave us glasses of water without us having to ask. if hope was still there it would definitely be a five star place, but the other bartenders are still great and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing. they also have drink specials after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ($5 jack and coke on fridays!) so it makes it one of the best bars around town!
*this review is based on my sunday visit at 5:30 pm. i will most likely be visiting at other times/days and will update my review if need be. i stumbled upon this bar while in the area and in need of a place to watch sunday night football. i'm still exploring the glendale area, but i can almost be certain that few bars will be able to beat it. first of all, i had to do a double take when i saw their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which, if they keep it going, will bring me back again and again. for six dollars you get two 16oz draft beers--no coors, bud light, or budwiser either. i am talking about great tasting craft beers that would normally go for six dollars a glass. best part of it all: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> goes from 12pm-7pm everyday.
i do really like tavern on brand. &nbsp;everybody that works here is always very nice and make you feel like a regular. &nbsp;however, the reason for the 3 star rating and not higher is because of the wait times. &nbsp;if you go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (which is really good by the way, buy one get one special till 7) you can expect to have to wait a while for service. &nbsp;not the fault of anybody that works here, i just think the addition of more cocktail waitresses would definitely help. &nbsp;i usually try to sit at the bar, service is a lot quicker! &nbsp;overall a cool place to go, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
i love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! cannot stress enough how great this deal is. wonderful drafts on tap -- all for $2.50/per beer! definitely a place i'm <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to recommend to others. they also have $20/towers on thursdays. what a steal!we watch games here, and there are usually pretty diverse fans of each team so it's a fun environment.
if you can find parking on brand and not screw up at the kiosk to pay for your parking... then go to tavern on brand for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...i did get a ticket even though i was parked and paid for, legally. had to submit my receipt to get out of it, so keep your parking receipt!asia and rachel were fun to be at the bar with! great conversations and lots of laughs!<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cant be beat and its better than some 2 for 1s that give you both drinks at the same time. when you finish your first, you will be served another. you pay for both up front and dont forget to tip! the place is good for watching sports and the patrons are from all walks of life. its an open air type place so i found it very comfortable.
since i moved here to glendale 3 years ago i have been going to this bar because they have specials every day and i like their friendly service. i would not go here for food other than appetizers because it is pricy. other than that they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as well.
i was there during a hockey game. the waitress was very friendly. the location is nice. i can't say too much because i was there not more than an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>, but it is more of a place to go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i'll probably go there again.
you can't beat an all-day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with a damn stick! love this place. bartenders are nice, food isn't great but i'm keeping my 5-star rating because i don't go there to eat. plus, i might still be drunk from the 2-for-1...
great little sports bar! <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> are great if you like drinking beer and well drinks (i stick to beer) - they also have additional daily specials that you see once you're inside (such as $1.99 margarita mondays).the bartenders are fun and attentive :-)appy's are a bit pricey for what you get, but they are delish! i would definitely come back here to watch a game again! nice, chill little spot, with an easy-to-speak-over soundtrack playing. good times at the tavern.
i used to live very close to here, so i was there a lot. all the staff is very friendly. it a good place to watch sports if you're into that. better be a lakers fan if they're playing. best part about this place is the ridiculously generous and loooong <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. noon to 7pm all drinks are 2 for 1. yep. crazy. i wish there beer selection was a little more advanced though, no real micro brews except one. this place gets busy on weekend in the evening.
joined friends for an after-party meet up here and it was a great spot. comfortable atmosphere, accommodating (yet very busy) staff. we had a ginormous party and we were taken care of efficiently. i only had half of an 895 (being a responsible driver, y'all) and snacked on what yelpers had suggested - garlic fries (i liked them, but didn't love them. they use oil vs fresh garlic). also ordered chicken tenders as they are our go-too for boozing nibbles but these were a bad choice...imagine soggy orange chicken minus the glaze. i heard the potato skins were killer though...next time. &nbsp; &nbsp;four stars for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu that i look forward to trying in the future (2 for $6 beers!) and, as i said before, for having great patience in serving large groups.
tried this place out for the 1st time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with some co-workers and found the place not bad. &nbsp;the place doesn't seem to get too crowded though. &nbsp;whether that's good or bad depends if you like a bar more lively or more subdued. &nbsp;place has a good selection of beers and a 2 for 1 special during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;tried some of their grub like the &nbsp;steak quesadilla, calamari, and hummus with pita - not bad, good enough for bar food. &nbsp;it's also good place to watch sports with all the flat panel tv's around the place. &nbsp;for the service, i thought the staff were really nice and friendly but i think they should hire more servers. &nbsp;the time we were there there were only 2 people serving the place, 1 bartender and 1 server. &nbsp;hence the somewhat slow service. &nbsp;overall, it's an ok place to unwind and get some drinks but not necessarily the most fun place to be in.

-food was delicious. &nbsp;it far exceeded my expectation for bar food-it was empty when i went but they are only a couple weeks old-friendly staff-i hope they get bigger selection of beer but their 2 for 1 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, 7 days a week, rocks!!i will definitely go again. &nbsp;finally a decent bar in downtown glendale!
excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>/daily specials. my boyfriend and i came in on $17 pitcher night. i belive it was a thursday. the food is good, we had the nachos (if they're on a menu, i order them) and we shared a burger (mexican burger?) with the garlic fries. <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fbomb.com&amp;s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bomb.com</a>. the ambiance is cool; dimly lit with some nice exposed brick by the bar.there was also some live music (there was more than one 90's song so i'm in). definitely our new favorite spot in glendale, we'll be back.oh, the po-po's were doing the rounds, so keep that in mind, especially if you're a lightweight like me. if i were the hammered chicks sitting across from us, i'd be worried.
great bar to really enjoy that afternoon drinking crave. also, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 12pm - 6pm every day of the week is really great!the best place in the glendale/burbank are to grab an afternoon drink. the drinks are after all 2 for 1.as far as the food it's great food...especially after some beers or some drinks the food is even more delicious.definitely check it out. my recommendation: it's a def. visit
wow, what a little gem! &nbsp;i had dinner with a friend at far niente, and found this place next door.drinks are good; a little heavy on the ice (i drink scotch). &nbsp;decent pricing for non-beer drinks. &nbsp;staff is friendly, and the whole place has a decent vibe to it. they have live music that isn't blaring like some other places i could name *cough* jax *cough*. &nbsp;and the place is packed during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;had some nice eye-candy to boot. &nbsp;=p &nbsp;definitely on my go-to list in the future.
bartenders chicks are pretty hot... the bar has happening music and there are always drink specials. &nbsp;they have a big variety of drinks and great attitudes. &nbsp;when your feeling like just kicking back and talking to some friends this is a great place to go, atmosphere is really great. &nbsp;they show all of the ufc fights and every sport game there is. &nbsp;you can always ask the bartenders to change the channel to anything basically.must go if your in glendale. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day from 2-7pm and various drink specials.
tavern on brand is my new favorite spot!! i came here one afternoon right when <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was about to end and the super cute waitress let us order to four drinks for the price of two even though it was 6:50. that was super cool. i ate the nacho that were super delicious and has that good spice to the cheese. i also got the club sandwhich and it was yummy. good atmosphere too. the tables were packed and it felt like a good crowd. will be coming back.
let me start by saying that 4 stars is the max for a bar in my home city of glendale. tavern is the best local bar in town. great <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, which i believe run all day to 7pm. i come here to have a few drinks so i haven't tried many items on their food menu, but i do know the lemon pepper wings are great. they also have many beers on tap, although i wish they would add smithwicks to their option. and if you like watching games, they have several tvs on the walls. overall a chill spot with an attentive and friendly staff.
only a couple bars in glendale that i would go to and this is one of them. &nbsp;very casual. lots of tv's to watch sports and 2 for 1 specials during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>... &nbsp;also bar fn is only a couple doors away so you can bone out and go there if it gets bad. &nbsp;garlic fries are good as well. &nbsp;service is good.
i am glad that i was finally able to visit this tavern.i'm a fan of bars that market heavily on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. everyday there is a new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> theme that will have you wishing you didn't have work the next day. pitchers and beer towers will engage your fellas and lady friends to premium brews at a cheap price. i unfortunately did not try the food but your eyes will wander from your hot date to a big hot plate.the bartenders are on top of their game to make sure their customers glasses are always filled. the dark paint on the wall allows you to see all 6 of their large high def flat screens. 21 draft beers and and even larger bottled selection will have you saying &quot;innie minnie miny mo&quot;.the place is a bit cramped only due to an awkwardly placed table in the middle of the bar but there is ample room for you to bring your small party. vip parking (street) is a premium but there is plenty of structure and neighborhood parking nearby. hmmm... i'm thirsty!
considering that in all of the city of glendale, there aren't very many bars in general around, this one, however, is conveniently located in the heart of downtown glendale. i remember passing by this place many times on my way to the pho hut but never stepped foot inside or checked their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing. they always have that sidewalk signage outside advertising their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. one day, i stepped inside with a buddy of mine and we ordered a couple of coors, a gin and tonic, and a bourbon on the rocks. i can't remember the exact bill but i remember it being fairly cheap, under $15 between the both of us. there was a special that day. apparently, we were allowed another well drink or beer for free because we had ordered a certain amount of drinks but we didn't take it. we still had the rest of the day of work to take care of so we couldn't exactly go back to work intoxicated. we went in around 5pm just an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> before their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends. it's quiet and chill and there are multiple flat screen tv's each playing one type of sport or another. this is the kind of bar i wouldn't mind coming more often for reading or work. not sure if there was wi-fi available but we did see two business ladies working on their laptops at the bar when we were there. one thing to note though, they didn't have very many things on tap. last time we went, they had bud light, corona, and something else on tap--probably a miller, if anything. everything else was in bottles. all in all, come here if you like a chill place to hang out and talk. mostly dudes come in to sit, drink, and watch tv so don't expect very many women to come through here.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good but service needs work. go during the day for better service, but at night the service sucks. the waitress gave me someone else's tab and said &quot;he's you're friend right?&quot; i said &quot; i don't really know him&quot; ( he was just part of the group i was with) and then she told me &quot;give it to him&quot; ... lady that is your job.
food and service was really good for a bar/pub, pleasantly surprised! husband and i were out shopping, i am pregnant by the way, and we needed food and hubby wanted an irish bar to start patty's day early with beer n jameson so we yelped here...so being prego, taste buds are picky, lol we really liked the saturday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger, and mmm lemon pepper and spicy wings! baked on amazing seasoning!
i came here with a few of my buddies and took advantage of their incredible <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, lots of beer, lots of food, i love the place. also, it was really happening for a tuesday afternoon, lots of fun crowds came in, we went for some food and ended up staying late and watched the dodgers game. &nbsp; &nbsp; really fun place, i will definitely go back and enjoy the delicious shrimp sandwich. fun atmosphere, nice location, great service.
i'd come here if i absolutely had nothing to do. the drinks are pretty inexpensive and the 2 for 1 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great. rachel is definitely the best bartender here and has hooked it up so many times. i've been to this place at least 20 times but that was such a long time ago. the parking is free after 10pm and the beer towers at tavern are awesome. the reason i give it a 3 is because the crowd can be questionable at times. also some of the bartenders can be a little rude at times and food isn't that good.
i don't know what i was thinking with my original review. this place is just aweful. the food is so bland and boring. and i can't prove it, but i think this place gave me food poisoning last wednesday. my stomach hasn't been the same since. the drinks are ok, and i guess the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials are ok. the service is just horrible. not the fault of the bar tender who has to run the entire joint by himself. but they are consistently understaffed here for the 4-5 years that i have been going. luckily, now with with moose den and other bars opening up these guys now have competition. these guys better step it up, because people are going to start realizing they are below average. below average doesn't work in the restaurant business.
been here once for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;they have a &nbsp;2 for 1 special with drinks. we both ordered vodka-sodas and felt short changed by the small glasses. i would stick to beer next time. the waitresses were also kind of into themselves. none of the food had any deals, which was surprising. but, i will say that their mediteranean fried calamari appetizer was outstanding. it is also a great place to watch sports as well, as they are loaded with plasmas.
i came here for a quick beer and bite to eat after a long day at work during the summer. best staff! all the bartenders are great! awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 7pm. i don't like mixed drinks but if you like hard alcohol they have a fully loaded bar with a creative list of cocktails. best beers on tap and very good food (not your typical frozen microwaved bar food). the workers here are quick and sharp. don't feel ignored if they storm past you. they will be back. they are just very quick and sometimes get super busy. but they always take care of you. i've never had to wait long for anything. they have lots of tvs if you're a sports fan. we come here to watch the kings games all the time. go kings go! they play good music too; usually reggae and dub which gives the place a cool vibe. overall, huge fan of this place and the staff.
it's almost 6pm on thursday february 6 and here i am at this amazing pub having a few drinks and some appetizers ( tavern hot wings and ceviche ) with my co-workers. all what i can say about this place is that they have a great food !! and the most amazing deal ever 12 to 7 <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> !!! &nbsp;( drinks ). i have never seen anything like this in anywhere else. almost forgot to mention most friendly staff !! ( bartenders/servers ).
this place has new ownership and the fine quality of this fine establishment remains the same. can't beat 2 for 1 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, the service is outstanding, and with the world cup coming up, this will be the spot to watch the beautiful game. there are tv's all over the place and true &quot;futbol&quot; fans can be found here watching uefa champions league games or other sporting events.

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> rocks. it's 6pm-8pm, monday-friday and 3pm-7pm on weekends. &nbsp;$2 off drafts. $2 off wine. $4 wells. crowd is good and so is the music and the bar-keeps are great.

great spot! food trucks(call ahead), great craft beer, dj on selected nights, awesome patio,board games and trivia tuesday's! &nbsp;excellent staff and great prices(especially for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>)
great beer selection plus bottles to-go until 2am. huge, well shaded patio, heaters when it's cold. lots of locals. suffers from the same problems all busy bars do: crowd can be lame on weekends and wait time for drinks can be an issue, but that's not on them. generally a pretty sweet spot to get some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks or spend an evening with a couple pals. food trucks pull up to the patio and there's lot of seating. bathroom game is weak. photo booth.
great local bar. the only one i can really walk to from my house in gp. amazing outdoor patio and hipster chillness without the attitude you find in silverlake. many drafts for $6 and they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> where drinks are about $2 off. best part is the outdoor patio which is great for huge groups and seats about 3 times as much as the inside. they also get good food trucks to pull up on weekends and serve munchies.
hungout here with a group of 8 and had plenty of seats and games to choose from. it was a saturday and the bar had a 4 dollar special on well drinks and 2 dollars of selected beers. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> lasted from 3 to 7. i will most like come back to this cool neighborhood bar.
this bar reminds me of austin. &nbsp;great back patio, long wooden tables, good music, laidback vibe. &nbsp;inside is dim and nice for more intimate conversations. &nbsp;but seriously, the back patio is where it's at.few specialty cocktails, but come here for the nicely curated beer selection. &nbsp;no food but looks like various food trucks come around and post up for a bit.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 6-8pm, draft beers are $2 off, with the exception of the last thursday of the month.
we recently went here for an oktoberfest event and can't wait to go back to try their beers on tap. &nbsp;they have a great outdoor area for the nice days and a spacious indoor area with dim lighting, perfect for those evening <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> or for a weekend afternoon filled with leisurely beer drinking.in addition, they have a great selection of beer bottles to go. &nbsp;go check it out!
i love this place, they have a good election of craft beer, the pricing is average normally 6-8 dollars a beer. i like their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good, they knock off 2 dollars every beer and all well drinks a 4 dollars which is fair. i also like this place a lot because they have events here all the time and they have food trucks park in the back every know and then to sell some good food!! they also play some good music on weekends and play movies at the bar. the manager of the bar is awesome also, really nice dude.
great european beer selection along with a nice outdoor seating. the bar is cool although a bit sticky. they could use a bit more west coast beers. i don't mind spending the extra buck for some high quality craft beer because that's all i drink but they are way to expensive. over $30 for 4 beers on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!!!
supposedly this is close to steven g's house. why i haven't run into him yet is anyone's guess. probably because he's too busy ordering beers that they have run out of to notice anything else. that's just a guess. ;)i've been here a couple of times during the week.i think i prefer when it's not too crowded just so that i don't end up like steven. &nbsp;the very last time i came was for a yelp event so i dont know if the prices were '<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>' prices or just for the event itself but my tab was less than twenty dollars for at least four drinks. nothing to complain about there.also, the bartender was extremely friendly and attentive, not to mention that i love the fact that they had rasputin beer on tap. yum. the day that i came they also had quite a few games for us to play - i think it was uno if i recall correctly. i think it would be funnier if we tried a hand at drunk twister but i suppose that's just me. good thing i'm not in charge of the bar becuase we'd probably end up with some tapioca filled kiddie pools, a couple of wrestling matches, wet t- shirt contests and a drunken spelling bee contest.
whaaaaat?! i've never written a review for my favorite bar in the world??? must.correct.immediately.verdugo is my dream bar. my home away from home. good beer, yummy food trucks, and a casual, friendly atmosphere. they've recently implemented a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which they didn't have before. they also do trivia now, but i haven't yet had a chance to go! recently, we were told that they were charging $1 to taste a beer, which was a bummer (i hope they've changed that!)other reviewers are right, the female bartenders can be unhelpful, especially if you're a woman. don't let them taint your experience. if you happen to be there on a night when the owners are there, you'll be taken care of. they love talking to customers, making sure you're enjoying yourself. they control their sound system with an ipad, and happily take requests, or will choose songs to match your mood.sunday patio sessions are awesome. jenga and connect 4!i love this place!
this was a chill spot that i found through yelp. nice atmosphere on the inside. i went with some coworkers on a monday and everyone had a good time. i enjoyed the take-home glass option for the select beer, plenty of street parking, fun local brew options and cool decor, decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices, and really diverse clientele.the bar is a little hard to find your first time (no big sign outside in a pretty residential neighborhood, with a tricky parallel street that is easily confused). i recommend google mapping with the actual street view. but once you find the place, its worth it.i was a little disappointed that the food truck was late to arrive, so i didnt get food with my beer because i had to leave before 8:30. *i know that is no fault of the bar, but just thought it was worth noting.overall good place, i could imagine this becoming my local go-to spot to bring friends.
this is a funny place, because it's a great day drinking destination with a fantastic beer selection, and then at night the lights dim down, a dj starts spinning in a booth, and suddenly it's a swank &quot;lounge&quot; location. (you know you've been hanging around too long and should probably go get some food in you if you see that transition occur.)i think i'd prefer the day ambiance to the night, but that's just how i roll. big sunny patios plus good beer and friends hanging out equals <span class="highlighted">happiness</span>. that said, it's a pretty chill place to get a drink with a date in the night <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, too... lots of excellent options from the full bar, with a few different specialty options up on the board (a special cocktail, a special beer on draft, a special bottle of beer-- they sell bottles to go, too... sweet!)
this place is the perfect if you're looking for a calm place to spend friday night. &nbsp;the best time to go is right when it opens at 8pm... staying as long as you like of course. &nbsp;it does start to fill up around 11, like most places. the bartenders and owner are so friendly and <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to be running their own business the way they want to run it. &nbsp;you can see it everything they do. &nbsp;specialty beer rotates through the taps and tasting is encouraged. &nbsp;they have also grandfathered one of two existing licenses allowing them to sell alcohol to go. &nbsp;the only other operating bar with the same license is incidentally another great bar, the golden gopher. &nbsp;after talking with the owner for over an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>, sampling cherry beer! white belgians! and ipas, he suggested a japanese white belgian to take home with me. &nbsp;so good, really. they also have a back smoking patio and plenty of space for big groups so you'll never feel cramped here. &nbsp;also, for some reason, their bathrooms are absolutely gorgeous (?) &nbsp; the first time i came i had the hardest time finding it as it is located in a very residential area and also because i arrived like, 30 minutes before it opened on opening day. &nbsp; a little bit over-eager, perhaps?
i'm writing this review based on my birthday i had here 3 years ago so bear with me &nbsp;:)when i was here there was a beer pong table in the back which i'm unsure if it still remains. anyways, this was my first go at the &quot;game&quot; to which an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> or so later i finally won, and could hardly see, so it was a good birthday for sure! this place is actually not badly decorated and has a great outdoor area, smoking included :)downside - if you don't get robbed, raped, mugged, murdered etc. getting here, bonus. this bar is in the shadiest of the shady areas, good old glassell park. sorry glassell but you are not where i want to be most of the time. please ladies, don't walk alone, i've seen some pretty sketching areas in my time and this one sky rockets close to #1 with a bullet... bad joke.i also have not experienced this place with the grill truck outside, so that may be also a bonus in <span class="highlighted">happy</span> time experience.all in all, once inside you'll forget the mad, mad world inside and enjoy yourself a drink!
verdugo, i love you. you're a little easy to miss (only a nondescript &quot;cocktails&quot; sign out front) on this non-nightlife-y glassell park stretch and can seem shady from the outside, but you never fail to brighten my week. verdugo's down the street from a park, and its neighbors are an apartment complex and a weird, fenced-in place (my buddies and i still haven't figured out what it does) that seems to do business at odd <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. slightly shady surroundings aside, the bar's interior includes a darkly lit but cute, tiny lounge area with limited seating and prohibition-era decor; another room with more seating; and my <span class="highlighted">happy</span> place: the big, badass patio area with picnic tables where people can play r-rated jenga. the vibe's chill, the beats are cool (sometimes djs will spin at night) and the bartenders are friendly/entertaining (big-ups to katie and wes!). it's a mostly hipster vibe but i've had no problems talking to all kinds of people here. my only gripes are that there's only one stall in the women's room and that it's sometimes tricky to get a drink when the place gets packed on certain nights (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). but the beers they have on tap, which change periodically, make it worth it. cocktails are good as well and sometimes you benefit from a random heavy-handed pour, wink wink. come thirsty, leave <span class="highlighted">happy</span>.
the-bigfoot-lodge-los-angeles
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> especially when lindsey is behind the bar. love the cabin feel. casual attire and atmosphere!
$5 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, low key and burning insense and jamming. &nbsp;the bar is dark and cozy with a fake electric fireplace.they have no food, and only one bartender, there is no server, so i set at the bar. &nbsp;you can order any food and have it delivered. &nbsp;i have had the pizza next door and think its great.oh <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> goes until 9!
good reviews must be written by regulars. although the bar itself is really cozy, the bartenders are arrogant and rude. &nbsp;very inattentive unless they know you. one jerk in particular stared at me while i finished my drink and then walked away. &nbsp; looked at me and my empty glass 2 or 3 times without approaching me . &nbsp;maybe <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is worthwhile but otherwise the beer is overpriced. as in $5 for a can of miller lite. snarky bartender-no extra charge.uncomfortable bar stools and the music is random and sucks for the most part. &nbsp;not coming back.i would scroll down and read the &quot;not recommended&quot; reviews. they're pretty accurate.
they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and a perfect for large groups. i brought a group of 20-25 people here on a wednesday evening. we basically had the whole bar to ourselves from 6-8pm. then people started piling in for trivia night. we stayed through <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> into trivia night, and had a blast. ps- get the toasted marshmallow drink!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday 5p-9p!!! includes old fashion! super chill place. &nbsp;no dress code, even flip flops allowed. near griffith park. no where crowded or empty on the saturday night. cabin lodge theme. good amount of booths. reminds me of liquid kitty in sm but themed, and more open space. chill vibe. beer night.
it was five stars until the band started playing. please, no.killer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 9. 5 dollar cocktails is hard to beat. decor is still fun, the cocktails are good (among the specialties, i tried and liked the girl scout cookie). there's a decent amount of seating especially if you arrive early. my wife and a friend shared a birthday party here and there was plenty of room.but yeah, no bands please.
this place has really gotten annoying. &nbsp;the bartenders are usually too busy being cool people to keep everyone well watered. the crowd can be a little &quot;x-treeem&quot;, if you feel me. but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is way long, 5-8pm.
cool drinks and a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the normal prices are a little high though if you ask me. the bartenders are hit or miss, i know the gruffness of it goes with the whole lumberjack theme, but it would be nice to see a little friendliness. the bar is really cool though and the tables are nice for a small group. i go here a decent amount so overall i have to say that i keep coming back for a reason. a california hipsters dream of what oregon is like?
i like themed bars but i'm not keen on this one. come to think of it, all bars are themed..huh, fancy that. i never really looked at it that way. so i like bars - i digress- from the first time and every time since, i've been waiting for the other shoe to drop with this place. like somehow, in a miraculous moment i will see why everyone loves this crummy joint. it was around 6pm and we were in the hood and thought, 'neither of us had been here in years, what the hell'. we ordered some beers and right off i was a little bummed to see that there was no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the bartender was pleasant and busied herself cutting lemons and stocking napkins. so much so, that she was not as attentive as one would anticipate a bartender to be given the lack of patrons. they have 5 beers on tap and no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...gezzz this place is boring. we finished our beers and tapped out. sorry folks, still not seeing it. ...ohh! but i really did enjoy staring at the flickering candle light bulb by the moonshine. i wonder if i can get some of those bulbs at home depot? ******holy bigfoot batman! so it turns out that this place allegedly has a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 5-8pm....i guess they just arbitrarily dole out cheaper drinks to selected patrons? i'm taking a star away for that. ******
you know what they say - bigger the foot, longer the lodge. okay that was dumb, but the bigfoot lodge has plenty of room and character to spare. variety of poisons? absolutely. good cranking tunes to drink to? hell yes (ramones, hank williams, incubus)! real raccoon head behind the bar? yep. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a saturday? uh -huh ( i was there around 7pm). just go and make sure you stand close to the urinal if you're a deer with a short horn. (you'll get it when you get there)
pretty much as good as it gets for the novelty factor. so campy and geeky inside, i feel like i've come home every time i walk through the door.the specialty drink menu is very unique, and i'd highly recommend trying at least one for experience's sake - i like the toasted marshmellow or girl scout cookie. there's also a pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 8 pm.
i used to love the bigfoot lodge...not soo much anymore...the drinks are typically $10 and small..the beers $5. however, they do have <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> were pabst is $2.50. that being said, if are an angelino and have not been here...u have to come at least once...this is just one of those places u have to go to. i also have to agree with everyone, this isn't a dive bar but it isn't a club. it's kind of something in between without the dancing. the bartenders (most of them) have been there for years.. and they are attentive.
i love this place but i miss the bingo night on sunday evenings.i stopped going so much since bingo left. mostly because the host roy created some of the best banter.but all in all a solid bar. the karaoke that was there was ok( they played favorites. i tipped ten dollars and we never got the birthday girl up to sing... kinda disappointed about that one.) there's not really a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> either. the bar is pretty pricey,and with no real good reason. i pretty much go here for the amusement of the decor for one beer then i leave. i do like that it reminds me of a kind of <span class="highlighted">happy</span> yet morbid splash mountain- minus the splash.
i like the decor. &nbsp;very rustic with a little true detective flair. &nbsp;antlers will do that, though. &nbsp;it didn't bother me. &nbsp;i think i may have missed the giant carcosa party, but that's fine with me.i got there pretty early on a friday. &nbsp;like 7 pm. &nbsp;it was pretty empty, which is fine by me. &nbsp;i like being in and out of bars before it gets too crowded. &nbsp;the bartender wasn't super friendly, but they usually aren't in places like this. &nbsp;not a minus. &nbsp;he was competent. &nbsp;the drinks can be pricey, so be mindful of that. &nbsp; the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are so good you just assume everything is gonna be &nbsp;dive bar prices then you get the bill.i'll definitely be back, though. &nbsp;of all the bars in this part of town, it feels the most grown up.
great atmosphere if you love the northwoods feel. it's dark like a good bar should be! it's not crowded at all if you come before 9pm on a weeknight. love that they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals and specialty drinks. the bartenders are some of the nicest people too. they know how to make quality drinks and won't ignore you like a lot of places when it's crowded. they have events almost every day of the week, like pinewood derby races, karaoke, movie night and pub trivia. hard to hear the questions if you're seated in the back though. i'm becoming a regular here because the bartenders are so sweet. they play good music and the crowd is never douchey. can't wait to go back!
hmmm. ok, i enjoyed the mechanical racoon and smokey the bear sporting a doobie...however i could do without the smell of shat that lingered throughout the lodge. at first i thought the raunchy smell was a specific person then i realized that it perpetuated every inch of the room. i truly felt like i was next to the portable latrine in the woods. i'm not trying to be a capital hater but something evil happened that evening....other than that...fun place to visit. it's a chill spot and a unique bar setting. i dig on the log cabin theme. i think this place would be an excellent friday evening <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot. rest your dogs people.over and out.
i am ambivalent about this place. &nbsp;on the one hand they have one of the best everyday <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> (5-9). &nbsp;on the other hand, it is overly hipster. &nbsp;and, the two simply cannot go hand in hand. &nbsp;the drinks: from good to bad. &nbsp;the first drink that was made for me was on par with the best i've had. &nbsp;yet, my second drink was haphazardly concocted and as such was not great. &nbsp;why the discrepancy, i do not know.the ambiance: it was great at first when very few people were there at around 8pm. &nbsp;mostly individuals holding booth for their later to arrive friends. &nbsp;at around 9:30 p.m. the place started to fill mostly with regulars - groups that seemed to know each other. &nbsp;the worst was having to contend with one gal dressed in a moose print dress wearing a davy crockett hat shrieking at the site of everyone she knew.if i ever do come again, it shall be between the <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of 5 and 9.
i used to have a drink at the lodge with friends quite regularly a while back. then we just lost interest. i have recently started visiting the lodge again, but mostly with friends who are from out of town. it is the cutest place you will ever have a drink! i love the rugged look of the place, and it reminds me of summer camp &quot;back in the day.&quot; they used to have a cute menu of drinks, and i guess they still make those drinks, but i don't see them advertised anywhere. girl scout cookie was my fave, but when i recently ordered it, it didn't taste the same (less of a &quot;thin mint,&quot; more &quot;toothpaste.&quot; bleh). now i just order off their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, or get a whiskey &amp; soda, which you can order anywhere, so i really just come for the cuuuuuute decor.service can be here and there, so that's not really a draw either. you'll have to wave down the bartender if the barflies have taken every seat at the bar. but it's a cool place to grab a drink after dinner at the tam o'shanter.
came here on saturday because a friend recommended it to me. &nbsp;seriously <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> form 5-9p, you really cannot go wrong! first of all, i loved the design, we felt like we were in the middle of no where, versus la. &nbsp;it is a fantastic escape that makes you feel like you are on a mountain getaway. &nbsp; we got there a bit early, coming from dinner, so it was relatively calm at that point in the night (9pm). &nbsp;for 4 drinks, i have never paid so little and, yet, was so satisfied with what i received. &nbsp;the bartenders know what they are doing and make drinks that are a good balance between alcohol and mixes; which is hard to find, it's usually one or the other. &nbsp;when we were just looking for our specific bartender to make sure we got our last <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks in before the 9p cut-off, we missed him by a minute. &nbsp;but, he still gave us the hh pricing, which was super awesome. &nbsp;if you are looking for a good, low-key hh in the city, this is definitely an epic place to visit.
i dig it.a place that gives love to the real california - the woodsy, outdoors, campfire, mountains california that i am in love with right now -- and all with that &quot;campy&quot; feel.if you haven't guessed yet the decor gives the feel of having walked into the middle of a redwood. it's long and fairly wide with different seating -- booths, bar and chairs make up your choices.and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! two dollar beers, six dollar jwr&amp;cokes...<span class="highlighted">happy</span> :-)the bartendress that served us was also pretty cool although there weren't too many people there and still she laxed on our cocktail refiills. i am excited to go back and try one of their specialty cocktails, like the one topped with a roasted marshmallow or the girl scout cookie and maybe i will have some adult-campfire stories to tell. ;-)
i love the atmosphere here. &nbsp;the decor is great and reminds me of home and it is always packed. &nbsp;their drink specials are delicious, you definately need to try the girl scout cookie and the smores ones. &nbsp;i also am a huge fan of their collins because they make it with lemon juice instead of just soda water like alot of other places do. &nbsp;it has less of an ambience at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but i would recommend it because some their signature drinks are half price and they are a little pricey late night. &nbsp;make sure not to come to late or you will not find a place to sit, this place gets crowded.
thanks bigfoot lodge for playing host to my going away party last month! *awwww the memories*anyway, given some of the amazing reviews, i had really high expectations for this place. i have to admit that i was a little disappointed. we got here early enough to catch their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (which is available on saturdays too!) but only had like 5 drinks (pretty lame selection) on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. so i wasn't all that thrilled.later in the night i got to try their more signature cocktails beary mule. girl scout cookie, and the s'mores. they were pretty pricey at $10 or $11 in my opinion.i liked the beary mule a lot (not for those who hate ginger) but the other two hyped drinks weren't that great. for some reason i thought that the s'mores drink was one of those drink as its on fire kind of thing. but its not.....sadface. also the bartender totally burnt my marshmallow rendering it inedible. the venue itself is pretty chill. not that large, but also not one of those teeny tiny bars. lots of seating that become unavailable as the night goes on. the theme is obviously their selling point and i enjoyed the festive atmosphere. even the bathrooms made me feel like i was in a public park bathroom (is that a good thing?). there was also some random eggroll foodtruck parked outside. sadly, no dj like i read there would be. no jukebox either...which was weird considering i heard some songs on repeat here.overall pretty nice bar. i'd definitely come again just for the theme's sake. there's also plenty of street parking. score!
this place is awesome! the drinks are strong and cheap, around $8 but they are made pretty stiff.... and in some cases they are on fire!.... <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great here and contrary to what people say it isn't smelly, it smells like old wood...so its not that horrible....the bartenders are really really nice and the people there aren't pretentious at all, its a pretty mixed crowd which makes everyone feel like they belong...plenty of seating and the decor is cool, who doesn't like wilderness creatures on the walls?....its a nice place to sit and chat....ive been there plenty and definitely plan on going back. :)
i come here on sunday nights every once in a while for bingo, and it's seriously the best time around! a good sunday involves showing up for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which ends at 8pm (i think?) then heading down the street for some del taco, and then back to bigfoot for bingo at 9!! you can win free shots, free beer, free mixed drinks, free drink memorabilia (jaeger t-shirts anyone?), and whatever random crap they have lying around (fax machine, geek stuff, etc). their drinks are great (i recommend the dudley do right if you're not scared of a sweet-tasting multi-shot extravaganza), and though their beers on tap have recently suffered a blow (according to the boyfriend and his beer-drinking friends who loved one of the beers they got rid of) i'm confident they'll bounce back.
i really liked this bar. the atmosphere was great, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (5$ shots of jameson) was awesome. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i got a little drunk and when we paid the bill for some reason it didn't occur to me that my friends had given the bartender cash so i saw what was being charged to my card and tipped appropriately for that amount rather than the entire amount of the bill. the bartender brought it to my attention and i apologized profusely and added to it but she was really not understanding or cool about it and still wasn't satisfied with the extra 20$ i gave her (which totaled to 25% tip). it just gave me the impression she was super fake nice to us the whole time we were there. staff counts for a lot and i don't want to go back there if i know that girls working.
the cheesy decor and mythical name alone should get you to come in. what's next, &quot;lochness cocktails&quot; or &quot;sasquatch bar&quot;?upon entering this place you feel like, &quot;damn, it feels like i'm in a movie with will ferrell and at any moment someone is going to do something stupid.&quot; and then it happens! somebody drops their drink on themselves. yes, right on cue.the drink are okay. the servers are really quick. the dj sucks but whaddya expect? personally i wouldn't mind seeing big foot himself turn this place inside out like it was a bloodier version of wrestlemania, but i digress. the beer mugs are funny. it really gives you that lodge feel with their beer mugs. the crowd appeared to be a bunch of unshaven men that night. i don't mean five o'clock shadow but full on beard going on. i guess they're training to be mountain men or something. sweet. maybe the u.s. forest service can come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and make sure yogi bear doesn't take any picnic baskets. the women looked pretty taken and disgusting. thanks for throwing yourselves on those grenades bearded guys!this place is alright with me since it is such an oddity.
not too often will i write a review for the same restaurant at a different location, but for some reason, i find it appropriate for bigfoot lodge. &nbsp;i've been to the other one (the newer one) i believe, and by chance, my friend was in town and staying at an apartment complex only a block away. &nbsp;nice. &nbsp;we have to go. &nbsp;i love bigfoot lodge, i really do. &nbsp;the decorations, the set up, the drinks, i love everything about it. &nbsp;this one even had forest creatures popping out of logs and trees and such. &nbsp;whoa. &nbsp;amazing. &nbsp;we were here for karaoke night which is interesting and fun. &nbsp;people just wanted to have a good time, and one was definitely had.our bartender, kristin, was amazing too! &nbsp;she was very friendly and always there when we needed another drink. &nbsp;bartenders like her are often hard to come by in los angeles, or anywhere, really. &nbsp;i always go with the toasted marshmallow genius drink. &nbsp;excellent. &nbsp;they do have beer here, but i always like to see what else is available too, especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;this smokey moonshine was pretty great too, and will get you feeling it more than soon enough.bigfoot lodge is worth it. &nbsp;i love it. &nbsp;so so good. &nbsp;still haven' found bigfoot though...so epic.
god knows i am a sucker for themed bars. but this place earns its stars for more than the decor, which includes a 'fire'place, mounted animals on the walls, a carved wooden bear on the bar, and large footprints outside the entrance. the bartender, whose name i didn't catch, but who had long black hair and looked a little morose (though engaging enough), pours with such a heavy hand you'd think you're really in the woods at night and the only thing to keep you warm is the fire in your belly he's supplying.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> runs from 5p-8p, $1 off anything. my boy got smokey's moonshine, a shot of fruit infused liquor served warm-this will knock you on your ass if you drink the sweet concoction on an empty stomach. &nbsp;i had a sasquatch, wild turkey, ginger brandy, ginger ale, and bitters served on ice in a tall ass glass. seriously, the glass was taller than me and i had to bend the straw in get in there. the bartender filled said glass with 3/4 booze but i was in the bathroom at the time, enjoying the reading material on the stall door, so i came back blissfully unaware that i was about to get buzzed off of an inch of tasty drink. wowee. the moonshine was $4 (!!!!) and mine was a worthwhile $9. &nbsp;music on not djing days is nostalgically awesome.
(drank 05/10/13 f @ 6pm): the only hairiness i saw was the facial kind found on the collection of hipsters here!my buddy and i took a couple weeks off from our weekly <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> excursion (which usually happened on mondays) for various reasons, but it was back on this friday night and i needed a place that had later <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> because of work, and the bigfoot lodge fitted the criteria. another friend was able to join so it was a party of three!we each arrived within minutes of each other and grabbed a cushiony leather booth directly in front of the bar - location, location, location! the bigfoot lodge had daily <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 5pm-9pm with a very limited drink menu (only five drinks), but the drinks were priced at $5.00 each so dammit i was going to work it, and we all did!:bigfoot collins ($5.00 x 2) - i started the evening on a light foot with this concoction of bombay gin, lemon juice, simple syrup and a splash of perrier. this definitely has a sweetness to it from the syrup but overall truly refreshing. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=21y-quyvgvkxcreyzbtqjw&amp;userid=8jvt2inwc8giq6sh2ug9vw">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>gimlet ($5.00) - next up was this mixture of vodka, lime juice, and simple syrup. again, a light drink but this time not as sweet and a heavier pour of vodka; thank you! however, a bit too much ice for my taste. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=g5qlplr-88bznkvkb8mcra&amp;userid=8jvt2inwc8giq6sh2ug9vw">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>old fashioned ($5.00) - i'm not necessarily a fan of this drink which consisted of bourbon, bitters, simple syrup and for show a flaming orange zest (but only lasted for a second!). the strength of the sweetness was back but in this case it defused the taste of the bourbon a bit which i liked. my buddy thought it tasted too much like black licorice. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_is3uc5y2zu3hlahis-7aw&amp;userid=8jvt2inwc8giq6sh2ug9vw">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>tullamore dew ($5.00) - i've never tried this irish whiskey before, and although i enjoyed it neat and sipped it lovingly, this one almost did me in, so after i polished this off we went next door to grab some indian food takeout and brought it back. <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ot7cbmo9w98w87ukhzr2nq&amp;userid=8jvt2inwc8giq6sh2ug9vw">yelp.com/user_local_phot…</a>scrimshaw pilsner ($5.00) - i needed something to wash down my indian food and this was the last item to try on their &quot;$5 buck <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; menu. i liked this lighter beer and actually went well with my food.service - it was great since it was still relatively empty. we had a clear path to the bar to place our orders and the cute pigtailed female bartender who wore a ymca indian princess vest (i knew this because of my nieces) was quick with our drinks and even brought them to our table one time.parking - they don't have their own lot but there was plenty of metered street parking ($2.00 - $1.00/<span class="highlighted">hour</span> but free from 8pm-8am) as well as the side streets.overall, this review was a longtime coming for the bigfoot lodge as it's been a favorite of mine for some time and a great place that my friends and i hung out in. although they didn't serve food, it was way cool that they allowed outside food to be brought in. and, apparently a food truck would show up later in the evening. i found great value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (total bill was around $30.00 before tip), but the hh prices were hard to beat and even the regular prices weren't bad either. the atmosphere, d&eacute;cor, and ambience was a rustic dark log cabin with a wilderness motif. there were leather booths and couches as well as bar stools and sitting cubes that surrounded the faux fireplace towards the back. the tables were of sectioned tree cut-offs and the bar also had a similar design. there were random stuffed animal heads, national forest signage, and other woodsy memorabilia. there were no tvs but there was background music which we managed to here the loop all the way through. the attire was totally casual so normally i would've been in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops. and they accepted my credit card of choice...amex!
so, i've lived across the street from this place for more than 2 years, and i finally made it in about a week ago. the decor was charming(gotta love the near-life-size smokey the bear!) and the music is 80s! gotta love that too! but, the drinks were unremarkable and it is a little too loud for my taste. i like to be able to hear my friends at the neighborhood bar, its not like this is a vegas dance club. the clientele is also hit or miss. on the night i was there, there was a pretty raucous bachelor party (i was deaf for the rest of the night from their obnoxious whistling) but i guess that can happen at any bar. but, all in all, it was a cool place, but i'll probably frequent it for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and not on saturday nights anymore.
shocking as it may be, i am not really an outdoorsy kinda girl. yes i was a girl scout and i can sell cookies and pitch a tent with the best of them( though the uniform has a whole different look now, i gotta tell ya). i can appreciate nature as long as i get a hot shower and a warm campfire to snuggle by.that's why this kitchy bar is so great, you get the fee-ling of being in the outdoors in some rustic cabin without actually hiking or getting dirty.i personally love a themed bar and this one definitely has a sense of humor about itself. no i dont love stuffed heads on the wall, but... seven grand has the same thing going on, just sayin'. eh, i was &quot;probably&quot; too buzzed to let that part of the ambience bother me for long.i personally think the drinks are good, the &quot;girl scout cookie&quot; was delish ( even though austin said it &quot;looked like paint&quot;) but by far, the &quot;toasted marshmellow&quot; was my fave. i mean they toast a marshmellow in your drink people, what else could you want ?( be forewarned it has 151 in it among other things and it'll kick yo' ass).obviously the sexy bartender uniforms have already been mentioned by other reviewers but uh...lemme tell ya no scout i ever saw looked that freaking good. i had a fantastic time with my fellow yelpers, what a great way for a girl to spend her drun...uh birthday. loland yes, part ii will be held at the strip club down the street.wonder if they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>? ..
it was one of those days where things just happened, and an ever-increasing-in-size group found ourselves here on a sunday evening. bigfoot lodge is smack dab in hipster headquarters, yet is is as unpretentious as can be. we parked at the free meters, seated ourselves on the big, cushiony barstools, and nerded out with the super cool bartendress. it was comfortable enough that we stayed for <span class="highlighted">hours</span> (and drank for <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, which made for a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad monday).i had been to this bar's westerly cousin, bigfoot west, and was pleased to see many of the same drinks. and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on weekends! all drinks were $5. i started with an old fashioned, which is one of my favorites in general. it was smoky, sweet, and came with a flaming orange peel garnish. if you like being drunk and watching things burn, staring fascinated at the fire through your boozy haze, this is the bar for you. the toasted marshmallow cocktail with the flaming marshmallow garnish is another one of my favorites, as is the green, minty girl scout cookie. both are sweet, but pack a mean punch. beware, because we all sure got punched. we had a great time, drinking, chatting, inviting more friends out, getting to know the bar staff, and ordering one too many drinks. el flamin taco is walking distance, too. the bar doesn't serve food, but they are cool about patrons bringing their own in.i don't give out 5 stars liberally, but i had a great time!
i was standing at her bedside and clutching her hands, moments before my grandmother died. &nbsp;as the tears stubbornly slid down my cheeks, i tried -- through the mumbled resonance of her voice -- to listen intently on her last words.&quot;grandson,&quot; she said. &quot;make me proud. &nbsp;make sure you always study hard, and do your best to be at the top of your class. &nbsp;make sure whatever you decide to do, you do it with passion.&quot; &nbsp;her big, plump feet stood firmly erect, and peeking out of the bedsheets.&quot;i will grandma faye....i will.&quot;soon after, her eyes turned flaccid, and her grip softened. she had passed on. &nbsp;those words, immortal, have been etched in my mind ever since.it's been 20 years hence, and i have taken it upon myself to make grandma faye proud by seeking and finding the best pubs in the los angeles area. &nbsp;&quot;why, yes!&quot; i thought to myself. &nbsp;an idea to be marveled by most! &nbsp;after all, it was at one of these gin joints that my grandma met my grandfather. &nbsp;i'm sure she's looking down at me from heaven, with a smile on her face and a nod of approval.of course, when my grandfather passed on, his last words were &quot;don't be an idiot!&quot; &nbsp; so, who am i kidding? &nbsp;it was my excuse to drink beer...with a passion.this very passion, and my thoughts of grandma faye, led me to the bigfoot lodge. &nbsp;what makes this all the more ironic and interesting was my grandma faye's fascination with the legendary bigfoot. &nbsp;whether it had anything to do with her own feet was no concern of mine. &nbsp;but i knew me being here made total sense. like...it was meant to be. (but you should also know that the thought of a good brew gives me romantic notions, so take what i've said with a grain of salt.)the bigfoot lodge looks like a cabin at some ski resort. &nbsp;my grandma faye was an avid skier back in the day, as tales were told. &nbsp;kismet? &nbsp;the long, narrow bar features a fireplace near the back, if feng shui is at all a concern to you. &nbsp;it's not to me, so let's focus on the beverages.there's an array of beer on draft, consisting of hefeweizen, guinness, newcastle, pabst, and stella on tap. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 3 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> every day, between 5 and 8 p.m. &nbsp;of course, when i'm not feeling plebeian, i sometimes opt for their signature drinks. &nbsp;i personally like the &quot;sasquatch&quot; -- wild turkey, ginger brandy, ginger ale, and a &quot;dash of bitters,&quot; and the &quot;dudley do-right&quot; -- canadian club whiskey, amaretto, cranberry juice, and lime juice. &nbsp;but sometimes i don't want to spend that much, so i'll stick to the pabst if a night of heavy drinking is on order.as i got drunk off the cheap pabst, i couldn't help but think that my grandma faye would be proud. &nbsp;i had just seen beerfest and i was living the american dream -- to drink beer and make it matter. &nbsp;in my case, it was all for the g-faye.this place is a &quot;throwback&quot; bar in every sense of the word. &nbsp;if i had been of beer-drinking age in the 70s, i'm thinking this would've been the rendezvous spot for me and my friends. &nbsp;not once did i have a bad time here, and i've always managed to strike a conversation with the amiable, but consistently busy, bartenders.my first time here, an ex-girlfriend bought me a shirt as part of my birthday present. although we are no longer together, i still wear that shirt often. &nbsp;wherever i go, people comment on my shirt and notice bigfoot the bear on the back. they'll say &quot;your grandma faye was a sweetheart of a woman.&quot; &nbsp;i scratch my head and wonder what they're talking about, and why.and then it makes sense.
bigfoot spotted at the bigfoot lounge! my bad; that just my girlfriend's feet. no really, bigfoot was really spotted there. no, that's just a drunk nude robin williams. joking besides, the bigfoot lounge is a pretty unique bar to find in los angeles &amp; san francisco. sadly the one in sf, closed. &nbsp;i have been to both of them. you can say, the place is ill with cabin fever. it's look like something made out of lincoln logs. full of stuffed mounted animal that would make peta angry, the place has this old west or deep south/ european black forest decor look to the place. actual polished wood bar and tables, dark leather chairs, mason jar string lights, forestry. sadly, it's a bit too dimly. i do have to say, sporting a fireplace is a plus. honestly, it's just as rare to see, a bar like this, in such in a liberal area like los feliz. like the ultimate hide &amp; seek champion, sass-quath, this place is yeti for a party! as of this date of writing, this is the menu. first off, there is the classics like bigfoot old fashioned (buffalo trace bourbon, demerera sugar, angostura bitters with flamed lemon peel) for $11. the lodge mule (russian standard vodka, flesh lime, home-made spiced ginger beer, bitters) for $10. saza-squatch (bulleit rye, peychaud's &amp; angostura bitters, pernod rinse, with orange peel.) for $10. &nbsp;there is a number of draught beers for your harry and the henderson's type of family to pick from, ranging in price from $7 to $9. example of these drinks are allagash white, scrimshaw pilsner, murphy's stout, golden road ipa, golden road brown, unibroue la fin du monde (12oz). let's say, you're more like a can or bottle person because you're a wookie drinker. well, chewbacca, they got the drinks for you. &nbsp;pabst blue ribbon, bud light, corona, anchor steam, amstel light, shiner bock, boddington's, stella artois, xingu black lager, wyder's pear cider, chimay red, o'douls, and others for prices ranging $4 to $12. let's say you want to have a boogie night with the goofy movie staying alive bigfoot. well, there are drinks to last all night long, with roasted 'schmella (bacardi rum, 1921 crema liqueur, ferner branca, honey syrup, and a roasted up marshmallow) for $11. yes, roasted up marshmallows on fire!!! oaxacan campfire (del maguey vida mescal, espolon silver, fresh lime, chili-infused agave nectar) for $11. last is the bigfoot's hairy fire balls (fireball cinnamon whisky, fresh lemon, honey, angostura bitters, house-made spiced ginger beer) for $10. big foot has a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ($5 specials until 9pm). the bartenders are dressed up like sexy, boy scouts and girl scouts. scout honor, they honestly look pretty charming in those uniforms! i just waiting for ed norton from moonrise kingdom to show up to join them. &nbsp;do ask the bartender about their sasquatch &amp; smokey beer + shot combo for $10. the places always host some type of event, from having live band music playing, dance night, trivia night, bingo night, pine car derby, stand up acts, and karaoke nights. if you sing 'oh, i'm a lumberjack, and i'm okay' on karaoke night. it will make my night. there are several large circular booths, good for groups of like 5, maybe 6, plus additional seating. comfortable floor pillow. there is an animatronic oddly place smoky the bear at the entrance for some greatly need bear hugs during smoke breaks. just don't tell, joe camel that he's taking his job. smoking are outdoor area/ patio only. still, a lot of people that come in there, have really bad odor when coming back from smoke breaks. they smell like death. the patrons depends on which day, you go are pretty mellow. i say, it's mostly a 21 to 45 age crowd. most of the time, they're friendly, but you do get a few alcoholics and asses, there to start problem. you do get a lot of hipsters, here. (after all, it's la). the restrooms are hit or miss in the clean department, depending on the days, you go there and how busy. street parking is always available and safe. still, on busy nights, it might be hard to find parking. women's restroom are supposed to have 2 clean stalls, plenty of toilet paper, paper towels, and 3 mirrors. men's restroom are supposed to be just as clean. dear readers, the bathroom are label &quot;doe&quot; (women) or &quot;buck&quot; (men) so don't you get confused. you go into the wrong room, you're road-kill. &nbsp;talking about doe &amp; bucks. credit cards are welcome. overall: it's worth checking out once. it beats going to the other bars near the area. at less, this one has a nice theme to go with it.

quiet, great place for good conversation and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals on beer with friends!
came for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. nice decor and decent prices on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks. had the grilled cheese and it was pretty good. the french fries were nice with a hit of basil maybe sprinkled on top.
stopped in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with my son. had a few beers, the fried cheese curd (savory cheesy deliciousness), and asian chicken wings (excellent ). all from <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. food was fresh and fast. beer was uh.. beer! &nbsp;and no complaints about the music. &nbsp;check this place out!
love this place for great craft beer, amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices and the bartenders are awesome, melissa and chris, they make it such a great time.a must check out if you are ever in the chino hills area
good drink specials for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and awesome food options. good place to go on pre or post plans. kinda hidden but it's a gem.
love this place! the menu has a great selection of food. everything taste delicious and has a high end flare to it. the tri tip sandwich is really tasty. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> you can get $3 beers, wine &amp; cocktails. the food for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a little pricey $7 or the amount you get. the portions are small so you are better off ordering from the regular menu for a few dollars more and &nbsp;a lot more food.
i went on a saturday afternoon after i saw the great reviews on yelp. i was really hungry so i guess i was expecting it to be really delicious. well, i found out that they have a pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during all nfl games. sweeeet.. we first started out with the avocado hummus and buffalo chili cheese fries. the flavor of the buffalo chili cheese fries was different and a little salty. however, it was still pretty good with a decent portion for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the avocado hummus was amazing and so delicious!! &nbsp;then we got the buffalo burger, and it was pretty good but not amazingly delicious. it was a little on the salty side. overall, i think the pub has a lot of potential, and i look forward to trying more of their foods. everyone in the area should try this place out!
food: i had the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> fish and chips on a recent visit. the fish was expertly cooked: crispy in the outside, flaky and delicious in the inside. the chips were seasoned beautifully.atmosphere: as mentioned, i was there during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (around 4:00-5:30 on a weeknight), so it wasn't packed. the crowd that was there came for the thursday night football game. seemed like a nice enough place to enjoy the game and have a beer.service: no one was there when we walked in. grabbed a table, someone came out about a minute later and brought menus. food came out quickly after being ordered.price: this is where it loses a star. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu consists of about 7-8 items for $7 each. the fish and chips includes only one piece of fish. there is a pub burger, or a grilled cheese, but neither of these include fries. if you want fries, it's basically the normal menu price for a burger and fries. so other than the price being a little high in my opinion (even for a &quot;gastropub&quot;), nice little place. i won't be back though because i can get the same food elsewhere cheaper, in my opinion.
we deff needed a spot like this here. &nbsp;close to home a plus to unwind after work. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> begins again at 11 to close i think. &nbsp;staff is nice the menu had a great variety of dishes. casual dress. they also have nfl sunday events. will def be back.
giving this place 2.5-3 stars due to lack of service! went here last night with friends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. food: yummy! everything we tried was pretty darn good. drinks on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is meh. they didn't have a couple of the beers that were listed so you're stuck with one choice...dos equis.service: blehk! this place would have gotten 4 to 5 stars if it hadn't been for the service. our waitress was pleasant (i say pleasant because she was somewhat nice but she never cracked a smile....she had a sour-puss face all night long) when we were ordering drinks but as soon as we said we were good, she was nowhere to be seen. it literally took 30 minutes to find her, get our bill, pay and finally get the receipt. really?
came in for a quick drink, the bartender melissa was awesome she not only made the prefect jack and malibu but she was super friendly and made my experience there a fun one! and i am excited to go back and try out there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>:)
my wife and i tried breakfast this morning (sunday) after having checked out <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on friday night. &nbsp;for breakfast i had duck chorizo hash and she had eggs and house made fennel sausage. &nbsp;bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's were available for $10. &nbsp;although we did not partake, those who did seemed pleased. both breakfasts were terrific, as was our <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> experience and dinners. &nbsp;we started <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with avocado hummus, warm spinach dip and the charcuterie cheese plate. &nbsp;for dinner, i had the pub burger; she had pappardelle with bologna &amp; shaved parmesan. &nbsp;generous portions and excellent quality. &nbsp;there is a full bar and good beer selection. &nbsp;friendly service. &nbsp;love this place.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was great. the burger was the correct medium rare doneness. interesting new stone beers on tap. the bartender chris was very welcoming and worked hard to make sure everyone (including us with a 18 month old) were well taken care of. he worked to find a beer that we loved offering samples without having to be asked.this is a great place that keeps getting better and better. great food and family friendly. if you are in the area come out to support it.
the service here is outstanding! it does seem like an odd location since you're driving with nature surrounding you for awhile but it's in the same plaza as wahfles. checking in will get you free spinach dip ($8 value) with refills on the crostini coming at you for free. come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for an even better value. there's a small but decent selection of beer too. great place to relax
came in here because i had purchased an amazon local deal for two beer flights. it was a thursday afternoon and there were hardly any people there, which is always a plus because you always get good service that way. ordered our beer flights no problem. also got the chicken wings and jamaican beef from <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. i really liked the jamaican beef thing it was like an empanada and croissant mixed together. definitely be going back here and trying the rest of the menu
we love this place! bartenders are friendly and fun! food is good and great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals. we had the spinach dip, pork belly bites and the hot dog. all were very good! this was our second time here and i know we will be back. this area needed a place like this and it's nice to support independent places. hope everyone supports this place. it's so much better than a chain restaurant.
have been going to this restaurant the past few weeks and absolutely love the food, the service and the drinks. beer selection is really good. love the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu for drinks and food. the servers fitria, liz and the bartender chris are excellent. highly recommend this place!!!
luv the pub! new to chino hills and found this lil gem enjoyed the pork belly bites and the bacon wrapped hot dog! great citrus craft as well. the patio view was also a nice treat. i cant speak about the dinning service or that food. my experience was laid back, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> time and i recommend to all my clients at work.
my hubby and i just ate here for lunch today. i had the tri-tip sandwich and he had the chicken breast, both items were from their lunch menu and both tasted great! i also purchased a groupon voucher which was only $11 for 2 entrees. what an excellent deal!! i cant wait to come back for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 3-7pm and also to try other food/menu items! the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly!! i will be back!! :)
i came in here with my fiance on friday 2/21 for dinner and drinks. we had just missed the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cutoff. chris was our server and he was very attentive and personable. he made the dining experience an enjoyable one. &nbsp;i used to work in the restaurant industry and there is nothing worse than a server who just plops your food and drinks down and doesn't engage with customers.i ordered a tri tip sandwich and my fiance ordered the calamari. we were able to sample the duck nuggets which were awesome! we will be coming back.

my family and i patronized this new business on a sunday and have virtually no complaints. &nbsp;our menu choices were grilled cheese with tomato soup, the pub burger, buffalo burger and salmon burger. &nbsp;everything was solid and we enjoyed every bite. &nbsp;while waiting for our food we took advantage of the nfl <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which means well drinks and selected beers are only $3. &nbsp;my vodka tonic was strong and not watered down. &nbsp;we also had no issues with service. &nbsp; please work on your website or upload your menu online somewhere so customers can get a better idea of what you have to offer ahead of time.
second time at the pub since it's been called the pub. &nbsp;first time i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was a bit disappointed. &nbsp;but today i came after a hike and it wasn't crowded. &nbsp;they were open easter sunday and my friend and i got seated right away! &nbsp;i love that they have $5 mimosa and $5 bloody mary's. &nbsp;had we gotten there before 1pm they have bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's also! &nbsp;it was already close to 1pm so i got the $5 bloody mary and was not disappointed. &nbsp;it was tasty! &nbsp;they also have breakfast on sunday's until 1pm and since it was only 12:53pm the waitress let me order from the breakfast menu. &nbsp;woot!! &nbsp;i had the banana pancakes. &nbsp;fresh banana's on top and in-between 2 slabs of pancakes were more bananas. &nbsp;smooshy ones but so delish. &nbsp;i love the side of pineapple on my dish as well.my friend had the pub style fish and chips and those were pretty tasty!the waitress mentioned that the last sunday of each month they have jazz music too! &nbsp;will definitely have to check that out and get there way before 1pm to take advantage of the bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's!parking is good; although i haven't been on a busy day but there is plenty of parking. &nbsp;conveniently located near the 71 freeway off pine ave.
welcome addition to the neighborhood!! &nbsp;the pub takes over after two other failed attempts to bring something fresh and inviting. &nbsp;foot print of the establishment remains the same, however, the decor is modern, hip and contemporary. &nbsp;ordered the pub burger with fried egg and bacon that packed a wallop! &nbsp;cooked perfectly at medium-rare, meat was juicy and bun was freshly baked. &nbsp;also ordered the baby back ribs which were flavorful and tender including the mac-cheese which has five different cheeses which was creamy and rich. good selection of draft beers and during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> there's a $2/discount on beers and $3 wines.our waitress tiffany was gracious, friendly and attentive. overall, i'm a big fan and will come back and invite others. hope the pub stands the test of time because the food is delicious and better than most and have to say the cookies were good!
very disappointed with food! started with chicken wings as an appetizer and they were 7.00 for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! we got 6 very small wings and they were over cooked and dry! the staff was nice and took them back but after that we decided we would eat somewhere else! it's sad that they have not learned from the other business's the have gone out of business there to have a better menu and food items that are tasty and not over priced! yes this place is over priced! &nbsp; this place probably won't be around for long unless they listen to their customers! this place could be happening &nbsp;if they would cater to the locals! myself and others that i have talked to won't go back either! :(
i kinda like this place, even if they go pretty heavy on the salt when it comes to food (especially the fries). all you need to do is ask for light salt and you're good. avocado hummus is interesting-- tastes like avocado but texture is like hummus. pretty good. duck fat popcorn .... mmmm. their buffalo burger is really good. it's got all the goodies: mushrooms, caramelized onions, arugula and gruyere. if you get it medium, it's very juicy. my boyfriend's pub burger was also really good and flavorful. both burgers were salty though. the tri-tip sandwich is alright since the meat is a bit dry and the bread too toasty-- i would stick to burgers. servers are nice and they have a late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starting at 11pm on the weekend till closing. the beer selection here is pretty awesome, not gonna lie-- it's a great deal too. honestly, it's more of a 3.5 star place for me but they have other good liquor specials and flights as well that i know i will definitely be back for!
love this place! the wait staff are so attentive and super nice and friendly, the food is excellent. the beer selection is pretty good with racer 5 and deschuttes black butte among others on tap during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. must try's: duck chorizo sliders, bacon wrapped hot dog on pretzel bun, pork belly appetizer, and their salads are all delicious. highly recommend this gem of a restaurant in chino hills!!
i wouldn't say it was a gastropub. the decor is more of a sports bar. the food menu sounds better than the food actually is. the food is ok but the drink selection was decent. i would recommend this more for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and a small bite if you're in the area. we had the calamari and it was pretty greasy, i told the waiter and he just &quot;ya it is but that's just how they do it&quot;. the pork belly bites were ok, but the aioli it came with was sweet. i don't mind sweet and savory, but this didn't work. we also had a trio of sliders, one of which was supposed to be &quot;duck chorizo&quot; but didn't taste much like duck. complimentary popcorn tossed in duck fat was ok. we had stone brew arrogant bastard on tap to drink.like i said, everything sounded amazing, unfortunately it didn't live up to it. other than the comment about the greasy calamari, i would say the service was good. our waiter was friendly, fast and would recommend things but i wouldn't care to come back any time soon :(
i brought my wife here to celebrate her birthday. &nbsp;since we had decided on &quot;dinner and a movie&quot; for her bday, we decided to share an appetizer and entree (cuz' we knew we were going to get some popcorn and soda at the movies).as soon as we were seated (and greeted) we received two glasses of water and a small bowl of popcorn drizzled with duck fat. &nbsp;i was surprised at how much duck fat tasted like real, salted butter. &nbsp;it was a nice change of pace from bread and butter, biscuits or chips and salsa being brought out prior to the meal. &nbsp;my only complaint would be that they drizzled a little too much duck fat on our popcorn, leaving an unappealing pool of grease which the pieces of popcorn at the bottom sat in.since we arrived during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, we took advantage of the $7.00 appetizer offering; we went with the fried pork belly bites served with and herb creme fraiche. the pork belly bites were very reminiscent of mexican carniceria (meat market) style chicharones (pork rinds). &nbsp;they are crispy and crunchy, salty and meaty, and are most definitely fried. &nbsp;i wasn't a fan of the seasoning on them (which i perceived as a heavy clove like flavor) but the herb creme fraiche (a mild, watery like sour cream) cut through it nicely.we ordered the buffalo burger which is billed as follows: all natural grass fed buffalo, portabello mushrooms, roasted red onions, gruyere cheese, wild arugula &amp; garlic aioli. &nbsp;since we split the burger, the burger was served, freshly cut in half, with each of us getting a generous side of fries on our plate (very nice touch). &nbsp;the burger was juicy and thick. &nbsp;the combination of toppings with the burger was tasty, as were the side of fries.when taking our orders, i asked the waitress to please bring out the beer i ordered with the burger. &nbsp;although a different waiter/server brought us our entrees, she was quick behind him with my beer. now that's great service. &nbsp;my wife only wanted water, but our waitress didn't neglect her because she did; her glass was always politely refilled. this is a nice, neat little gastropub in the chino area. &nbsp;it definitely has its locals, which tend to cozy up at the bar, but none of them seemed to be overly &quot;annoying&quot; in that &quot;hey, this is my bar, so i do what i want&quot; kind of way.overall, it was a great experience for a &quot;date night&quot; with the wife. next time we can find a night away from the children for one, i think we'll start it here again.
met up with bf and friends at this new joint for beer, food, and monday night football. &nbsp;it's kind of an unscale place (in a mediocre plaza); the kind of place where they serve chilled water from a corked glass bottle that is left on your table, served by the owner himself. &nbsp;then bam, you get the intriguing popcorn with duck fat to munch on while you peruse the menu. the waitress was helpful in making beer recommendations, and even offered generous samples comparable to blue moon, which they ran out of. &nbsp;interestingly enough, they had angry orchard (my fav apple flavored beer at the moment).the bf and i split the bison burger and fries. &nbsp;the burger was juicy and delicious, fries were crispy, and pickle was surprisingly spicy! while the food was delicious, had to knock down a star because the waitress just kinda disappeared after getting our food. &nbsp;after our meal, our empty plates stayed on the table up until the time we paid the bill, which was about an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> after finishing our meals.i wouldn't mind coming back to this place and trying out other food, but it is definitely not cheap. &nbsp;maybe <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, next time....

<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> oysters yummmmmmm
they treat <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> guests like shit. if you're ordering food off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu but not having &quot;dinner,&quot; you're only allowed to sit at the bar. there were tons of open tables, but we were supposed to stand around and wait for a seat at the bar, which was full. oftentimes, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> bleeds into dinner, and i will end up spending the bucks. if you're not going to seat me when you have so many open tables, i'm not going to stick around. why even bother having a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if you're only going to be nice to people paying non-<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices?
it would get 5 stars but they ran out of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> oysters 1 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> in! short wait for seating at the bar.
great brunch spot. everything i've tried has been excellent. went here for a late dinner and was hooked up by the staff...great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals too!
this review is for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. that being said, i am not one to be sold on presentation alone. if the food looks great on the plate, that's nice and everything, but i'm more concerned with the taste and price. i thought barbix was expensive for what it was. they don't have a very good selection of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu items (although the glass of moscato i ordered was probably the most delicious moscato i've ever had). the food is prepared to look super upscale and trendy, which is exciting when it first comes out, but once you start eating, it's not at all impressive. we ordered a few things off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu (which only applies if you sit at the bar), and ended up quickly paying and going somewhere else. why the quality of a restaurant's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is so important is because it allows me to try their food without paying $30 for an entree. if i like the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food, i will come back (hopefully with a date, a girl can dream) and spend money for a full dinner. i honestly was not impressed with barbix at all. some place so cute should have better service and tastier food. and the people raving about their deviled eggs have clearly never been to a southern bbq! who puts a sardine on a deviled egg?? who?!
came here a couple mondays ago for $1 oysters and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.between my friend and i we ate 24 fanny bay, 6 beausoleil and 6 eld inlet oysters. our favorite ones were of course fanny bay oysters from vancouver. they are creamy and full of juice! although <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> suppose to run all night, but the night we were there. the $1 oysters special ran out an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> after it started. making it ultra special for us to be able to gobble down 3 dozens oysters and drank 805 in to a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> monday night. we also tried the delicious bone marrow and crispy fries. all that was amazing... and i wouldn't mind going back again to try their other delicious <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials.
i went here on a weeknight for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i loved it. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great--glasses of wine are anywhere from $4-$6! i went with a large group and the staff was super accommodating, letting us sit outside and still order <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the outside area is super cute and great on a summer night. we ordered a variety of dishes, including: burrata, brussels sprouts, saffron arancini, a charcuterie plate, and 2 cheese plates. everything tasted delicious, especially the crispy brussels sprouts and burrata. definitely try this place if you are in the area--great drink deals for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the food isn't cheap but it's very good. to save some money, i recommend street parking instead of valet.
came here for monday night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was very pleasantly surprised. the place is warm and inviting, dark wood inside, and a nice patio with fire space heaters. we were greeted by the host as soon as we came up to the door, and seated at the bar when we told them we were there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. he let us know we had 15 minutes left to order and the bar tender was super attentive and patient, letting us sample 2-3 wines before we finally made up our minds. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great, with 1/2 off glasses of a wide array of wines. another nice surprise was that monday was 1$ oyster night. &nbsp;this was just an added bonus. i have to say, they weren't the best oysters i've had during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ---- they were a little beaten up due to poor shucking and there was less brine/liquor than i would've liked in the shells, but combined with the rest of the experience...still a solid 4 stars. &nbsp;this place is already on my list of brunch places to try and i can't wait to come back!
if you're going to cancel <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for valentine's day, let people know on your website.
we went there at about 9pm. food was great, we had 4 things and 2 beers. when the check came was shocked to see a 90.00 bill. may i &nbsp;suggest going during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!?? ambiance was great!
chill little spot, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices at the bar until 7:30. had a decent glass of red there last night, didn't eat anything. very homey. i'd definitely go back and try the brunch.
love it! went for $1 oysters mondays with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> wine and we got our money's worth! love how you can get three kinds of oysters my favorite ones are the inlet ones from washington cuz they are super sweet! had the bone marrow, calamari, and roasted brussel sprouts and all were excellent. you only get the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at the bar so luckily we got there right at 6pm when they started and got valet since the parking is super small. it's pricy here over all but it's worth it if you wanna splurge on other food like i did!
we came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> one evening and had a great time. the bar is really cool and intimate. the food is kinda whatever but that's fine. they have some really great wines by the glass and they are all half off during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the burger is discounted to $12 for hh and is just aight. deviled eggs are a bit strange and i don't recommend them. chill spot to enjoy a glass of wine though.
pretty decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> wine pricing at 50% off menu price, because i definitely wouldn't pay full price for those wines. but having to come here only at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for that pricing makes it very inconvenient for me, so i won't be coming here again. i'm glad to see it gets good reviews but for me, this place is fair. the burger was fair. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger price of $6 was a ripoff because it was tiny and should have been a slider in a set of 3. my friend had fish that was bland, greazy and smothered in mayo.
great place for drinks .. fun bar and friendly stuff knows a lot about they wine.. and will remember what do you like. <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> oysters monday $1 can not beat. tapas on the menus , the food is always great. i like to have this place in walking distance.
all you need to know is <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - 50% off all beer and wine by the glass. (monday-wednesday &nbsp;6-7pm - at the bar only) during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, you also get duck fat popped popcorn for $1, but i didn't think it was anything special. weird aftertaste...deviled eggs with marinated boquerones (anchovies) - $5  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delicious!!! the anchovies add a perfect hint of saltiness to the eggs.burrata with prosciutto, arugula &amp; block olive tapenade - $10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nice and creamy. perfect with any wine.garlic fried sweetbreads - $6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; little balls of heaven!!you can also get cheese with your wine: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;one cheese $5, three cheese $15try their chianti, dalla pancia ($9/glass)!!! :d
i had their burger there the other day and it was awesome. &nbsp;the owner came out or manager to talk. &nbsp;he was really cool and i appreciate good customer service. &nbsp;the bar was clean, the place has parking, the good was very tasty and fast. i wish i drank, but i don't they have a bunch of wines. &nbsp;they have great small plates and their burger for $12 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i will be back to try more things on their menu.
was looking for a spot for a late dinner and this was one of the few spots open after 10pm. it had a lovely patio, but chose to sit at the bar, where they offered a tuesday special of 1/2 lb of shrimp in the shell for $10 and a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> of 1/2 off wine. it was delicious, as well as the brussel sprouts, too. overall, a great experience and will be back!
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on monday with 1$ oysters at the bar (only) is so enchanting. great wine, great oysters and it's beautiful that you see a bar circle filled with people who are there for the same reason. i tried the chicken liver mousse and have to say it missed the special touch - the sherry and sea salt.. or maybe rather cognac. totally a place to have a date with oysters though. :) i will return.
the combination of solid innovative well priced food, great wine list, great staff and very personable friendly owners, barbrix is one of my favorite places to go in la. there <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is small but fun, and i have yet to try one of chef dons cooking classes but they look awesome.thankyou barbrix for being there.

breakfast here was okay, but the food at dinner was really good- balanced cheese plates with great variety, lots of tried and true appetizers with their own little twist on them; and the atmosphere is nice- dim candle lighting and no pretentious vibes. even though they are a wine bar, there are plenty of other interesting drinks to try.service felt off both times i visited barbrix. at dinner the wait staff started off overly attentive then disappeared for longer periods of time, forgetting to bring us items we asked for, like water. i thought this was likely because of they get busy during their monday oyster bar <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but when i visited again for breakfast and we arrived about 5 minutes earlier than their opening time, the hostess was clearly annoyed that we were there early.i really wanted to like this place, but it's just okay. overall it isn't absolutely terrible, but there are plenty of other similar options in la with better service.
great spot. &nbsp;came in for sunday brunch. &nbsp;definitely make a reservation otherwise your seated at the bar. &nbsp;we really wanted to sit at the patio but no luck. &nbsp;once seatedat the bar and had our mimosas which is $5 bottomless with an entree order, not bad for mimosa fans. the food was delicious. &nbsp;loved my french toast with berry compote, ordered the crab hash with poached eggs and that was reeeaaaallllly yummy. &nbsp;the bacon and eggs comes as a side order a la carte which got pricier. &nbsp;since this area is difficult with parking i suggest to have it valet. &nbsp;worth it than haggling looking for a spot. &nbsp;noticed they have late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials between 10-11pm. &nbsp;i'll have to give it a try.
some of us shared wonderful small plates while one of us felt he had to have his own food (no names mentioned ;-). the small plates included dates, meatballs, brussels sprouts to die for, frisee salad, mussels, and lamb chops. the meal that was scarfed down by one person was a burger with cheese.if you are confused about what you would like to eat, check with your server. our was able to tell us if they were good to be shared by 4 people along with a candid evaluation of the dishes.try coming during the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (6:00-7:30) at the bar. they serve wine and 1/2 price by the glass and a burger for $8 sunday-thursday evening. &nbsp;valet parking
the food was good but the portions were ridiculously small for the price - $15 for a small bowl of pasta, $6 &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price&quot; for one slider, $4 for a warm coke. who do these people think they are - the four seasons? this is silver lake not beverly hills. &nbsp;we were really looking forward to a good meal and ended up feeling ripped-off.very disappointing...
3.5 stars rounding up.i had dinner here with 3 girl friends last night. found meter parking closeby on the street and only had to pay $1.50 (it's free after 8pm) which is better than the $6 valet parking!we had reservations so we got seated right away but there were still a good amount of tables available. we thought we were going to order drinks from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu but it turns out <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is only if you sit at the bar! bumble-bummers. but i ordered a glass of prosecco anyway. mmm gotta love the bubbly!their menu has a bunch of small plates so we got a bunch to share.crostini misti - 3 crunchy little bread pieces with different toppings on each. they were okay for the most part. wouldn't order it again.hamachi crudo- it was a little too fishy for our taste. but the avocado was a nice touch!shrimp &amp; chickpea flour tortillas w/ cilantro tzatziki - the tzatziki sauce was delicious and essential to the dish! i think it would have been kinda plain without it. if you're korean, this dish looks and tastes a lot like bu-chin-gae!sweet potato and rapini hash - rapini is like little broccoli. this was like a little side dish of mostly cubes of sweet potato. this was a-okayyy.grilled broccolini w/ chili, garlic, lemon aioli. this one was my fave of the night! and everyone else loved it too! who would have thought broccolini would be so good? but it was because of the aioli! sooo good! i think i could dip anything in that sauce and it'd be deeeelicious!pappardelle pasta w/ dungeness crab w/ artichoke hearts &amp; fresno chilis and mint. this was the most filling dish of the night (and the most expensive). the pasta is a little on the plainer side but it tasted pretty good. i think overall, the restaurant is best for an intimate date. ambience is dimlit and romantic, kind of on the plainer wooden side but it's still nice and cozy. service was extremely quick and also very friendly and pleasant. all the food came out super fast and we never had to wait around for anything which was nice. we were done in less than an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>! overall, i'd give this place a try again - maybe next time i'll sit at the bar for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and try more from their wine selection. :)
i've heard great things about this place and was looking forward to trying it! &nbsp;it's tucked away location in silver lake is welcoming and quaint and my friends and i enjoyed wine and tapas on the nicely lit patio. &nbsp;barbrix is open late so i'd be curious to how it is after dinner..and also curious about their sunday bottomless brunch, but we were very satisfied with our experience. &nbsp;prices not so bad either. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and non <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.we tried:deviled eggs (skip this..also, know that it has anchovies!)spanish olives (good to snack on while you're waiting for friends)pork and ricotta meatballs (delicious!!)fusili ragu (looks like your traditional pasta, but wow was it tasty)burrata and tomato salad w pan con tomate (very good)roasted brussels sprouts with ricotta salata (delicious! definitely would get this again)i have no complaints about the place..well perhaps that it doesn't have a full bar, but that's ok. &nbsp;it was truly a neighborhood gem and i look forward to going back again.
this place is more awesome after 10pm (late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>), and at the bar.we went in and had wine and cheese, back in the table area. it was pretty overpriced for the amount of bread and cheese that you got, but it tasted good. but they kept clearing our table like, every three seconds, and i got the feeling they wanted us out of there. it was kind of unnerving. so after we paid our bill there, we went to the bar up front, which was much more chill. this place is great for a date but save your $ on food elsewhere!
barbix is hands down my favorite wine bar in la! the wine is tasty and food is great (though a bit pricey). the staff is friendly and bartenders brion &amp; janine are always spot on with their wine recommendations. oh, it's conveniently located across the street from my office too... perfect for post-work <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (half-price wine from 6-7:30? yes, please)!!
i've been here a few times for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and dinner. &nbsp;i truly wanted to like it more than i actually do. &nbsp;the wine selection is fine, but the bartenders could be more attentive. &nbsp;the small plates are...very small and pricey. &nbsp;nothing really stands out except the pork belly (but then again, i'm a sucker for most pork belly). &nbsp;the food isn't quite remarkable enough to make it a regular dinner destination. &nbsp;i guess there are just other places where i can grab a nice glass of wine with small bites at a better price. &nbsp;cute place for drinks or a date if you're in the area.oh, desserts are good...the apple crumble thing was yummy.
ive now been here twice, and the only reason why i've been here a second time is because i forgot that barbrix was that one place i had gone that one time that was &quot;meh&quot;... woops. i sent my friends to meet me there on a friday evening with the assurance that there would be a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> happening for drinks and appetizers according to a local <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> website. upon meeting my friends they informed me that the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was not happening on fridays which was quite disappointing. i am very aware that that is not barbrix's fault considering this was misinformation on a 3rd party website, but considering the prices the practice, i think they should look into <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a friday at 630pm. anywhoo, we order a bottle of red that we all share along with some appetizers, one person at our table order a full on meal and beer. the plate known as &quot;hams of the world&quot;, great name by the way, was alright, but not mind blowing. i have hard far better hams and farrrrr better prosciuttos, though the quantity was adequate the quality did not reflect the price. the red wine was alright but i definitely felt like the waitress had a personal vendetta against humanity, as she a) never smiled b) need to be more presentable (i know we are in silver lake and looking like a hippie is okay on the street but not as a waitress at a $15+ a plate restaurant) c) served me far less wine than the others at the table e) snatched the glasses when we were barely even done with the wine left in the cup f) slammed the check on the table when we had not even asked for it, the place was empty (so its not like they were looking to make room) and we had not been there that long. though the atmosphere is nice, barbrix you need to get your sh*t together. get better wait staff and better charcuterie. lame. thank god for the good company of your friends. boo
the ambience is nice and service is great. love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too but food wasn't so great. the side dishes and appetizers were ok but their main dishes were all a fail for us. specially my order. i got vongole and was extremely salty as if they poured the whole dish amount of salt on one side and forget to stir it and i bit into it. except is was the whole dish. i had to make a comment about it to our waitress. she handled this very nicely. took the dish away and came back saying that they tried it inside and it was salty for them as well and swapped it out with a new one. over all, i would go back for <span class="highlighted">happy</span> hr and small bites but not to dine here.
ok, so i kind of had the same experience as another reviewer in which the food and drinks were quite delightful, but the service most definitely was not. i was there on a saturday night with a large group of friends celebrating a birthday. wads of money were about to be handed over, yet the wait staff were lukewarm and elusive to say the least. gonna try again tonight for the early <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
one bad apple. &nbsp;brian s. definitely spoiled the bunch. &nbsp;barbrix is a little neighborhood gem. &nbsp;but sadly, i doubt i'll ever return. &nbsp;i live a few houses away. &nbsp;a dear friend from high school was in town overnight and i said 'let's walk over to barbrix. &nbsp;you'll love it.&quot; &nbsp;the lovely hostess helped us find a great little corner of the bar. &nbsp;brian s., the bartender, immediately greeted us and helped us get settled. &nbsp;then he brought over some menus and mumbled something really fast under his breath. &nbsp;i only caught the word &quot;wine&quot; and i thought i caught the words &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.&quot; &nbsp; he was talking a bit fast and low. &nbsp;so i re-reasked to clarify which wines were on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.brian s. looked me square in the eye. &nbsp;put his hands on the bar in front of me. &nbsp;and shot out &quot;i just told you.&quot; &nbsp;silence. &nbsp;boom. &nbsp;no smile. &nbsp;no clarification.i laughed uncomfortably. &nbsp;my friend stared in silence. &nbsp;brian kept his stance and glare. &nbsp;clearly, he wasn't joking.so i chose to apologize. &nbsp;i'm not sure for what. &nbsp;but i said &quot;i'm so sorry, i guess i didn't really hear that part.&quot; &nbsp;brian said, &quot;yah, i just told you these wines are on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; and half-pointed again to wine list that was covered by the food menu. &nbsp;i felt shamed and embarrassed in front of my friend. &nbsp;i just quickly ordered something i already knew on the menu to try to move past the moment. &nbsp;i couldn't enjoy the food or the wine. &nbsp;i just wanted to have our drink and move on.one bad apple. &nbsp;a forever rotten branch on an otherwise pretty tree.
great ambiance. loved it as soon as i walked in. friendly wait staff (even after accidentally setting my menu on fire, lol!!)the food was pretty good. for the price though i wasn't falling out of my seat. me and a girlfriend ordered the shrimp and chickpea flour tortillas, arugula salad, brussel sprout and cauliflower hash, trout, scallops, and ginger shortcake. the fish dishes are pricey at $16 a pop and very very small portions, but they were probably the most delicious. the arugula salad as well. brussel sprout dish tasted a bit overcooked - almost burt. eek. fun dinner, great ambiance, ok food, nice staff, nice selection of wines, definitely a bit pricey. definitely want to come back to give the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> a try.
this review is only for the service since we left before ordering. barbrix has a parking lot in front, but they charge for &quot;valet&quot; service, which really just means you're paying 6 bucks to park your own car.upon seating, we asked about the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> clearly advertised on their website as monday - wednesday from 6-7pm. apparently they were not honoring this promotion, but rather than apologize for the error the waitress insisted, nearly accusingly, that we must have read it wrong. i found her attitude extremely rude and i will not be returning.

i came here to do tapas and was underwhelmed by their offering for the price. a glass of wine averages $13....so unless you're a big, big fan of wine, i'd skip this place (i like wine, but i don't know enough about it to really appreciate a $15 glass of wiine). nonetheless, a friend and i were looking forward to some awesome tapas because the reviews seemed decent. i think my favorite things here were the brussel sprouts and the bacon wrapped dates. we also got the cheese plate...but this is only fun to get if you get wine. and the cheese plate is pricey too.i'd still come here again because it's really, really cute and their entrees on the menu looked delicious (and perhaps even worth the price). but...i don't think i'd consider this a great tapas place. brunch and dinner seem the most ideal for this place. i'll maybe even stop by for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> since it runs sunday-thursday and isn't too far from me.one more con: service. my friend and i walked in without a reservation and the hostess seemed annoyed that we wanted to sit outside when the place wasn't even packed. also, the waitress took a really long time to take our order. we actually had to flag her down to even order. and then our table sucked because it was all wobbly. thankfully someone took care of it right away, so they earn some stars for that.
so...i keep coming back here - first time to review.i have been a few times and each time i find a wonderful experience!i have been twice before last night - once i sat at the bar for apps and a glass of wine after work and once i took my visiting family (from michigan) here. both times were superb. last night i stopped after work...it is right on my way home! how convenient.i sat at the bar. i drank a half-priced glass of wine (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>) that was a very good italian red, similar to chianti (can't think of the grape right now). i also ordered two small plates to enjoy...1. meatballs in a lemongrass juice - very tender, full of flavor and enjoyable. perfect portion size.2. crostini - 3 separate crostinis...a) gorgonzola, roasted pear, and pomegranate seeds!! b) green olive tapenade with goat cheese c) chicken liver mouse and pickled red onion -- these were delicious.i love this place and will continue to visit. nice, small, quiet, and cozy setting!!thumbs way up!
if you do go to barbrix, go during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;selected beers and the wine is half off which is a steal. &nbsp;the service was very attentive and the place itself is nice. &nbsp;a great place to hang and catch up with friends or go out on a date. &nbsp;the food was good. &nbsp;not bad, but not great. &nbsp;the plates are a little expensive but that's what you expect when you go to a tapas place. &nbsp;the portions are small so you have to order a few plates to fill yourself up.what we ordered:1) deviled eggs- &nbsp;has boquerones (white anchovies) which added a nice taste.2) porcini mushroom arancini- delicious. &nbsp;fontina stuffed mushrooms packed with rice, breaded in crumbs and later, fried. &nbsp;crispy delight! 3) lamp chops- good. &nbsp;we had them medium rare. &nbsp;the portions were small for the 17 dollar price.4) spanish sausage- really good. &nbsp;served with pickled red cabbage and their sweet onion mustard. &nbsp;overall, good food and a good place to hang out. &nbsp;however, we were still hungry after so when we left, we went across the street to tomato pie to get a slice of pizza to fill us up.
first things first: the music blaring here is way too loud! it seems more appropriate at a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> type place like barbarella, but people are trying to have conversations here.the food? very good. the burrata was the winner of the night. creamy and rich, floating on your fork like a puffy cloud. the blistered shisito peppers were blackened until tender, to the point where even the stem was edible, with the salt grains adding a definitive crunch. the crispy grilled polenta and duck leg confit were both rich and nicely textured. only loser of the night was the rosemary ham, which tasted not much different than what you can get in the deli aisle at trader joe's. this was surprising given how well prepared everything else was.the wine menu is not bad, but i think they can afford to be a little more adventurous with the selection and provide bigger pours if they're going to be called a wine bar.all in all i'd give it a solid recommendation and i will be back. the list of good restaurants in this area just keeps growing!
omg, the polenta/mushroom dish was the best thing i ate during my time in la. it was small and simple - basically a disc of polenta sitting in a creamy mushroom sauce - but i could have eaten four of those things if i didn't have so much else to try. at the time i called it &quot;the most subtle use of gorgonzola i've ever experienced.&quot; awesome.a lot of the other things we tried shined as well. the charcuterie board was a steal - $17 for a giant plate of 5 delicious meats. definitely try the prosciutto! we also had a very good beet salad and a veal bratwurst that was tasty but quite didn't stand up to my wisconsin-infused standards for spicy brat-y goodness despite the tasty pesto it was sitting on.service was very attentive - plates were cleared quickly, and our server was helpful in picking our dishes. it also looks like it'd be a great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - there's a big, square bar, the atmosphere is 'chic homey,' and the wine selection is excellent.
why write a positive review, when they have so many? &nbsp;because we've been going since opening week, and still absolutely love this place! &nbsp;we try and hit many of the hot new places, but we're happiest when we come back to barbrix. the atmosphere is wonderful, especially the seating at the bar - open and perfect for sharing specialty cheese/charcuterie/small-plates/wine with good friends or for date night. &nbsp;the entire wait staff is considerate and professional. &nbsp;co-owner claudio is always gracious and accommodating. &nbsp;the bartender brian is awesome. &nbsp;he's very helpful suggesting a great wine or new dish. &nbsp;favorites: deviled eggs - boquerones (marinated anchovies) makes this flavor/texturecharred octopus salad - so good! if you are at all curious, try itpork belly - delicious sweet/savory korean bbq on mini lettuce bedcrispy brussels sprouts - and the roasted cauliflower made me love vegetablesscallops - perfectly seared, flavorfulhanger steak - killer mustard/peppercorn sauce. the boyfriend loves this onetips: if you don't like a place that's a little loud, go on a quieter night or time. &nbsp;the seating atmospheres vary, so find an area that suits you. &nbsp;don't miss the open bottle wines on the chalkboard, <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, and st. peter's ale! the quality &amp; care at barbrix makes me proud of this local la spot.
it was someone's birthday recently. my friend and i were scrambling to find a decent restaurant that can accommodate about 15pax without having to resort to reserving shakeys, bucca di bepo, fridays or houston's. not that there is something wrong with that. yes, really.we finally decided to call barbrix because we were running out of options and the big night was just a week away.for one, it's conveniently close. i mean, &nbsp;i can throw a stone and probably break the glass door. well, maybe i'm exaggerating but it's just down the hill from the house. and if we ended up getting terribly sloshed -which we intend to do that night - we can easily walk back to my place although i'm not really looking forward to that especially we might run into some skunks and the occasional coyote.we got there and the maitre'd already knew who we are without having to tell him the name on the reservation. &nbsp;the place was packed, busy, and buzzing - figuratively and literally; tt was only a matter of time that we too were going to be.with bottles of red wine on the table and food served, we were set for the night &nbsp;that lasted until about 11pm.basically, food is good. i'm won't rave about it. i won't complain about it. &nbsp;it was more the people in the group and the amount of wine being imbided that made our visit here pleasantly surprising. a couple standouts were the pork belly and, yes, the cocktail weiners, err, i mean, the camtimpalitos. total damage for the night? $50! a deal. and no, it wasn't <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.however, for a place that has a long list of small plates, they could have easily come up with a few creative desserts. what's good about sex if i'm not going to have an orgasm? right?a brownie?! come on...and one last thing. i totally hate a restaurant that frames any press &nbsp;clippings. it's like a living room filled with framed college diplomas. it's just tacky. 3.5 stars. and that's generous.
wow, i wasn't expecting to be as blown aways as i was by this restaurant. &nbsp;i think part of the reason is because under categories on the yelp page, it's listed as tapas/small plates. &nbsp;when i think tapas, i think olives, manchego cheese, iberico ham,etc (spanish fare). &nbsp;my particular palate doesn't rejoice at those words. &nbsp;and i've had exceptional quality ham (can't remember if it was iberico) sliced from a certain hotel in beverly hills. it's like selling excellent filet mignon....to well, someone who doesn't like filet mignon. &nbsp;as per a friend's suggestion, i decided to try this place anyway &amp; i'm glad i did! i also delightfully discovered that it wasn't exactly spanish as it was a fusion of mediterranean influences that were served on small plates of deliciousness. &nbsp;we had reservations made days before we went that were changed to a little later (hey life is hectic sometimes)...and then the day of, we both realized that due to the unpredictability of traffic, we were there early! the hostess/wife and owner were still accomodating which was much appreciated because we've all been to certain restaurants that are not (those restaurants shall be nameless because i don't like to bring forth bad karma, as evidenced by my reviews)we declined to have wine w/ our meal because we had a show (which had 2 drink minimum per person) to get to but i'm sure the wine would have taken the great food to another level. i've noticed that they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and cooking classes both of which i plan on returning to try. &nbsp;for a more in depth experience &amp; picture: <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2frenaissancediana.typepad.com%2f&amp;s=1e314b610067fafd407f309a897d4dfdb4a14d516b0df17ccfb0477f0fa473bd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">renaissancediana.typepad…</a>
cannot beat $5 mimosas for brunch. came here with two girlfriends for some lovely brunch and mimosas. i made reservations the night before for 11am and didn't seem like i had to make reservations. however, 30 minutes later, it was pretty packed. everyone was taking advantage of the $5 mimosas and having a great time. the people are all so very nice and welcoming.restaurant is clean. my friends and i all got the fried chicken sandwich with the pretzel bun. it was pretty good! as you know, we also got the $5 bottomless mimosas. the only catch is that each person must order an entree over $12 to get the $5 bottomless.parking is not too bad here on a saturday morning. you can either valet park for $6 or street park. it is $1 per <span class="highlighted">hour</span> on the meters with a 2 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> max. we left here full and <span class="highlighted">happy</span>.
love this new place. great staff, menu and vibe. i'd eat outside next time because it got too stuffy, and loud, after just an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>...though the bar in back could be a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> option, too. a lovely sculpted plate of burrata with artichoke, red peppers and black olive was divine, however the halibut was disappointing: too salty and overcooked. yet what a great reminder that i would enjoy cooking more with sunchokes and chard. <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to go back and continue sampling their sweetly edited offerings.
done.barbrix has lost my loyalty. i applaud that you've become the it brunch place in the los feliz/silverlake/atwater area. i wish nothing but success for any restaurant. but the longevity lies in the way you treat your guests. and the service today was horrendous. we were a party of three without a reservation. we waited for our table with our friend because we talked so highly of barbrix. we were sat at 12:24. i looked because we were quoted an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> wait and was surprised that is was quicker. we weren't greeted by our server until a good five minutes after we had sat. that's fine, you're busy. we knew what we wanted. i made a joke about the raise in prices for bottomless mimosas: barbrix went from an insanely low $5 to $8 this weekend. i honestly never understood how they made money with $5 unlimited and thought it smart to finally raise it. $8 is still a steal. our server responded with &quot;i just work here.&quot; okay, fine. servers hear stupid jokes all day, i'm sure. we ordered two appetizers, three entrees, and bottomless for all. we started with their &quot;prosecco cocktail&quot; which the server originally said was earl grey but ended up being spicy mimosa. no big deal. i specifically told her we do not care if we are refilled with mimosas. we will gladly switch. we just wanted to try the &quot;cocktail of the week.&quot; well, we may as well ordered the &quot;drink slowly because nobody will ever come to refill it&quot; cocktail, because that's what happened. we watched as other servers carried pitchers of glorious mimosas around to their tables and joked and laughed and danced (okay, maybe not danced) with the tables around us. the table directly behind us had sung <span class="highlighted">happy</span> birthday, and had two refills of mimosas from their server as our glasses sat barren. finally, our server comes back and says &quot;oh, looks like you need more mimosas!&quot; leaves and comes back with our first refill. so now we're on our second mimosa and we've basically finished eating. we drink and chat. she comes back and clears our plates. glasses are more than half empty (a metaphor for this brunch). server returns, check in hand. &quot;do you want dessert?&quot; we say &quot;no, thanks.&quot; she drops the check. no, &quot;one more round before you go?&quot; no, &quot;anything else?&quot; just a check drop. ooooookkkkkkkk then. so we sit and chat, just hoping somebody will offer. just a basic customer service thing. &quot;hey, more mimosas from this pitcher i'm carrying!?&quot; nope. so as server of the year finally walks by i have to do the &quot;excuse me!&quot; and get her attention. i hate that. i only use it when it's an emergency. she comes over. &quot;may we have another refill please?&quot; and judging by her face, that translated into &quot;your mother hates you.&quot; because she was upset. like literally upset. as if we had been inundated with mimosas for the 40 minutes we had taken up her table (i know they're busy. we weren't there long at all). we had had two each. two. sorry, but if i'm going to a bottomless brunch, two is not cutting it. she poured that refill and you could tell on her face she was thinking &quot;choke on the pulp, bitches.&quot; so we got our third refill and finally stick cash in the bill. seriously, the second we stuck that money in the check the hostess swooped in like it was her ticket out of there. ok thanks hostess with the <span class="highlighted">happy</span> face...nah, i won't go there. server comes back with change and all the sudden she's so chipper! sorry, girl. i won't be made to feel like shit because i ask for a 3rd mimosa during unlimited mimosas brunch when we hadn't even been there an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>, not only ordered entrees but apps as well (i'm guessing most people don't order apps at brunch), and you treat us like we're a bother. we left 10%. sorry. but that's what attitude gets you. and we won't be back. ever. hyperion public and barbarella both treat you so much better for the price.
this review is not of the &quot;soapbox&quot; genre, but there were a few things about my trip to this place last night that *really* bugged me. before my friends and i left, i solemnly (read: drunkenly) vowed to the group that i would write a yelp review of barbrix. well, it's tomorrow now, and i'm not drunk anymore. so, without further ado...i met a group of people at barbrix last night to celebrate the birthday of a good friend. the service started out fine - the restaurant wasn't too busy, and we ordered a couple of bottles of wine and a number of plates. no thang. the waitress seemed to be on top of things. (attention: perception is not always reflective of reality. more on that later.)the meal was going off without a hitch, but i started to get annoyed when the bus boy (er, man) kept trying to clear plates that clearly still had food on them. bitch, when i pay good money for a burrata &quot;salad&quot; (read: small blob of cheese atop some kind of sundried tomato-tasting compote and, like, one slice of eggplant - for the record, it tasted great, no hate there), i want to finish that shit. in fact, it wouldn't matter if it was an $8 burrata cheese blob or a fucking paper container full of liquefied nacho cheese - bottom line, i'm a patron of your business, and i'll let you know when i'm finished with my plate, thanks. i don't like being hustled out of any restaurant, but it's especially inappropriate during normal business <span class="highlighted">hours</span> (the sun had yet to set), when there are (literally) 10 other people in the building, and where you're paying $16 for three veal meatballs. i finally had to say to him, &quot;if there is still food on the plates, don't take them. thanks.&quot; guh.we nosh on - the wine is flowing, the food tastes great. as the night draws to a close, we ask for the check, blah blah blah. so the waitress brings it out. the check clearly stated that the total was $320 and change. total. including tax. we gave her $80 cash and asked her to split the rest on four different cards (yes, i used to wait tables, and no, it is not hard to split credit cards, even if there are 10 of them, i promise). note that everyone in our party - all of us having worked service jobs at some point or another in our respective lifetimes - is in the habit of tipping at least 20%, and we are always <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to pay an included gratuity when it is included, but there was, for the record, no gratuity listed on the check. nada. zilch. zeroski.old girl brings the cards back with the receipts for us each to sign. i immediately notice that the totals are inflated (read: wrong) - she charged us each $67 and change, when the total for each of us should have been $60 and change. so there i go, mathy mcanal, fingers furiously tapping the numbers on my phone calculator to figure out precisely where her calculations had gone wrong and from whence she might have pulled this magical new number. all i'm going to say about that is that i still don't know what she did or what calculator she was using. (the calculator that overcharges people, apparently.)[insert semi-drunken &quot;i'm going to write them up on yelp tomorrow!&quot; comment here.] at this point, i was through dealing with the waitress. i didn't even call her over - not that she was anywhere to be seen, of course, a problem that had become increasingly bothersome as the night drew on, but i digress. i told my friends what to tip (much less than we had originally intended to, as she was clearly going to make some money off of what she had already erroneously charged to our cards) and left. it's the silver lake paradox - &quot;foodie&quot; food served with american apparel 'tude. seriously, i get better service at my local donut shop, where my average (okay, twice-yearly) purchase is less than $2.whatevs. i'm sure i'll be back, because when in silver lake, do as the silver lakeians do, but day-um, do i hate paying good (read: any) money for shitty service. unexcusable, unacceptable, unconscionable.i'd like to conclude my review by noting that we still tipped sneaky mcbitchlerson 18%. how's that for taking the high road?
chaparral-300-chino-hills
we really like this bowling alley. &nbsp;very clean. wednesday $1 bowling is a steal. &nbsp;the bar area is huge. lots of good beers on tab. good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals. very good selection of food as well. we took some bowling lessons from the pro shop and it was very helpful.
i love bringing my kids here to bowl.. we always have a great time. cosmic bowling is pretty fun too.. have to remember to come during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. can get pretty pricey if you have more than 3..
i came here for a company event, which included reserved lanes and food. the place itself is an average size for a bowling alley. additionally, there is a sports bar offering reasonable <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. the cocktail drinks were not looking impressive, so i stuck with draft beer. plenty of parking, bowling balls, and no malfunctioning equipment. i would come here again.
been here plenty of times with friends to watch games and to bowl. mostly to chill at the bar and have some brews. they have a good selection of beers on tap which is great. and the bartenders are always nice and helpful. they also have a bunch of tv's all over the place. great for sporting events. pool tables, shuffle board, and darts too. they also have a decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for food. place is pretty large so plenty of room for everyone. if you're in the area i would totally suggest going here with friends to bowl or just hang out at the bar. this is my new favorite spot in town.
to me, this is not the average bowling alley. compared to brunswick, this place is pretty awesome! the bar area is huge. they have pool tables, darts, and the shuffle board!! they have really good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too during the week days ($3 for well drinks!!). on saturday nights, unlimited bowling for $15 starts after 10pm until closing time. cosmic bowling is the usual. lights go out and music comes on. the lights can get pretty annoying. they kept shining in my eyes as i was bowling! i do, however, wished they had music videos playing!! it's always fun to watch those. other than that, i do enjoy bowling here! it's much more fun than brunswick.
came for a friend's birthday and there was a lot of activities that we all participated in! there was of course, bowling in arcade in the main room. in the bar area, you could play large jenga, one foosball table, 8-ish tables for pool ($1 per game, quarters - leave credit card for cue ball), one nintendo 64 console (free), and 5-ish dart boards (free by leaving id at bar). we came around 5-6pm on friday and there was not a lot of people in the bar area. by 7:30-8pm, all the pool tables were taken.decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals: m-f 3-7pm // $1 hot dog / $3 wells (vodka, gin, rum, tequila) / $5 long islands / $7 small 1-topping pizza / $7.75 for a pound of wings (approx 12 wings) / $12 domestic pitchers / $3 select pintswe ordered fries ($4 for the large) and the wings ($7.75) for 12 wings. you can choose from a variety of flavors for the wings. i tried the general tso and the bbq. the wings and fries were okay. standard bowling food. summary: fun place if you're looking for lots of different things to do. cheap pool. i would come back.
even though we have never been here on a busy night, we still enjoy coming here for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and a few games of bowling. the bar area is huge and there is plenty seating and they offer karaoke and live bands. the beer selection is wide and the bartenders are friendly and willing to help. i have personally never experienced anything bad at this place so if you enjoy bowling and getting a few beers and watching some games than i would suggest this place.
this bowling alley is a hybrid of a typical old-school bowling house &amp; a more state-of-the-art round 1 entertainment establishment. it's like an old-school bowling alley because of the house equipment(balls, shoes) which is old and grimy like other bowling alleys. there are plenty of lanes(34) that are maintained accordingly for the several leagues set up throughout the week. the oil used on the lanes are real bad however. it seems heavily oiled so when your ball returns, you get all this grease on your hands. really disgusting actually.the nice part about this place is that it's brand new. the bowling area is small but is very clean, and modern. it also seems like the owners are trying to preserve it as much as possible before it breaks down into the familiar dirty, rundown bowling alley like most bowling alleys become.i really don't like the user interface. it's really confusing and hard to follow but i guess it can be really cool and entertaining to kids.prices are fair but lookout for specials such as $1/game wednesdays all day.the highlight of this bowling alley is the bar. it is a large area which could be it's own building. there is also a wide variety of beers on tap(over 50 or 60) with some good specials and <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> throughout the week.
<a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.chaparral300.com%2fcontent%2fprice.html&amp;s=b01b2c565111492db515124dfc043bdd02d4132e015230b2cb352f0f332ba67a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chaparral300.com/content…</a>first of all let me just say, i have never been to this bowling alley before. i have heard/read several negative reviews from friends and yelp*. i decided to check this place out for myself and make my own determination. with that said:i went to the above website. as the prices were more than a little confusing ($4.50 all day, $8 from this time to that time, then $15 from $10:30pm on). i called the facility and spoke with a gentleman who would rather argue with a potential customer about who was right and who was wrong about pricing, then proceeded to ask me if i was sure i on the chino hills site and not the san dimas site. while he was on the phone, i found the site he was talking about. <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fchaparral300.com%2findex-1.html&amp;s=1c9cbbf347b0d51353e6cf5910860b786a452793fe4a3b948848e3973b75a41f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chaparral300.com/index-1…</a>both sites are chino hills sites with different pricing. needless to say, i will not be patronizing establishment for bowling, pool, parties, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or anything else they offer. all because their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. i would rather go to oak tree lanes in diamond bar. it's a little further, a lot older facility, but with a friendlier staff and clear pricing that is not as convoluted as chaparral 300 in chino hills. too bad, because this place in is my own backyard and i really wanted to like it.
daves-on-broadway-glendale
decided to try this place out the other night. i love dive bars and this place seemed like just that! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, great people-watching and the bartender lj was the best!
stopped in here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> the other day. my wife thought it was a tiki bar....but its not! haha!it was kinda divey, with a pool table and free (i think they were free) hot dogs.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices were good- a couple of different beers for $1 and stiff drinks for $5.we sat at the bar and caught a little buzz.i'm sure we'll stop by again at some point.
glendale's og barfull bar, friendly service, chill mature atmosphere, karaoke, live music, open mic, and free pool sundays, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, bar pool table and smoking alley.
fun times! an eclectic crowd and (yes) a pool table. . ..cold drinks served right...juke box tight....great little hole in the wall...the only disadvantage is the lack of parking...but this was our first time here...we may have missed alternative parking....however, we found a spot a block away...well worth the walk...3.00 budweiser, free hot dog and chips during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. we will be back!
dave's on broadway is one of those dark, seedy looking bars with great deals. so if you're a hipster in glendale looking for a place to enjoy your pabst, this is it. $3-4 well drinks during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is sweet (because they pour like they mean it). they have a pool table and self-serve hot dogs too (at least when we went).
now i'm a fan of dive bars, never been one for the scenester places where the yuppies tend to congregate. and finding daves just so happened to be of random occurence than of actually looking for it.i got done with homework early at gcc, took the #3 beeline down to glendale and broadway, and was patiently waiting on the southwester corner of the intersection, and i looked behind me...and there was dave's bar. i said fuck it and went in to see what kind of beers they had. this was on a monday, and it just so happened to be about 4:30pm and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 4-7pm mon-friday(with kareoke on fridays too!)so i took a place at the bar, and a bartender named ray came up and asked me what i would like..he was quick on this question so i just blurted out &quot;newcastle&quot;...a chilled pint glass and a frosty nukey was in front of me in no time. &nbsp;as i was pouring it he told me there was pizza if i wanted some by the dart board. &nbsp;that's right...pizza! oh...and it was for free.so i said &quot;thanks!&quot; and went and got a slice, some cookies were there too, and just sat enjoying my beer and watching the crowd of mostly older gentleman. &nbsp;finishing my newcastle in timely fashion, i ordered a guinness, was watching two older guys play pool and talk shit to eachother, i even helped them call shots! it was a fun time, and before i knew it 3 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> had passed.good prices, on beer, i payed $4 per import beer(make sure to tip!), i'm assuming domestics would be about 3-3.50 a bottle. &nbsp;check out the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;you'll have a good time just relaxing. &nbsp;daves bar=a good time.
hahah! oh, i love dave's bar!!i remember rushing out of work 3 years ago just to make it for last call!my friends and i, about 21 yrs old, were always so loud and rowdy - i wouldn't have been surprised if they had us kicked out serval times! but noo!! this bar is not your typical &quot; cool &quot; bar.. it was like the neighborhood bar with regulars, old men, quiet, and juke box music. they were not bias, judge mental, rude and etc! very very accommodating staff!i've visited frequently since and i can say it's still welcoming.before i forget, they also have a pool table! it doesn't get very crowded so you'll definitely have a short wait. you pay per game as oppose to per <span class="highlighted">hour</span> so it doesn't get expensive..dave's bar has all sorts of daily specials and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals. worth it, check it out (;
corner-bar-burbank
this place was nice. i went here after work on a wednesday with some co-workers to celebrate my birthday. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is limited but the prices are good. i had a cocktail and shared steak and fries and spent about $15 with tip. it wasn't too loud and a very chill environment.
$2 beer non <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> la beer? &nbsp;i didnt even that existed anymore. good job corner bar. why no 5 star? you need 1-2 pool tables and country music to be a true dive bar
i come here pretty often with fairly large groups on thursdays. the best part about this joint is the crowd. no creepers! everyone is there to relax and mind their own business. good priced drinks and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is until 7pm. marty, our usual bartender, treats us real well every time and makes strong drinks! no frills about this place. not much decor. low lighting. generic everything. but very clean. it's just a chill place with no bullshit. thursdays are karaoke nights. not really fan of it because it gets way too loud in there... and the reason why i like this place is because of the low noise level.
came on a thursday, at like 7:01...thankfully, the bartender was nice enough to let us still order a drink during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ( 5-7pm; dollar off drinks ). &nbsp;wasn't much of a crowd, but it was cute, with a christmas tree and all. was craving some thai food, so i left, but i would have loved to stick around for karaoke, which apparently is on thursdays.nice feel, but nothing to get all dolled up for. &nbsp;wouldn't drive out of my way for it, but if it was in my neighborhood, then i'd probably stop by again.
we'd gone on a thursday around 6pm. &nbsp;there were a few locals in there but we had the place literally to ourselves! &nbsp;kinda dark, but i like dark dives. &nbsp;:)drinks were good in my book, bartender knew how to make a good tanqueray and tonic (and the tonic wasn't flat). &nbsp;prices were very reasonable and we got a dollar off each drink, apparently it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.i'd go again and check it out! &nbsp;reminded me of the blue room but more of a mahogany color and w/o the cool patio. &nbsp;their smoking section didn't look so hot.
roscoes-famous-deli-chino-hills
this is a wonderful place. i'm just sorry we're going here for lunch during work <span class="highlighted">hours</span> cuz the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is fantastic! tall drinks o water and when i mean water i mean beer!
tried the place out on sunday for lunch. pretty cool classic car decor &amp; pretty good lunch food to match! they have a big bar that looks like it could be fun for night time or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &amp; a patio that had some live classic rock band playing. they serve pretzels while you wait at your table, and i got the chicken sandwich - it had avocado and sun dried tomato, with cole slaw and fruit. i liked it. the drinks were huge! fun place to hang out and the people that worked there seemed friendly to me! they also have a deli you can walk up to and order stuff to go.
&quot;roscoe's rocks my socks!&quot;not to be mistaken w/ chicken &amp; waffles. this place is all about the sammiches! ginormous...delicious...sammiches! practically everything on the menu - entr&eacute;es, appetizers, salads and drinks, are served super-sized! and if you're a big sports fanatic, well then this is the place to be at during game-day. i don't know why it took me song long to try this place. my husband and i came in on a friday evening (and again on sunday!) hoping to score good seats for the laker game. we had just come from buffalo wild wings and that was a total fail. hella crowded and the wait-time was ridic!!! surprisingly it wasn't too crowded at roscoe's and we found seats at the bar right away. what's great about this place is no matter where you sit or what angle you're facing, you've got a good view of the game. started off with a round o' beers and a free bag o' peanuts. they had about 25-30 beers on tap. we likey! i tell ya, there's no better way to drink a cold beer than in a big, frosty mug. and i'm talkin' huge manly mugs! a 64oz stella for the hubby and a 40oz black velvet for me. so crisp and refreshing! the 40oz is served in a chalice, which made me feel very royale! now, onto the food! i ordered the martini - grilled chicken breast, mozzarella cheese, lettuce, tomato, drizzled with a balsamic glaze and pesto mayo, sandwiched between two thick slices of grilled parmesan bread (like sizzlers!). can you say ... omgawd-licious! it was soooo friggin' good that i had to take my eyes off the game for a bit and savor the awesomeness that was going on in my mouth. wow. one of the best sammiches i've ever had and for $11.95, hell it was worth every penny! my husband ordered the wfc burger ($11.95)...loved it! when we came back for sunday's game, he ordered the classic patty melt ($10.95) and said that it was just as good as the wfc! i agree! i just couldn't resist, i ordered my martini again...mmm. all burgers and sammies comes with a slice of pickle and one side. one huge side that is. for the tinier appetites, you have the option of splitting w/ a buddy. there's a $2 split-charge, but... you still get a full-sized portion of your side and you and your buddy can choose different sides! the curly fries are fantastic (w/ lots of ranch) and the onion rings and macaroni salad were seriously, the best i've ever tasted. i hear their house chips are pretty bomb too. everything we tried was super! the prices aren't cheap but imo, very reasonable, especially for the quality and quantity! special shout-outs to our two awesome waiters/bartenders, cody and michael. thank you for your top-notch service, your friendly smiles, and for making them killer drinks! can't believe you guys don't have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...bummer. roscoe's deli has all the elements of what me and my hubby look for in a sports bar - great food, full bar w/ a good selection of beers on tap, awesome service, big-screen tvs (w/ audio during games!), and a very laker-friendly staff and atmosphere. sill luv heroes in claremont but roscoe's is now our new fav sports bar...and it's much closer to home! yay!***live entertainment on weekends out on the patio***breakfast served on sundays 'til 1pm***atm on site
my daughter &amp; i went yesterday, the service was bad!!!!!!we ordered the pastrami &amp; chile fries,the bread was soggy w/ mustard &amp; the chile was bad my daughter would not eat them ...mind you an 8 year old who loves chile fries.....will never go again!!!!!!!!!!!!!i was so <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to have a deli that we could go eat like in l.a....i will drive the <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to l.a ...i am into quality not quantity !!!!
wow, what a great experience tonight, my wife and i were in the area and we have heard about roscoe's so we had to stop by and give it a try. i was pleasantly surprised as we walked in as i loved the atmosphere with many tv's each playing a different game and a overall look of the place that was part grease monkey and part old basement treasures. if i had a unlimited budget for a man cave i would hire their designer. our food came to us quickly, i ordered the godfather and my wife ordered the slim, wow, the portion sizes were so large that we only finished half of our sandwiches, we could have been perfectly <span class="highlighted">happy</span> by ordering one sandwich between the two of us, i'm a heavy eater and it has now been 3 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> after we left and i'm still full. the quality of the food was top notch with wonderful meats breads and cheeses, heck, i would put up with poor service for such great food and large portions, but we didn't have to, the service was very good and they really took care of us. i will be back next time we are out there.
hyperion-public-los-angeles
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>--great service, perfect sliders, and good selection of beer. will definitely be back.
stick to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. brunch is just not good here. underwhelming. drinks and dinner/appetizers at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are great. i've also had some really snotty servers here. over it.
yummy! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. their brussell sprout salad is insanely good - they roast the brussells. so yum. i also love the omg dip and the soft pretzel.
went to the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the selections were a lot less than previous reviews. &nbsp;i believe they took off some items on the menu. &nbsp;foods on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu aren't that good for the price ~$7 to $8 (small portions and quality-wise). &nbsp;i'd give <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu food a 3 star. &nbsp;the staff are very friendly, so i bump it up to +1 star. &nbsp;so more like a 3.5 star joint, but since they've got free valet and small parking in the back (although i didn't realize it at the time and found street parking) it's alright.
good food decent prices for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sliders were ok wings were really good i got the spicy wings. deviled eggs were not that great.
went on two occasions: <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and breakfast/brunch. i would go back for the brunch but <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are on the high side for what you get. food portions were small and drink prices were on the high side.
love hyperion public. it's sooooo close to my house and my workplace. they always have the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal! my coworkers took me out and i must say i had such a great time and they're food was so delicious. pretty much anything on the menu you can't go wrong with!!!
only came here for the drinks. the cocktails looked good but come on, 13 dollars for a cocktail in silverlake? ridiculous. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sounds like a better bet, or stick with the beers, though 6 dollar cans is also pretty crazy.
hyperion public is a great spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if you're in the silverlake area. they have three areas of the restaurant. two of them are outside along the sidewalk of hyperion &amp; the other is inside. they have a fun ambient atmosphere with lots of little edison lights, wood &amp; greenery. ok the more important part.... food. during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they have lots of different things to try ranging from $3-$5. i tried the turkey burger sliders with havarti, the fried chicken sandwich with their bacon coleslaw &amp; the greek quinoa salad. all were fantastic!as for the cocktails, i tried the margarita &amp; the jalape&ntilde;o stoli cocktail (can't remember the name, eek!). both we're lacking sugar. if you're someone who prefers this, then you're in luck! both drinks were $7 on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu.mid-way through we met tom, the manager. tom was such a sweetheart, very knowledgable of everything on the menu. loved that he came to say hello to us all the way outside down the street! overall, fantastic little spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. great neighborhood &amp; a very genuine staff!
super easy, casual, great food and drinks and they have a fantastic <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. great if you want to start drinking early or watch a game. overall this is just a pleasant spot to be in. head towards the back.
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot! tentative 4 stars until i come back (which i definitely will) and try more of the menu.the two <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cocktails i tried were the &quot;dark &amp; stormy&quot; and the &quot;flaming greyhound&quot;. the d&amp;s was meh, nothing too spectacular, but the greyhound was really, really good. they use stoli and a flavorful jalapeno to balance out a lightly spicy drink that's decently strong with a good kick. i'd definitely get this drink again.i also tried the crab cakes and sliders on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. sliders were good, nothing crazy there (don't think anyone is ever really disappointed or impressed by sliders though...). the crab cakes though! really solid crab cakes. i make a pretty mean crab cake appetizer myself so i was really <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to find out that they use a similar recipe to my own. sriracha aioli is always a plus too.super dark venue (apologize for the grainy pic!) and the noise level isn't bad. reasonable prices, excellent service (our waitress was really nice and patient), and fun place to go after work. can't wait to come back!
just missed <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> by a few minutes last night, but they made up for it because they just opened a new side patio area outside. pretty chill, though they were playing npr on a radio instead of music, which was a funny and very silver lakey choice.i ordered a stone and my friend got a cocktail that was okay. decent prices, good ambiance. i'd come back to check out the food and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for sure.
this place is totally dark and tavern-esque. cool spot! came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $1 off beers and $4 wines. had a couple of great eats. definitely recommend the popcorn cauliflower and the something cobb brussell sprouts.
probably my favorite place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in silverlake!! they have great menu selection and a list of yummy cocktails that don't skimp on the alcohol and definitely do not disappoint. i enjoyed &nbsp;everything i ordered, and trust me, i ordered quite a bit!! my favorite was definitely the lettuce wraps -- they were super yummy!! the chicken wings were a close second, nice and spicy and perfectly sauced. the ambiance is trendy and laid back, the tables and furniture are very attractive, and they have the specials written on a chalk board. we walked in with 5 minutes left of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and the staff was still extremely accommodating and the waitress made sure we ordered in time, which was very appreciated. they could have easily taken their time seating us and getting our order in so to make us pay full price, but she took care of us. i will definitely be recommending this place to friends, and coming here for regular <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>! i can't wait to come at night and actually eat dinner! if the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food is good, you can bet they take good care with their full priced meals!
sunday brunch is my absolute favorite! i had the pleasure of dining at hyperion public for brunch and bottomless mimosas. i really like the different options from regular mimosas to &quot;the rock&quot;. i offered the hyperion burger which was mouthwatering and so delicious. our waitress was attentive and very sweet. they had a great crews on sunday. the get a round of applause for the music. they had me at adele &quot;hello&quot; lol. i would definitely recommend this for brunch and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
came here two weeks in a row- the hyperion burger, hot wings and fries hit alllllll of the spots. service was great both times, once a sunday afternoon bartender took care of us upstairs and the other time was a really nice girl on a thursday during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. glad this place has it together.
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on wine and beer and the hh food menu is yummy! i love the bar area in the back, plenty of seating and a great place to chill with a group of friends.
last week my friend suggested we meet at hyperion public for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i'm so glad she did! i had no idea this place existed! &nbsp;before a certain time, you can park for free in the back. follow the driveway to the left of the restaurant. after around 5pm the valet sets up and the back lot is for valet only. when you enter the restaurant you will be in the main dining area with a small bar at the back of the room. to my surprise there was another loungy bar to the right past the dining room bar area which is dark and quaint. they have a bigger bar and some booths/tables and a bunch on televisions playing sports.they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3 to 7$4 glass of wine (both white and red), they have beer and well drinks at around the same price too.fries - good snackchicken wings - awesome, get them extra spicy!crab cake - 2 tiny pieces, not worth it.salted caramel pie was a little too sweet for our liking.service was good, i loved the ambiance and i liked the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices, what more can you ask for?
friend and i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which seemed okay, i didn't see too many choices that i wanted for their price. however, we decided to split the f yeah fries which has their spicy, cheesy, chicken-y dip poured around fries with bacon which was such a good decision! it was the perfect blend of flavors and so filling, and the chicken was nicely threaded throughout so it wasn't too chunky. even after having it sit out awhile when our appetites slowed down, the fries retained a crunchy exterior and pillowy interior, i don't know how! would definitely go back just for these. my friend also ordered the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> serving of blueberry chicken wings and really liked them. she likened them to sweet bbq sauce, and said they had a nice crisp exterior. get the f yeah fries!!!
love, love, love this place! they have hendrick's on tap as their well gin. does it get any better? oh, yes it does. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> rocks. the lettuce cups, 4 cheese mac, and crabcakes are super tasty. as for the bar, it's got a great atmosphere. and a lovely staff, too.i'll be sure to come back again soon!
yes. this place is great. i've only be here 3 times and i've had a great experience every single time. the most memorable one was on a monday early evening in which we dropped in to catch the kings game. it was the last 10 minutes of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;we got a table top in the back lounge and the cocktail waitress was quick to assist us. she came over and immediately let us know that <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was ending soon and grabbed a few menus for us. she was very helpful by getting our drinks in, and then immediately returning to get our food in just in time. i really appreciate when a server takes time and goes out and beyond to do their job. that impressed me, i wish i remembered her name. haven't dropped by the back bar area in a while, but looking forward to coming back. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a great deal, not ridiculously cheap like others, but you can save a few bucks. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i love their cauliflower and their vegan burger.service is what keeps me coming back.
come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! great drink and food specials. i had a really good moscow mule for like $5. and honestly, the best grilled cheese i've ever had. their salads are delicious and big, their avocado fries are amazing, their cauliflower tempura is great too! you really can't go wrong. i would suggest ordering a bunch of alittle things and sharing, because there is a lot to try. sometimes you can get lucky with parking. ive been over there a few times now and never had to valet. you migh thave to circle around a few times or walk a block or two. this is a cool little cozy place. dark inside. a few seats outside. definitly worth checking it out for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
hyperion public is one of the best spots around for sure! they have a super awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu for drinks and food! wings are my absolute favorite and they have the best hands dowwwwnnn. meghan was my waitress and she was super sweet along with all the other waitstaff. great for any occasion-especially if you're trying to catch a game :)
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great and the ladies that work at the back bar upstairs are really sweet and friendly. &nbsp;the cocktail list is also varied and delicious. i have sat in the front and outside. &nbsp;the servers in the front seem less friendly and annoyed with work.... in the back is way better. it is dark though, but the round booths rule.
if you want to relive the 90s this place is for you. the bar is appropriately dark and comfortable and the drinks solid but the soundtrack is bro 90s and the food overcooked, overfried dullness. the restaurant is brighter but suffers from the same poor quality food and typical big room, look over function noisiness. they do have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> however.
3-7pm <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on fridays came in handy for appetizer foods. everything was delicious, but sliders were a little lackluster. service got pretty slow when we changed servers, but i forgive them, because the ambiance and most of the food was great.
new fave! highlights include:monday is build a burger night... five dollars!! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> till 7, fantastic signature cocktails for seven dollars! mac &amp; so much cheesebanana pudding! i dieample indoor and outdoor seatingsuper friendly staffextensive beer selectioncurrently showing all world cup gamesi can't even think of 1 thing i didnt like. well done hyperion public, well done.
i went here for la dine in week. decided to order off the menu since i'm not really a dessert person. good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $4 glasses of red wine. its a modest pour tho. don't expect an over flowing glass. we didn't order off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, but it looked well priced and the selection looked good. for dinner i ordered the fried chicken. its a solid good. not excellent, not spectacular, but good. my friend ordered the steak. it was fine. the bartender who was also our waiter completely oversold it to be as tender as a fillet mignon. not even close. but it was fine. the fries that came with it were delicious tho. the over ambiance of the restaurant was nice. super comfortable and leads for a great conversation place with friends. unfortunately our server/bartender was completely personality lacking. overall, i had a nice night. definitely would come back, but not on my top 10 list.
3 1/2 stars. came here for the first time to watch a game and for some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food. there is street parking and valet for $3.00. the inside is cozy and hip. more of a sit down and restaurant feel. the upstairs is way more of a bar and sports bar feel. lot's of big tv for games, a bar, and couple of high tables and chairs. it's pretty dark upstairs. and it can get a bit stuffy when it gets crowded. the second time i came here was for my girlfriends birthday. it happened to be the same day as the king's win the stanley cup, woot woot!! so you can say it was pretty packed. i was pretty hungry so my gf and i just went down to get some actual dinner instead of finger foods. although the food is just okay it is great for drinks, watching the game and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> bar food._avocado fries. pretty good. nothing great. i personally like my avocados non fried but this was good with the cool lime aioli dip. good to get for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>._pan seared crab cakes. got this from raved reviews for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it was horrible! worst crab cakes ever! maybe it was that day but wow. the crab cake was extremely salty and mushy. tasted like it was still a raw and they were getting ready to fry it. had to return as it was just uneatable. _heirloom tomato &amp; burrata. this was just okay. the tomato was not that fresh and in overall it just tasted like something you could have easily made at home._f yeah fries. this was a bit too rich and cheesy for me. the fries were smothered in cheese so it got soggy pretty quick. _crispy buttermilk fried chicken ($17) bacon slaw, naughty &amp; nice sauce. this was a great entree. the fried chicken was moist, nicely fried and comes in 4 big pieces. the slaw was just okay. a bit too much dressing. but the sauce which was some blueberry preserve was amazing!!! simple yet tasted so great with the chicken. a tad sweet but not overpowering. i used that sauce with everything! a little overpriced but damn that sauce was well worth it. _fried chicken sandwich ($13) breaded white meat, bacon coleslaw, best relish ever. this was just soso. i expected it to be great from reviews and although the chicken itself was great the bread was a miss. it was soggy and did not have that nice toasted crunch. in the end i just took out the chicken and dipped it in that amazing sauce. overall i would come here for drinks and just to spend time with friends but not really for a great dining experience. although i would come back to get the fried chicken and amazing sauce and maybe try some other things off the menu.
i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with my sister and her colleagues and had such a great experience. 1) food: we ordered the crab cakes, lettuce wraps, avocado fries, pretzel with omg dip and a quinoa salad. all incredible. the meat in the lettuce wraps was so flavorful and juicy.2) ambience: it wasn't very busy, which was surprising but no big deal. the dim lights and soft music made it really easy for us to engage in good convo.3) service: the service is what made me write this review. jade was our server and he was so damn cool. he was super attentive, funny and just friendly as hell. we stayed for about 30-40 minutes after paying and most servers just totally ignore you after you pay but he was still asking us if we needed anything. we also had conversations with who i assume was the manager (i didn't get his name but he has a pretty awesome beard), and he was great, too.i recommend this place, hands down. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> had good prices ($5 wine, $1 off draft beers and $7 cocktails) and the service was top-notch. i hope to come watch a game here soon!
i've been here a couple times with my paisans for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;we sit up top in the back bar. &nbsp;kinda dark, kinda cozy. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beer selections are ok - nothing special.the appetizers aren't all that hot either. wings are no good. fries are ok. crab cakes have been soggy both times we ordered them.do not order dinner here. trust me. i got that diablo pork - it was barely cooked, the spices on it were gross, and the portion of the arugula pinyon is tiny (and was cold). i can't remember what my boys ordered, but everybody was disappointed - i do remember that - and we're pretty easy to please.this place is gonna shut down soon if they don't get their act together in the kitchen. &nbsp;it'd be a shame cuz it's a nice lookin' place.
a true neighborhood pub!we go to hp a few times a week. &nbsp;their brunch is great, their menu is awesome and well priced - perfect portions and tasty treats. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great and has a rotating number of nibbles as well as some solid standby's like hot wings and deviled eggs. &nbsp;spend a little time there and the staff will get to know you and vice versa. &nbsp;they sponsor local activities and generally are a great addition to the neighborhood. &nbsp;my fianc&eacute; and i are both ex-brooklynites and we always feel right at home at 'the pub.'
i've been looking for a solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> place in silverlake, and by george, i think i've done it! &nbsp;covertly located on the busiest strip of hyperion ave, amongst other stand-out eateries like barbarella and lucky duck, i've driven past it many times without noticing it's existence. &nbsp; they boast a great selection of libations and the food is everything i have ever hoped for in a gastropub. &nbsp;the interior is dark and moody, with lots of wood and deep colors. &nbsp;there are large tables for big groups as well as booths for more intimate get-togethers. &nbsp;the front area is more like a gastropub and the back room has more of a bar feel. &nbsp;it is loud enough that i can burst into inebriated laughter without disturbing the peace and getting the stink eye, but still quiet enough that i can have a serious conversation with a good friend. the food, as i previously mentioned, is awesome. &nbsp;some stand out items on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu are:-lettuce cups: &nbsp;divine. &nbsp;the meat to lettuce ratio is commendable and the cilantro garnish and slaw adds a wonderful element of freshness and texture. &nbsp;the meat is incredibly flavorful and tender, like a nugget of the best marinated korean barbeque your imagination can fathom.-fried chicken sandwich: delish. well spiced , light breading and huge. &nbsp;i could tell the chicken breast was freshly breaded and fried.-chicken wings: omg. tantilizing. spicy is definitely spicy. &nbsp;they have other exotic flavors like thai and blueberry. &nbsp;definitely fresh and succulent. &nbsp;served with a side of ranch (so fresh, i could taste the herbs) or blue cheese.the drinks are also unique and delicous. &nbsp;the spicy greyhound is a specialty cocktail on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and it is sweet and refreshing with a nice, unexpected kick from the jalapeno. try it. the service here is fantastic! &nbsp;the servers are attentive and amiable. &nbsp;the food comes out with adequate speed and drinks are refilled graciously. &nbsp;i look forward to broadening my hyperion public experience and coming back for dinner.
i have heard a lot of buzz about this place. i am sorry to admit my first experience was not what i was hoping.service: &nbsp;i was greeted by a friendly bartender in the upper back bar and decided it was a bit too dark for the afternoon meeting. he poured us our pints and mentioned it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and we can sit wherever we wanted. &nbsp;we went downstairs and ordered our <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food and enjoyed our time until...halfway through our meal the bartender in the downstairs area interrupted us and said &quot;this is awkward but just to let you know you will not be getting <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices in this room&quot; i told him the bartender upstairs said we could sit anywhere and took our order. &nbsp;he said sorry and walked away.what! unacceptable service.vibe: a bit generic, but a good solid hang out spot. food: deviled eggs ok, sliders had nice flavors with the hawaiian bread. &nbsp;time and date: 4/25 about 4pm in the afternoon
this place has a cool atmosphere, great outdoor seating and nice bar in the back, but i wish they had more food selections and their prices were a bit lower. the lowest costing sandwich is a grilled cheese - $12. if i pay 12 bucks for a grilled cheese that mofo should be a glorious grilled cheese. however, judging by the area and crowd that frequents this place $12 is probably nothing, but it adds up when youre drinking. their food is always on point though. the burger is great, hot wings, thai wings both pretty good. don't pass up their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or you'll be spending quite a lot.
this is a super fun place to meet friends at, watch sports, party on a weekend or stop in for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> refreshment. they offer yummy bar bites and you can see a tv from where ever you sit in the back bar. definitely a great neighborhood hang.
went here with my coworker for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. parking: it's the silver lake area so naturally, it sucks. you can valet though. ambiance: nice vibe. friendly staff. another room to get rowdy when watching fuuuuzball. loved their wooden decor.drinks: had their old fashioned. pretty damn strong for a $5 drink. well worth it.food: started off with the hot wings. pretty darn good. not as spicy as i would have liked it, but i'm thai and i have a completely different palate when it comes to spice. i then proceeded to order the hyperion burger. i love it when i'm asked how i want my burger cooked. i'm not stuck with an overdone piece of hockey puck. i'm a rare-mid rare type of gal. let me tell you... did not disappoint! giant slabs of applewood smoked bacon. bacon makes everything better. huge burger. bun was on point. juices were running. perfection. and ended it with a salted caramel pie. need i say more? i love pie. i love caramel. tis all. will def come back.
pretty darn impressive. we were there around 5 and it quickly filled up. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is very impressive...!! we had a few cocktails, olympia is a hh beer and a tasty chardonnay as well. i had the crab cakes... again very good.. my guy had the wings, beef sliders and deciles eggs. generally i'm a vegetarian, but beef calls to me and a few times a year i give in. these sliders are outstanding! &nbsp;we wanted more but probably didn't need the truffle macand cheese, it's a meal in itself. we sang wait tiger back for the rest. incredible for the area, their pricing is fair also!
i've lived across the street from hyperion public for a year now and in that time i've consistently been pleasantly surprised by their food, drinks and atmosphere. adding a killer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was a great move and i've definitely been going there a lot more since that addition. their wings are amongst the best i've had in los angeles, the f yeah fries are fantastic and i love their salads. i also like that their brunch menu has a good variety of both breakfast and lunch foods, not just eggs 100 different ways like so many brunch spots in the area. sitting outside on the patio past the restaurant and smoking deck is lovely, but be prepared to have compromised service if that's where you chose to sit.
***3.5 stars***i went here for dinner and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a tuesday night. hp is super cute with benches and open windows. i love the look and feel of the place. i had a beer (some type of white ale and i loved it) and the turkey meatloaf dish. it was $10 tuesday so my turkey was only $10. it looked really good on the plate and was served with brussels sprout petals and i believe cauliflower puree. i loved the puree and sprout petals, although they really should of put more veg to balance out the meatloaf. the meatloaf was tasty and lean (no grease), however, it was very very salty (the gouda contributed to this). they also put sriracha aioli sauce on the side and even though it was good, i just felt like there was too much going on with this dish. if it was less salty, i would of been even happier. portion wise, it was huge. i ate half and ate the other half for lunch the next day. onto the service--it was excellent. everyone was super friendly and attentive. i'll be back since it's a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot. there's street parking but that fills up fast so there's always free valet and you just have to tip the guy.
my favorite part of hyperion public is their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sliders. i also like the smoking patio. otherwise, i could take it or leave it. i find it to be inconsistent. take the truffle mac 'n cheese for example -- the first time i tried it i was blown away. the flavor and texture were spot on. nice, not overwhelming, truffle flavor with a crunchy top and creamy middle. second time i ordered it? almost inedible: watery, brown, grainy and with an overpowering truffle flavor. i'd love to order the first one again, but i really don't want to wind up with the second time one. sliders are really good, and so are the sesame wings. not a fan of their signature cocktails. haven't had one i like. i live close by so i will probably continue to go. hopefully they can work out the inconsistent kitchen kinks.
i like this place a lot. it's a good neighborhood spot that works for a meal downstairs or some drinks with a group upstairs. the food seems to get better all the time. i've especially loved their cauliflower pur&eacute;e as a side and the quinoa risotto. also, i could eat a dozen of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> turkey burger sliders. i wish they didn't get rid of allagash black on draft, but i can understand why a niche belgian stout from maine would get expensive to keep on the menu. keep up the good work.
woot! i love neighborhood bars! i visited the public a week ago and ended up enjoying tasty food, cheap drinks, and sang karaoke?!yes, you heard me. i was singing iron maiden at the top of my lungs on a casual thursday night that turned into a party session. the staff was super nice, and the vibe is very casual. so if you're a local, this is a nice spot to cruise into after work for a fun <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and some tasty eats. i had their french fries so far, but a friend had a burger that looked monstrous! i'll be heading back for sure, and i do like that they have a little upstairs bar for you to hide in! only con: it got a bit warm up there.. relax on the heat!
i'm seriously so proud to call this my &quot;my-go-to-right-down-the-street bar!&quot;i can only speak about three things on the menu because it was the only three things that we ordered during our time there. drinks were mostly the priority (some can be pricey, but i hear during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that they have some pretty decent deals).silverlake grilled cheese- bacon and blueberries?! seriously, who are you and how did you come up with this deliciousness?! beignet bites-huge shout out to cheryl, who is by the way one of the friendliest servers at hyperion public, for introducing these little clouds of heaven! f-yeah fries- not one of my favorites, but the boys loved them. i'm also biased because i'm not a very big fan of buffalo sauce. i did find myself constantly picking and eating them....it must have been the beer making me more hungry....or maybe it was the fries? such a mystery. staff-you guys are soooo cool! we were able to chat a bit with danny and cheryl at the bar and both are just super rad! thanks for the awesome service and the great company!
i've heard good things about this place many times. tonight, i drove by and noticed a big ol' parking spot right in front just waiting for me. it was a sign for me to stop and have a drink.valet is not free! it is $3!there are seats outside and more in the back, along with another bar. anyway, i strolled on in and was greeted by the bartender and a friendly waitress. the place is dimly lit and gives off that &quot;sexy&quot; vibe. it's a perfect place for a date or for a casual night with friends. i ordered a 'salted pisco peach lemonade' which was absolutely delicious and stiff, just the way i like it!after that, i asked the bartender, sam, if he could make something for me that was not on the cocktail menu. he asked me if i liked ginger beer and i told him i had never tried it before. he let me have a little sip of their house ginger beer and i loved it (i love ginger, though). sam told me this drink was part of their old menu and called it the &quot;mescal mule.&quot; bottom line: the drinks were stiff and delicious. the service was great and i was able to find parking outside.i will give it another try next time for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
i enjoy this place. i prefer the bar area, love the big booths and dim lighting. sometimes they are playing a super cool old classic movie. other times its karaoke and pretty hilarious, except when you get that one person who just takes life and karaoke too seriously- beyotch, don't kill everyone's vibe... its also really nice to sit outside if the weather permits, which is like almost all the time. decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i haven't had a ton of their dishes but what i have had has always been really good! let's see, what else? &nbsp;i've had shitty attitude bartenders and also very nice service on my visits so it depends on who's working i guess... hopefully you don't get one of the super skinny pretentious guys working behind the bar. :/ whomp whomp if you do. good food &amp; drinks. i need to try out brunch! &nbsp;they offer valet parking but lots of street parking as well.
came here on a wednesday night and ordered two orders of the crab cakes, the turkey sliders, and the lettuce cups off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu.the crab cakes were the best in our opinion. two come in an order and they were soft and not dry. the sauce that comes with it was a nice touch to add a creamy note to the savory and sweet flavors of the crab meat and spices. the turkey sliders were a disappointment. the hawaiian bread they used was alright but the turkey meat was dry and overall it almost felt reminiscent to what i could've have gotten out of a frozen dinner.the lettuce cups were pretty good. the first bite was full of flavor, but that might have been a little of a problem. because there were so many flavors in the marinade of the meat and the mixture of sauces, it felt a bit overpowering by the second bite. that said however, i still finished the lettuce cup with ease after taking bites of our other orders. my friend also ordered the whiskey sour. verdict was that it was pretty good, but not as strong as expected.now the best part of the night was that after a while, we were told that bingo was about to start. we ended up playing a few rounds and won some ridiculous prizes. so if you're going to go to the bar, go on wednesday night. the guys working there are a lot of fun and friendly. overall, we had a really good time and chilling, talking, and playing games.
eat at home. 5 stars as a pub -- <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good, beers are reasonably priced with a good selection, and the cocktails aren't going to break the bank. the scene is solid, decor is good, and enough tv's to watch a game without it being too overwhelming. 1 star as a restaurant -- seems like they're going for indulgence/sloppy salty greasy comfort food. with the exception of the homemade potato chips, i have yet to get a meal here that is anything better than mediocre. that whole sloppy/salty/greasy thing can be done well, but you just end up with a bland mess that screws up your stomach without the satisfaction of real comfort food. so yeah -- eat at home or any of the other restaurants in the area, then head there for a beer at their excellent pub.
this is definitely our new favorite local pub. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing (we always sit upstairs in the back bar area, which i love). &nbsp;round booths, friendly staff.. yes please!things that are delicious:kale salad= awesome. &nbsp;chicken wings= i haven't had them but it's my friends favorite food on the planet and he says they check out.deviled eggs= delicious. &nbsp;eat them with the lettuce wrapped around them... they're wonderful.turkey sliders= they're good. salmon= delicious. &nbsp;i'm always weary about ordering seafood at a bar (for obvious reasons), but i was craving it so what the hey. &nbsp;it was super fresh, cooked perfectly, and full of flavor.mac n' cheese- (what they say they're known for)... honestly, it's mac n' cheese. &nbsp;it comes out in a little ramekin and you eat it and it's good. &nbsp;it's not amazing or life changing or crave worthy... but it's still good. &nbsp;i had the truffle mac when i went once and slipped into a wonderful food coma after only a few bites.all in all, &nbsp;i love this place. &nbsp;it and jays bar are probably my two new favorites in the neighborhood. &nbsp;atmosphere is nice and airy in the front too. :)
lunch time!the ambiance:i had come to hyperion public before but late night for some drinks. i had a moscow mule and it was good. yesterday i came to check out their lunch menu. we tried the avocado fries($12; panko-crusted/ lime-cilantro aoli) &nbsp;as an appetizer and for entree i had the turkey burger ($14; house-made turkey patty/havarti/grilled onions/avocado/arugula/tomato) and he had the btla sandwich ($13; applewood bacon/avocado/romaine/tomato/sriracha aoili/toasted sourdough).the avocado fries were lightly breaded and i liked that. the turkey burger was just okay until i tasted the caramelization of the bun with the havarti cheese. that changed the flavor and it went from just okay to good. the ingredients tasted fresh. the btla was also good and he liked that it had a lot of bacon. the entrees came with a choice of fries or mixed greens. since we had the avocado fries we chose mixed greens. the mixed greens was exactly like the costco spring mix (maybe it is from costco) and they use a light dressing. when he was eating his salad he bit on a piece of wood and it hurt his tooth. we believe it was a piece of the stick they use to hold the sandwiches and burgers together. our server apologized and offered us a free dessert. he chose the salted caramel ice cream, which comes with chocolate pieces. i believe our server was the manager and he did a great job making sure we were taken care of.the tips:<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is monday-friday from 4-7pm. they have a set menu and it is $5 and under. also, bottomless mimosas every day until 3pm! &nbsp;lastly, they have karaoke on thursdays at 10pm. hmmm... might have to check that out. parking sucks in this area so just uber-it.
i've never written a poor review especially for a new establishment but alas i feel compelled. i went to hyperion public for the first time to experience the new neighborhood pub - but was not expecting a chucky cheese type atmo. there was a table w/4 kids which is not a big deal if they would have been well behaved. the kids were loud and literally running around the small restaurant like a play ground! it was so loud we couldn't converse. our meal was not cheap and for that i would expect the staff to discreetly admonish the parents. perhaps they were friends of the owners but still...i am paying here!! the food was pretty yummy and our server was fine but after this bad experience it will be a while before i go back. p.s. you can only get the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu if you eat in the sports bar annex.
the friends and i had dinner at hyperion public on a friday night. the good thing is that we all had never been here before so everyone's palate was a nice clean slate. the bad thing...my palate was restrained. as a practicing catholic i couldn't eat meat on fridays during lent, which means no steaks and no fried chicken for this girl.the dining area was relatively small. luckily we had reservations at 8pm so there was one long rectangular table in the middle for the 8 of us.brussels gratin - very tasty and crisp. can never go wrong with brussels sprouts.roasted mushroom quinoa salad - average-sized salad but is it worth $11? love arugula and cucumbers but the oregano vinaigrette made the dish taste rather sour.sea dog raspberry wheat ale - i really liked this beer. i don't necessarily drink beer but i do love a good wheat ale every once in awhile.our table also ordered the oh my goodness dip and pan-seared crab cakes. everyone raved about the appetizers but as far as the entrees--mediocre. the crispy fried buttermilk chicken was enjoyed by the bf but average for the others. the truffle mac n cheese was decent and very cheesy but was also very small for $11. our conclusion: hyperion public ideal for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and after-dinner drinks but not for a great meal. grab a bite to eat elsewhere.
i was really looking forward to trying this place. i passed it once and was drawn in by the big window and twinkling lights. when i found out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> runs until 7, i decided to finally check it out and made ressies on opentable.when we arrived, there were 'reserved' signs everywhere, including a row of empty tables. however, they decided to seat us at a small, cramped table between a family with small children and another party. uh...no. luckily, our server saw our hesitation and offered to move us without our asking. we finally sit down and i notice we weren't given a hh menu, so i had to ask for that after our first drink order was put in. hh deals range from $4 glasses of house wine, $2 off cocktails and lots of food items. i ordered the crab cakes, which were a bit salty. for dinner, i was debating between the winter kale salad or the vegan pot pie. i have to give them props for catering to all diets. i ended up with the salad, which was filling and good. but again, on the salty side. my bf has a thing for mac and cheese, so he ordered their special with bbq pulled pork. now if there's one requirement for good mac and cheese, it would be that it's....wait for it....cheesy. no brainer, right? well unfortunately, cheesy this was not. and the pork had bones in it. the drinks weren't much better. the dirty martini came out tasting like it was half filled with vermouth. good lord. i really, really wanted to like this place. but as we left, i told my bf my favorite thing about this place was the music. fail.
did we get a substitute chef? &nbsp;because the meal we had was an insult to actual gastropubs like village idiot. i'll give hyperion pub points for ambiance - it looks like a proper gastropub. but after eating the food and seeing the bill, i wasn't surprised the place was mostly empty at 8 pm. &nbsp;we had: truffle mac &amp; cheese - blessedly light on the truffle oil (maybe even too light - there was truffle oil in it?), the mac &amp; cheese was watery and thin... not at all creamy. more like a lightly cheesy rotini soup. the hyperion burger - meh. the beef was fine, but the bun was stale; the tomato was one of those watery, tasteless tomatoes you got in the school lunchroom and the bacon had a weird burnt-plastic taste. i should've opted for the fries... instead i got the healthy side salad, which turned out to be soggy greens drenched in dressing. the halibut - our mistake for ordering something healthy. the tiny bit of fish was overcooked and rubbery; the plate was swimming in tasteless lentils, and i think the julienned vegetables were actually raw, which made no sense.the beer and wine selection was good, but $11 for a tiny glass of joel gott cabernet is ridiculous - the whole bottle doesn't cost a lot more than that. our bill came to $90 for two people. i don't actually mind paying $90 for a good meal, but this one felt like i went to a bad dinner party and had my wallet stolen. my advice: go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and skip the food.
this place is for sure a hidden gem. i came here last saturday for my birthday brunch and did bottomless mimosas with &nbsp;5 other people. i reserved a table a head of time because i think it gets pretty poppin' here especially during brunch <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. bottomless mimosas: holy moly! this is the best thing ever! our server was wonderful. always coming back and asking us if we needed a refill or to grab a new pitcher of mimosas. the great part about their bottomless is that you get to mix and match different mimosas. they have grapefruit, watermelon, rose, mango bellini, and your classic mimosas.food: we ordered the f yea fries. after eating these fries, i now understand. delicious! a few people in a group ordered the breakfast burrito, the crab omelette, the chilaquiles, the fried chicken sandwich, deviled eggs. overall, everybody was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with their meal. i don't think it was extravagant or anything out of the ordinary, but everyone seemed to have a great time.i recommend this place for sure. nice, fun, and clean atmosphere.
i wanted to love this place, but didn't quite live up. i like the setup and i think it is a great space. the food was pretty good, a little over priced. the drinks were good but definitely over priced for football sunday. our waitress was trying but it really seemed like she was new to waitressing and messed up several times. i liked the darts so i know we will give it another try based on that alone. hopefully things will go a little better next time. i went with some friends at 10 am for football on sunday knowing that there was a chance i wouldn't get to see my game and of course i couldn't get it on as one of the four games - fine even though we were one of the first groups and it really didn't seem as though anyone was watching two of the games. the bartender says you know what i will make one of the tvs redzone and i said that will work thanks. the place started to get more crowded and clearly a lot of the people there were friends of the employees and the owner. all the sudden in the second half the bartender changes the redzone tv to some other game and i wasn't the happiest because that meant some person who came in 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> after me got their game on. so i asked about it and the bartender said the owner made me change it. she eventually changed one of the other tvs to redzone for me &nbsp;because she knew i had been there since they opened, which was nice of her. i know the owner was just trying to make his friends <span class="highlighted">happy</span> for coming to his bar but come on man you shouldn't be doing that when there is a bar full of people who have been there longer.

excellent food. lovely set up and affordable prices! plus a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. what more could you want?
updating to 4 stars. food is much better. staff are good. free food with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is $3 of call, premiums, elixirs and wine, 2$ off all beersfriday and saturday nights live music.casual environment, sit and work or catch up other friends this is the right place to be
laidhere to meet a friend for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>... great place! &nbsp;the bartender gave us a little sample of a new drink called a mexican mule. &nbsp;very nice! &nbsp;it is very open and laid-back atmosphere.the go-to place in atwater village.
came back because my friend and i were in the area and wanted some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and snacks. wine and cheese sounded fantastic, so we headed over to bon vivant (we were originally going to hit up atwater village tavern, but nothing looked super appealing on the menu).we walked in and headed straight for the bar. i will say the service was a bit slow at the beginning, but we ended up staying for 3 drinks each and we both order an app. i got the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cheese plate for $7, and it was so much food, i barely even ate a 1/3 of it.i will definitely be back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ;)
love the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>~ lot of food for a good price. and delicious. and the atmosphere is great. they have music tonight hopefully i stay long enough to listen to them. this is our 2nd visit and will def come back again.
having a cafe, a marketplace,and a restaurant with a full bar is quite interesting for bon vivant market &amp; cafe. &nbsp;upon entering this place with my best friend for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and studying time, i was awed by the extravagant halloween-themed decorations (spider webs, jack-o-lanterns) covering the entire place. &nbsp;if it weren't for my best friend telling me to go straight to the bar to get drinks first, i would have stayed in the same spot for a couple of minutes while staring at every decoration in complete detail. &nbsp;apparently, we can order beautiful desserts and coffee at one spot and order <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks ($3 off on most drinks except for beer that is only $2 off) at the bar, which is on the other side of the building by the way. &nbsp;next to the bar, however, is a bunch of free appetizers that are beautifully presented and can be taken brunch style. &nbsp;we decided to sit on the couch to eat our food, drink our alcoholic beverages, and go on our laptops to get our work done for a couple of <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. &nbsp;food was okay but not the best, drinks were great, service was friendly and attentive. &nbsp;overall, bon vivant market &amp; cafe seemed cozy and extravagant, but the layout was confusing for a cafe, a marketplace and a restaurant with a full bar in one building.
great menu, staff is so friendly and helpful! they have very good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, sometimes you'll find a live band playing which creates a nice vibe. i highly recommend their portobello mushroom burger, best i have ever had!
delicious! i brought a friend here yesterday, and we were both very pleased. we made it just in time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. our order:<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cheese plate ($7 and well worth it) <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> guac with shrimp ceviche ($6, the best guac i've ever had, but still a tad pricey)half duck sandwich ($8, my favorite item we ordered) lamb chops ($15, and the dark chocolate balsamic reduction was amazing)there are so many menu options i definitely suggest bringing a friend and splitting a few plates--plus we only spent about $20 each that way. the service was also fantastic. i love the causal walk up, and their cheese specialist was very helpful (bonus points: i forgot my phone on the table and he ran down the block to return it to me). thank you bon vivant!
wow their food is delic!!!!ambiance is hip, music chill, my kind of crowd.i am a regular here.breakfast was healthy and yummy.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is contagiously yum.dessert was nice, of course i must try the rest only had a chocolate chip cookie.
there are so many tasty options here, but if i go for brunch, i always get the smoked salmon sandwich with dill cream cheese and fresh pickles. &nbsp;it's just so good!the hubster gets the egg dishes, and pastries and is always <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. &nbsp;their sandwiches are fresh and tasty. &nbsp;the fries are well worth stealing.but i always come back to the salmon. &nbsp;for me, it's a bit of perfection.hope to check out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> soon!
review solely for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> -2 of us went there around 5pm on wed. drinks are 2 for 1 (same drink only!) so got 2 glasses of sparkling wine + 2 glasses of vodka+fresh cucumber cocktail-both were delicious!! also enjoyed their complimentary olives, american cheese plate+grilled cheese sandwich+a tasty tomato+basil salsa. finished off with 2 more glasses of vodka+cucumber cocktail. total bill was only $24 excl tip!! fyi, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is all day on wed!
we first found this place via groupon and that was a sweet deal. my friend and i stuffed ourselves silly and barely paid anything extra outside of the groupon. the staff was very friendly, the food was great, and the ambiance was pleasant. we definitely wanted to come back. we've been back several times since for brunch, lunch, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! i've gotta say we've always left <span class="highlighted">happy</span> and full, so no complaints here!
their salted butter alone is reason enough to go here! it's like crack spread on a delicious baguette. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are decent &amp; the food has really improved its taste since this place first opened. the prices are a little too high though, so i never ever eat here without a groupon or living social or amazon local coupon. they're all out there in cyberspace waiting to be picked up.
where do i start with this magical place? the alice in wonderland decor? the out of town feel right here in atwater? the fantasy themed armenian art on the walls? or maybe just the great food and coffee? and they show the dodger game on their tvs?? and they have beer and mimosas?? i have found my new favorite breakfast spot, and i will be back to try their lunch, and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during a dodger game too.
wonderful lunch (5 stars)just out of the blue on a saturday afternoon decided to have lunch at bon vivant.picked a glass of chimay blonde and croque madame sandwich with duck egg with fries, and a tuna sandwich with fries and sparking water.there were several open tables and a brief wait. it was a little busy as more than half the tables were occupied. the croque madame with duck egg was delicious, and the fries were absolutely tasty. the beer was right on.i definitely plan to return for brunch, and perhaps for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
this is hands down my village favorite. &nbsp;amazing kitchen, great deserts and pastries, full bar, friendly service, and cozy atmosphere! &nbsp; i absolutely love this place!! &nbsp;they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 7 days a week and the overall pricing of the regular menu is very fair. &nbsp;i hope the other atwater establishments take note at the service, food quality and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that bon vivant offers and takes their lead.  bon vivant is doing it right and it shows as they are always packed with the locals from open to close, 7 days a week.... there is a reason for this, come and give this place a shot, you wont be let down! &nbsp;fyi.. they also have live music on friday and saturday?! &nbsp;thank you bon vivant for listening to your locals and making this such a great establishment for all!
loved it. we had brunch &amp; didn't expect such huge portions (made for two meals). had the croque madame with home potatoes (no problem asking to substitute for the fries that come standard), a beautiful mixed greens salad &amp; hot chocolate. great pastries, too. cozy spot, pretty decor, and service was fine. we arrived at 1pm on sunday- there was no line to order &nbsp;&amp; got seats right away. the cheeses they had on display looked delish. i think <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> would be great there. we'll be back.
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is the shit!! can i say that on yelp? i'm not sure...we'll find out! they have drink specials and free appetizers on week days until 7. the chicken &amp; waffles are just as good as roscoes or maybe even better. sorry roscoes!! i'm here about once a week fir a hard cider and some people watching. the atmosphere is relaxing and very cute.
i love this spot! great ambiance, delicious food and treats, quality cocktails. they have live jazz music on saturday nights and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is hard to beat. for food i highly recommend their mac n cheese (with added butternut squash) or crab cakes. my favorite cocktail is, by far, the coco en fuego. as for treats, they have an amazing salted caramel chocolate chip cookie! i've never tried their cheese plates, but i hear the guy who coordinates that part of the bizz goes above and beyond. <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to call myself a bon vivant regular!
love this place... atmosphere is great, great food, good prices, full bar, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;they also are a great supporter of the neighborhood (they offer a 15% discount if u have a receipt from local merchants). i love to chill by the fire place at night when they open up the wall and sip some wine... so cozy!
this is my favorite restaurant in this area! my girlfriend and i came here with a living social voucher expecting to have mimosas and an easy breakfast. we were so impressed and pleased after our visit. i had my first run with eggs benedict. i had mine with the crab cakes whereas she went for the traditional canadian ham. both were satisfying! i liked it so much i forced my boyfriend to come back and give it try! he had the breakfast burrito packed with all the yummy fillings even mushrooms (my fave). i went for the chicken and waffles. i was not disappointed. i have not tried the dinner menu yet, but hope to make it back for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. love the neighborhood of atwater village and is a great place to go for an all day date.
my first time here and i was impressed. &nbsp;can't believe i have not try this place sooner. &nbsp;i grew up in atwater and i love everything about this little community. &nbsp;it's literally walking distance from my parents place.well my experience here was amazing. the service was great. the lady at the &quot;order here&quot; area was extremely knowledgeable and recommended her favorite items on the menu. so i went with her recommendations and ordered the kobe burger and crab cakes. omg! perfecto! thank you for recommending them. my taste buds applaud you! seriously! the crabs cakes were muy excellente and the kobe burger was cooked to perfection.the venue has that casual feel where you can lounge, relax, take your significant other or friends for &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!&quot; yup the magic word! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts from 4 to 7 monday thru friday. they even have free appetizers when you purchase alcohol. score! i think i might just need to get my drink on!overall, &nbsp;i am definitely coming back here to try other items on the menu and get chocolate waisted while enjoying the ambiance and the neighborhood.service was great. our food arrived promptly. &nbsp;its one of those places where you must pay before you get your food type of deal. &nbsp;i don't mind it at all especially when you're in a rush and don't feel like waiting for the waiter to hurry up and give the check so you can leave. none of that here. just leave a tip anytime and you can leave since the bill has been paid already.i just love how this place is situated. the decor is awesome. the front is exposed to the street. you can also bring your pet for all those dog lovers out there cuz they aso have outdoor seating. i would love to bring my english bulldog here one day.ohhhh and for all those sweet lovers out there. this place has it all. they have a variety of pastries from gluten free cakes to cookies to brownies. yummy! sounds amazing. &nbsp;i gotra try it all. i had an amazing experience with my significant other and we are definitely coming back! see ya soon!
i absolutely love bon vivant market &amp; cafe. the location itself is very spacious. the servers are very kind and polite.if you need a place to plug in and do some work for a few <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, their are plenty of outlets and comfy seating. they do a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> monday-friday from 4:00 pm -7:00 pm where the drinks are not only cheap, but they have an assortments of cheeses and small plates out for free. i almost didn't want to write a review because i do not want such a great place to get too overcrowded during the day time when i am trying to work, but they are so great and deserve it. when ordering food, the portions are pretty big and they have free refills on coffee.
what an awesome new place for my favorite neighborhood atwater village! &nbsp;i love the look and vibe and how open it is. having a new place for cocktails is a huge benefit and so different than my fav tee gee that it shouldn't hurt either biz. &nbsp;we had the burger with duck egg and fries along with the roasted tomatoes and portabello mushrooms. all were super tasty. those fries will be the death of me. &nbsp;my only concern is that it seems pricey for certain items and i don't see atwater as so chi chi. hopefully they will do a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or some sort of bargain offer. can't wait to go for cocktails.
unfortunately i have to agree with many of the posts here. and like so many others, i really want to like this place. and if people start out wanting to like a place..........it's usually up from there. &nbsp; it has so much potential. &nbsp;on my last visit, i was getting a pastry and latte to go. &nbsp;it took two people to make the latte. &nbsp;and it took a long time. &nbsp;my simple order seemed complicated. &nbsp;and the staff was not even remotely friendly. &nbsp;(i didn't even request any special milk or anything.) &nbsp;i work in the hospitality business and it's not rocket science. &nbsp;but on the same hand: &nbsp;it is so very important to get it right. &nbsp;maybe some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink and food specials will help while they get their act together. &nbsp;as there is nothing that i'd call a good value on the menu. &nbsp;but again, we all really want them to make this place a success.
good for lounging - not for foodiesim reviewing after my second second visit, but had a similar experience the first time - i just wanted to try this place again before i made up my mind.bon vivant's a relaxing atmosphere, resplendent with beautifully ornate dishes and decor. &nbsp;conversely i've found consistently slow and . . . inadequate service (they incorrectly over charged me on both occasions) and fattening but flavorless food. it seemed like an earnest attempt was made: i could taste the fat that went into my pot pie, my mac and cheese - wonderful texture and perfectly baked - but none of the flavor. no flavor at all. my wife and i both looked at each other confused. it was like when you're sick and can't taste anything - except we weren't.the char-grilled oysters were ok - excessively coated with parmesan cheese - more cheese than oyster.the charred kale salad was an effortless behemoth of raw kale leaves with burnt edges - not what i was expecting at all. after a couple of bites, we left it untouched.a big plus: the mixed drink i had, was, amazingly delicious - as in, ignoring the food and service, i'm coming back for that. the bartender was excellent.the yogurt with granola, berries and honey was very good - a lot of honey (read: a lot of honey).the two times we went: a sunday lunch and a thursday around 11:30am, much of the clientele seemed to be the long-term lounger - and this is a good place for that. laptops, stay at home moms, typing and chatting - no one seemingly touching their food or drink.i will come back i think: for hanging with a big cup of coffee or my drink at a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - just not for the grub.so 2 stars. one for the atmosphere, one for my drink. minuses to the food, service and overall experience.
i love this place! whenever i have a job in the area i try to stop by. first off, it's huge inside and the woodsy decor and airy space makes you want to stay here forever. and you kinda can, since there's a great bar and big comfy sofas to sit on as well as lots of table space. or you can sit outside on the patio with your pooch and enjoy the sunshine! (if you haven't been there, it's not waiter-table service--you go up the counter and order/pay and pick your fave spot to sit at, then they bring your food.)i'm a veg, but bon vivant has lots of nommy meatless stuff while also keeping my meatitarian friends swooning. that's not easy! i love the grilled cheese sammie here but i'm also obsessed with the crepes and bottomless mimosas for brunch. &nbsp;i have also come by here for a latte from the coffee bar and a big ol' slice of pie from the dessert case. all their desserts are made right there by friandise pastries so you just can't lose. &nbsp;they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but i'm a night owl so i love that they're open late too. i just can't get enough of &quot;the good life!&quot;
i want to like this place because it has great decor and is near where i live in silver lake. &nbsp;plus, i like supporting neighborhood businesses. &nbsp;i have only been here for dinner and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (where they offer free food). &nbsp;the choices for wine are better than decent. &nbsp;the food is less than decent. &nbsp;mediocre soup, passable greek salad, and dry bread. &nbsp;i should have sent it back, instead i took a couple of bites and left the rest in the basket (which i think was $3). &nbsp;the calamari on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu was the worst calamari i had ever eaten (the guy eating it next to me said the same thing without me bringing it up first). &nbsp;on a positive note, i've had a couple of delicious pastries and the service has improved in regards to bartenders. &nbsp;i'll stop by every few months for a glass or two of wine and a cookie since the atmosphere is great and it is convenient to home, but will skip the food unless there are changes in the kitchen.
the reviews about this place are really all over the place. &nbsp;being there myself about 4-5 times since they first opened last year, it really makes me think that the people who don't love this european concept may just not be ready for it. &nbsp;the place is located in the heart of the village and it has a very casual atmosphere in a totally european, chill way. &nbsp;everything i've tried so far has been delicious and my all time favorite is the chicken salad. yum. &nbsp;they have incredible cheese and meat boards as well as pastries to die for. &nbsp;on to the service part - yes, you have to order everything at the counter and they bring it out to you. &nbsp;that's how it is in a lot of european inspired places and i don't see how this is such a negative for so many people on here. &nbsp;you get fantastic service at the counter, you sit and enjoy tranquility without having a server hovering over. &nbsp;it's exactly what i personally enjoy. &nbsp;for people who need more attention, you can always sit at the bar. &nbsp;the bartenders are all very friendly, at least that has been my experience. &nbsp;go see michelle, she'll muddle up an amazing cocktail and even play some quirky and fun game with you!! the last time i went, they had started a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with complimentary appetizers from 4-7pm monday - friday. what?? amazing, that's all!!
the lady friend and i checked this place out because of a living social deal. i was expecting at least ok food, with maybe some interesting side or exotic dessert. great. googly. moogly. was i off. this place should be the jewel of the neighborhood. when i walked in, i liked everything about the place; the decor was awesome, welcoming. interesting design choices without cramming it down your thoat; we are a cool restaurant. restraint was present in the decor. music was (again, for my $) excellent choice and much more importantly (in the event it was -not- my bag), at a perfect level. i could hear my dinner companion at a normal voice, but not the other tables. the table advertisement claimed free (that means you don't pay for it) free appetizers during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. recognize fools. even the merchandising of the cheeses, desserts, and beers is well done. you can see everything. i know, i know, i'm not even to the food yet. i had the duck egg burger (not the exact name, but it'll get you there)...and i had to really resist the fat kid urge to order a second one. it was amazing. the special lady friend had the salmon, and it almost made me wish i'd ordered the healthy option..it was also delicious. the side of roasted brussel sprouts were good...too good. our host and i assume perhaps manager or owner admitted the secret was lots of butter. well done sir. that probably made me like this place more than anything. the gentleman that took our order gave more than a shit...he genuinely seemed to care about our dining experience, and that we were satisfied customers. go now. go often. this place is top shelf.
checked this place out today through a groupon deal. glad i used the voucher and didn't pay regular price for the food i ordered. &nbsp;usually don't like complaining about food especially at discounted price, but i gotta say i wasn't feeling it. don't get me wrong, the place has really nice interior design, staff is pleasant, they have a good selection of bottled beers and cheese plates and the free iced water is very refreshing, but some of their food is not worth what they charge. &nbsp; &nbsp;i ordered a grilled cheese and my friend had the mozzarella sandwhich...food that you can't go wrong with, but both turned out to be flops! i mean, 12 bucks is a bit pricey when all you get is boring cheddar/mozz between two slices of hard bread and unripened tomatoes. &nbsp;sorry, food needed way more kick to be worth that price! oh and the oily, soggy, undercooked side order of fries that took forever to receive where a whopping $8 dollars! that's way too much! the side salads on the other hand were simple, but good. &nbsp;i'm giving it 3 because the staff was sweet, place is cute and because in the end i didn't pay regular price. willing to try this place again, but will make sure to stick to their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink menu only.
if i was rating bon vivant on decor and pastries only it would be a solid 5, however those do not a full restaurant make.i've dropped by bon vivant on a friday evening for a light bite and glass of wine and it was a bit difficult to make that happen (you order at the either of the counters and they bring it out to you, but this isn't apparent when you first walk in, so you're left doing that awkward, &quot;what do we do here?&quot; dance). we ordered the brussels sprouts and two glasses of wine. the bartender was a bit frantic (and possibly newish) and therefore set a weird tone for the course of the evening. the glasses of wine were poured at a leisurely pace after being ordered (the brussels sprouts appeared first), which is neither here nor there, but when you're only popping in for a glass and a bite, having the glass in hand would be crucial to fulfill the night's agenda. the brussels sprouts were shaved and dusted with parmesean. i love me some brussels sprouts, sadly these were so bland and boring that they conjured up the days of childhood when you would run in the other direction at the mention of the b-word.while i wasn't eager to go back to bon vivant, someone suggested it for a breakfast meeting. i thought maybe this is where bon vivant will show me that i got it wrong the first time. i ordered a diy (design-it-yourself) omelet (with sausage, avocado, and goat cheese) and when it came out, it was a dry egg pita that housed a couple of slices of avocado, a dollpo of goat cheese, and a hefty portion of crumbled bfast sausage. because the ingredients weren't folded into the omelet, just plopped, there was no synergy with each bite. i had to open the thing up and move things around with my fork to create the perfect bite. unfortunately since the ratio of egg to avocado to goat cheese to sausage was askew, this was a difficult task. needless to say, not the most enjoyable experience.i am <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to gush over their pastries, specifically their cookies and unicorn gluten-free cake! the decor is something to marvel over, and i love how the front of the restaurant is exposed to the street through large openings. and, although i haven't ventured in yet for it, and am not deterred by my two not so exceptional experiences, they do have free hors d'oeuvres during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4pm-7pm, mon-fri)!
how lucky am i to live in atwater village and be walking distance from this fabulous place?! &nbsp;i don't even know where to start.....the food is absolutely fantastic and varied..i simply cannot get enough of the butter! ridiculous. cheese plate...macaroni...steak...salmon...i haven't had a thing that i haven't loved! &nbsp;and don't even get me started on the desserts....great variety, decadent and delicious. next....on to the bar....<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials are incredible....wine and beer selection is superb, plus creative cocktails to please anyone. behind the bar you get the friendliest, knowledgable bartenders...johnny, michelle, nadia and flora...they're all just fantastic. the vibe is awesome...open, airy, relaxed and comfortable. the music is always fantastic and when there's been a dj...he takes requests!! i couldn't love this place more and every single person (and there's been many) that i've brought here end up coming back on their own because they love it so much...even a friend from pasadena drives here for the duck sandwich!!!
i have been here several times and each time i love it a little bit more. &nbsp;first of all, it is such a great addition to the neighborhood! &nbsp;i love all the other local places too, but this definitely fills its own niche. &nbsp;first, i fell in love with the space. &nbsp;it's a huge open space with several different kinds of seating arrangements, open to the street and with a great big cozy fireplace. &nbsp;then, i fell in love with the food. &nbsp;being vegetarian, there are lots of things i can't try, but i don't ever feel left out. &nbsp;the mac and cheese is seriously the best i've ever had, and the veggie items in the deli case are fresh and delightfully varied. &nbsp;i've brought several items to various events (picnic, potluck) to rave reviews. &nbsp;coffee is great too! &nbsp;and, since they got their liquor license, i am also fond of coming here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and they have wonderful meat/cheese plate options to enjoy with your wine! &nbsp;my favorite thing to do for lunch is pick a few different things from the deli case to make my own little tapas collection. &nbsp;they will even arrange it all together on one place, warming what needs to be heated, and bring it to me. &nbsp;i'm always surprised when i do this at how truly reasonably priced it comes out to be! &nbsp;for example, a friend and i each had lovely specialty coffees (cappuccino/latte), three quesadilla triangles with sour cream and salsa, a quinoa patty with some kind of delicious chipotle pepper cream sauce, two veggie dolmas, and three little pastries stuffed with various meat/chicken salads (for my friend). &nbsp;it was all served beautifully on a big plate and it was less than $20, and that was before my kcrw 15% discount! &nbsp;we both had plenty to eat and got to enjoy the wonderful ambience of this friendly neighborhood place. &nbsp;highly recommend!
the-tam-o-shanter-los-angeles
grass fed tamburger. perfect and simple. great beers on tap. good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
throwback restaurant!part of the lawry's family. they do have more options then lawry's but they have the prime rib too. they do not wheel the carts around though.parking is valet, $3.50. takes reservations. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 7 pm.service is very slow, like most old school places. took along time to order, get food, and get the check. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks, $2 off draft and $1 off well drinks. - tam o'shanter whisky smash - $12 - sweet but you get some whisky flavor. - stone delicious ipa - $8  - belhaven scotch ale - $7 - foamybread - complementary. i liked the dark, wheat bread.tam cut - $39 - i asked for bone in. just as good as lawry's. comes with cream corn, but not as good. did not come with spinning salad. needs more au ju.fish &amp; chips - $17 - fish was perfectly fried and flaky. fries and slaw were basic.mac and cheese - $8 - very cheesy. one of the better mac and cheese's i have had at a steakhouse. souflee - $10 - light, fluffy, and gooey. and packed with chocolate!
i approve of the m-f 4-7 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;$4 for well drinks? yes, please! $3 off $7 bar bites? yes, please! we sat in the bar and was unsure if we had to order all of our drinks or food at the bar. &nbsp;luckily, the very nice bartender helped us out all evening.beware, the bar looks like it's bumping if you walk in during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but once the clock strikes 7, it's no man's land.the place is valet only, but there are plenty of metered street parking and residential parking you can take advantage of.
this place is pretty awesome. i came in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with some friends. i loved the $5 beers. we had the chili cheese fries. wait, i know that sounds lame but the chili is make from prime rib. yes, prime rib chili. we also had dessert. i had the toffee bread pudding and it was really good. i would definitely come back here. parking is valet but street parking was close and easy to find.
i have loved the tam o'shanter for years but had a very bad experience there last night that ruined my meal. &nbsp;it mostly had to do with a very bad server. &nbsp;we arrived around 6 pm and found a nice &quot;covered&quot; seat in the &quot;carving&quot; room since we were just going to go there for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink, sandwich and dessert. &nbsp;i had called earlier and was told that all well drinks were $4. &nbsp;i had been there before at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and had a bloody mary however this time the waitress said that that particular drink would be $11. not $4. &nbsp;she said we could get any other type of juice like cranberry, grapefruit, orange, etc but not bloody mary mix. &nbsp;i said, ok, then just give me plain tomato juice with my <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink. &nbsp;in an effort to be difficult, she replied, &quot;then you will have to pay $4. for the shot of vodka plus pay for some tomato juice making it close, again to the $11. price.&quot; &nbsp;i should have asked to speak with a manager since i don't see the difference between all of the other juices and tomato juice but i was visibly upset and ended up with no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink. &nbsp;she didn't seem to care at all.my friend and i had a corned beef sandwich and then ordered a souffle which was so crusty and grainey with sugar that we couldn't finish it. &nbsp;it was the worst souffle that i ever had anywhere. with the souffle i ordered a cup of coffee from the same waitress, and when it didn't come for a very long time, i had to ask a bus boy for it. &nbsp;she never came back to see if i wanted a refill, which i did, and i left being very disappointed with the entire experience, as did my friend.....mostly because of a completely incompetent and uncaring waitress.this has been one of my top 3 favorite restaurants for years but it will be awhile before i go back here.
the tam o' shanter is so weird. i really want to love this place with my whole heart, because it is a great restaurant. the food is always delicious, starting with the bread they bring to your table. mmm, so soft and wonderful. and i am so charmed by the decor, it puts me in a spell, and takes me to another world. just thinking about it now makes me want to head on over there, and it's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as i type this! have you experienced <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at the tam o' shanter? i did one day by chance and it was a delightful surprise, i recommend it ($4 well drinks, $10 fish and chips)... the problem i have with the tam is the service. the staff is usually very nice and accommodating, but not always, and that makes me uncomfortable. i've ordered things that were never brought out (i wasn't charged for it, so no big offense), and i saw a server get upset and point to my table (though i have no idea why), so i don't dine here as often as i would like to. however, based on the food alone, it is definitely 5 stars. enjoy!
appetizers: the scotch rarebit was amazing! the deviled eggs, because i am not a yellow mustard fan was not for me (overwhelming with yellow mustard), but the rest of the table seemed to enjoy them. my entr&eacute;e: toad in the hole, was delicious. also at the table was a couple of whiskey flights ordered. again they seemed to enjoy them. however my bottle of champagne was definitely more to my taste. emily was our server she was very attentive and pleasant. i will be back, next time <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> will be included at the tam o'shanter.
we know all there is to know about scottish culture, correct? let's check our list: scottish terriers, plaid kilts, haunted castles, mary queen of scots, and bag pipes. that's it, right? alright, so there is way more to know about scotland than the average american can attest to, but i have a great way to get started on your scottish study lesson: tam o' shanter in los feliz.owned by lowry's, tam o' shanter is a &nbsp;boarding pass to a scottish restaurant/bar without the hefty-costing airline ticket. architecturally, you will be swept into a the world of a scottish cottage with stained-glass windows, antique ovens, and a dining room which looks straight out of a king's eating hall. adding to the allure are the numerous tales of ghost hauntings and paranormal experiences (ask the employees about these). don't worry though, they only come out after-<span class="highlighted">hours</span>! ascestically, tan o' shanter is an ideal, unique dining experience.looking for a bit more of a scottish pub environment? the bar (featuring sports-broadcasting tvs) while still adding elements of class and scottish history; will fill your void. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 4-7pm and with such beers at local golden road hef on tap ($5 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price-- normally $7), your alcohol taste buds will be <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. although, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only involves standard drinks like beer and simple cocktails like vodka/cranberry so don't expect an extensive <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink menu (appetizers are $3 off). one of the exciting elements at tam o' shanter are the carolers whom stride through the restaurant during 4-9pm in the month of december. dressed in dickens-esque costume, you can't possibly not get into the christmas spirit. they personally go to specific tables and perform a personal concert. singing &quot;o holy night&quot; for my boyfriend and i, they certainly brought us warm cheer.employees at tam's are at the top of their game. polite, quick, and always in a relaxed mood (despite the chaotic restaurant); you shouldn't have much of an issue with service. the manager even remembered us from the yelp event held here which was very impressive.so whether you want a taste of scotland or merely an experience which differs from the usual la offerings, head to tam o' shanter. it is something worth seeing.
this was walt disney's favorite restaurant, and it has been around since the road was dirt, and it was considered out in the country. it was family owned for decades, then owned by the van de kamps, and now owned by lawrey's. there is a little historic display in the lobby to explain.but whereas lawrey's is an english prime rib place, tam o'shanter's is a scottish restaurant. the walls are covered with scottish coats of arms (very fun to look up your scottish family name if you have one and see your crest), and there are special scottish nights like robbie burn's birthday on january 25th each year, where they sing songs, do dances, and serve haggis. reservations must be made for this at least a month in advance.the main dish to get here is prime rib. the only downside is that they carve it in the kitchen (the actual lawrey's restaurants have old fashioned carts, which i think is much better). but that aside, the prime rib is excellent. there is also a bar that has an eating area that serves inexpensive prime rib sandwiches for lunch.as far as sides go i love the creamed spinach, but the creamed corn is also amazing. get both. tam's has a good selection of scotches and ales, and also a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but only for drinks (no food on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>).this is a favorite place of mine.
i generally do not eat meat, but my fellas wanted to check it out after a neighborhood <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i have to say that the best part besides the prime rib they had, ( i opted for the wee salad and yorkshire pudding...) was greg, the bartender....! a great ambassador to the brand, he was full of information and an overall delight. we will defiantly be back on monday as much as possible.
stopped in for a brew and a bite last night. had a harp ale and prime rib sammy. the bar has a great feel like somewhere not in la but not sure where. the pr sandwich on a roll was just ok. &nbsp;me thinks i will try the pastrami or turkey next time. oh yes there will be a next time. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4-7 is a bargain. &nbsp;if they had a pool table or dart board i would be in heaven.
i've recently discovered atwater village and cannot get enough! &nbsp;i stumbled upon the tam o'shanter and have never been happier! &nbsp;it's a fantastic place - filled with memorabilia and the most incredible vibe. &nbsp;if only those walls could talk. &nbsp;the staff there is extremely knowledgeable and told wonderful stories. &nbsp;the food was delicious and hearty and the drinks were authentic and served to perfection. &nbsp;most importantly, though, was the feel of the place. &nbsp;they are true to their historic roots but bring in trendy and fun events too. &nbsp;for instance - if you update your status and tag them tonight (nye) after 8pm you get <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices all night long!i also heard a rumor they invented valet parking. &nbsp; genius.
had a crazy prime rib craving but didn't want to drive all the way out to beverly hills to go to lawrys. decided to yelp around and came across this little gem. got there a little before our reservation time and was seated right away. was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to see lawrys prime rib on the menu and ordered mine medium. food came out super fast and was just as tasty as the real deal, but much much closer. looks like they have a weekday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4-7. will definitely be back to try the toad in a hole. was out of there by 7. fastest, most satisfying sit down dinner to date!
my review 3.5 stars. &nbsp;i will say that this review is based on only one visit during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i only had the pork sliders, which were decent. but the great thing is that they have a great selection of beer there. they have all of my favorites, triple karmeliet, russian river- damnation, and many, many more.the service was decent (even for a group of 12) and the place had an interesting ambiance. &nbsp;i may make another visit, if friends insist, but i don't know if i would make the trip on my own. i definitely do need to make another visit, just to be fair.
this is one of my favorite restaurants. it is one of the oldest restaurants in los angeles with an interesting history. &nbsp;it is so la with a scottish theme. the food is consistently delicious. &nbsp;i don't always go for the prime rib with yorkshire pudding since their other menu items are equally well-prepared. i often begin my meal with a well concocted manhattan cocktail (they have a separate scotch-whiskey listing) and always enjoy the house chardonnay--it is buttery and oakey to perfection. &nbsp;tam has a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and often features talented groups performing lively, foot-stomping celtic music. &nbsp;there is a bar carving station serving lighter and cheaper fare to go with your ale.this is mostly a special occasion restaurant for us, but will come back to eat at the bar for their cheap prime rib sandwiches!
minus 1 star for the not free parking valet even though the lot is easy &amp; spacious (like a target parking lot)&amp; even though the prime rib was not as fantastic as i wanted it to be, i'll still leave 4 stars.mine was not hot temperature (&amp; im the type to toss in an ice cube in my soup/coffee ok)im sure the bread butter was not 100% butter also.but the glenlivet cocktail w/honey &amp; lemon was super super good &amp; i cant wait to have that again.the lobster tail was puny &amp; coated in like panko/oregano flakes .the french onion soup was great the portions were fine.the prices not too high (my bday dindin so i dont know the check total)the choc soufflee was wonderful &amp; yes fresh as a daisy.spacious dining room feel &amp; a great vibe for casual &amp; dress up.professional service.will return, but maybe for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> area/ menu
i love this place!!! &nbsp;this has been one of my go-to &quot;special&quot; occasion restaurants for the last 15+ years. &nbsp;the lawry's family, owner of the fancy bev. hills prime rib place owns this restaurant as well. &nbsp;i believe it was their very first one. &nbsp;the prime rib menu here is identical to the one in bev. hills. &nbsp;the cool thing about their dinner menu is that it constantly changes with the seasons. &nbsp;i highly recommend a souffl&eacute; for dessert.if you want a quick lunch and drink, i highly recommend the sandwich bar for lunch or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.prices are a bit pricey but this place is a first class restaurant. &nbsp;service is first class. &nbsp;portions could be a bit bigger but fair compared to other restaurants in this price range. &nbsp;valet parking $3 (i think).
a classy establishment. if you have an affection for the uk and pub/tavern like places and the constant sunny southern cali weather is driving you crazy then i recommend you head on over to this restaurant and bar right away. dark inside. lots of little rooms. i met a lady here who had been coming back to the tam every year for 35 years around the holidays. she says it's a magical, festive place around christmas, and if you're going to come here you should definitely go then. a special occasion. i could see hanging out at this bar. especially if you like beer. the brisket sandwich was delicious, savory and full of flavor, the meat tender. friendly staff too. everyone was smiling and pleasant. note: this place has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> monday-friday 4-7pm. there's a parking lot, but it's valet and i'd recommend finding street parking. this area isn't too bad. you can do it. and it's way cheaper. do it. go here. now. (10:35 am? too early? oh, yeah. they open at 11am i believe - is this correct? you have time.)
i like tam's. &nbsp;it's a pretty good place. &nbsp;go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4 - 7) and beers are only $5/pint. &nbsp;they serve guinness and belhaven scottish ale. &nbsp;if you get there before 5, you can get the lunch menu. &nbsp;if you order a sandwich such as roast beef, brisket or corned beef, they have a chef come to the carving station and cut the meat right there in front of you. &nbsp;i've been here a few times. &nbsp;when it's crowded, it's loud. &nbsp;last time i was here was before 5, and the place was near empty, and quiet. &nbsp;the few folks that were there were decidedly older and more mellow. &nbsp;i struck up a conversation with a few of them, and found that one of them was from my old neighborhood where i'm from - only he was 20 years or so older than i. &nbsp;the meat sandwiches are good. the fish &amp; chips is also fantastic. &nbsp;they also serve the same hand made potato chips that they have at lawry's. &nbsp;i would definitely recommend this place, have been back a number of times, and will continue to go back.
damn, i should have gotten tom's chocolate souffle. so we rolled into this place for my friend's birthday dinner. let's go through my first impressions: right off the freeway, parking lot, cheap valet, or residential parking, plenty of waiting space, bar, live music, older folks. tom, you pass. you seem like the place i'd want to be a regular at if i lived nearer. as a party of almost 20, we got our own room. we're fancy! we started off with drinks and bread and the prompt service. i like that the menu is only two pages. i'm all for minimalism these days. they do meat, and meat's what you'll get. i split a california cut with two lobster tails, which came with sides of mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach, and added mac &amp; cheese and the french onion soup. i love love love being able to try so many different items! i have to say everything tasted perfectly. what's this ale and sandwich bar i hear? and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>? i must return!i think what made the night even more perfect was that i was among splendid company. what a great birthday dinner spot that allowed me to try this place out!
i agree with david, this is one of those spots you just can't help but appreciate. i went with 3 girlfriends for brunch. hangover helper anyone? yes please! how can you not like a place where the waitresses have to wear true scottish garb (plaid hat, little vest and white tights even!) and can still be totally fun and friendly and most importantly...keep the champagne flowwwwwing! i've been to a lotlotlotlotlot of brunches over &nbsp;years and i have to say this one was a real o'gem. ok, don't come if you want something healthy (although they do serve a nice salad with your meal) because it's all about &nbsp; the eggs benedict (4 kinds!) and prime rib here- i mean it is a lawry's, so get over it. i don't eat red meat very often but i had the tournados benedict and it was damn good.as one girlfriend put it &quot;...it's kind of like a little hobbit den&quot; and there were quite a few of the over 50 crowd, but the reasonable prices, friendly staff, and flowing champagne gave this place a place high on my list.i want to try the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> since some of my la crew say it rocks.oh, ps, while the valet is reasonable at $2, just park on the street.
tam o'shanter is the friendly, approachable cousin to the lawry chain of prime beef restaurants (the family member one likes best). &nbsp;tucked in the corner of los feliz since the 20's, tam is a cross between disney and scottish kitsch and is a highland castle sized space that remains intimate, friendly and authentic.i've been coming here for years and never tire of the charm of its tudor rooms lined with tartan plaids, prints of highland scenes, and ambient fireplaces. the attentive wait-staff is appropriately garbed in themed-attire. &nbsp;the food is consistently delicious. &nbsp;i don't always go for the prime rib with yorkshire pudding since their other menu items are equally well-prepared. i often begin my meal with a well concocted manhattan cocktail (they have a separate scotch-whiskey listing) and always enjoy the house chardonnay--it is buttery and oakey to perfection. &nbsp;tam has a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and often features talented groups performing lively, foot-stomping celtic music. &nbsp;there is a bar carving station serving lighter and cheaper fare to go with your ale.check out tam o'shanter for any family celebration, romantic evening, or satisfying evening out eating well!
so i've lived in the silverlake/los feliz/glendale area for nearly my entire life and somehow missed one of the most special, unique gems of the neighborhood because i don't like prime rib. i suppose i figured it was an overpriced and geriatric-laden-crotchety-old-man place. this past holiday season, a friend suggested we all met up at the ale &amp; sandwich bar after work. i was hungry and wanted a beer so we joined. omg! it is soooooooo cute inside! it was a few weeks before christmas and the whole place was decked out. fireplace going, carolers walking around taking requests, those tiny little alcoves with the wingback chairs and pedestal tables. i was in love. and then i got a hand-carved brisket sandwich on a brioche bun and it was total and utter heaven. they have a little carving station and a sides station with awesome potato salad. i don't really like their coleslaw a whole lot though. i would recommend the tam for a cold, rainy evening, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> any day, or for whenever you want to rip into a super-moist, meatstravaganza of a sandwich.
i have seen this place while on route to the los feliz costco, and have been wanting to try it. &nbsp;well, a date night with hubby provided the perfect opportunity! &nbsp;as has been said in other reviews, tam o'shanter is brought to you by the lawry's prime rib folks, but has a much more laid-back vibe and a better menu. &nbsp;i thoroughly enjoyed my toad in the hole, which is yummy filet mignon stew; but couldn't even do it justice for having gorged in the scotch rarebit (fondue). &nbsp;the drinks are very well-done as well, and service is absolutely impeccable. &nbsp;our waitress, melinda, was so attentive and helpful with suggestions; the gentleman bussing our table was on his game and so so polite. &nbsp;in addition, the manager on duty came by our table to make sure that everything was to our liking. &nbsp;as we were leaving, we noticed a band playing live music; so i can totally see coming here for a laid-back <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;for those who are la history buffs like me, walt disney, john wayne, and mary pickford used to frequent this place. &nbsp;you can see the influence of it today at disneyland. &nbsp;i am so very glad that hubby and i had a chance to share this most special dining opportunity.
having lived in the los feliz area almost my entire life, i have surprisingly never set afoot in this joint. we always went to lawry's on la cienega but never thought about tam o'shanter which is only five minutes away; both are under the same company. when dinela came around, the fellas and i decided to give it a shot. a reservation is highly recommended especially if you have a party of 12 like we did.sharon, our lovely waitress was on point. our table can be somewhat of a rough crowd but she handled the situation flawlessly. using the dinela as an excuse to get together and eat here didn't go too far. out of the twelve guys, only two ordered off that set menu. the rest came of us came to the conclusion that the 6 oz prime rib cut and small lobster tail from that prefix deal wasn't going to cut it.many of the items in the menu are very similar to what you would see in lawry's menu. the californian cut, the english cut, instead of the lawry's cut you have the prince charlie cut, of course the infamous lawry's signature creamed corn and spinach (there's chopped bacon in it!) is available. the difference is that tam offers a lot more variety than its counterpart. everything from soups, salads, to different appetizers, steak, and an array of seafood options. also, don't expect the medallion bling bling'd out chef to come out and carve your meat in the carnivore wagon like at lawry's.we started with the golden fried calamari ($12) which i thought was pretty good but for that price, they could've given us more. i barely had two pieces and the rest was conquered in a second by my buddies. we also had the mac &amp; cheese ($7), another simple side dish that's on the pricier scale probably due to the fact that they used smoked gouda and wisconsin cheddar. it was thick yet still runny, but nothing super special.i settled with the tam o'shanter cut ($31), medium, which i came to the conclusion that i should have went with medium rare instead. don't be afraid to ask for extra au jus sauce because the meat soaks it all up in the plate. instead of the mash and gravy, i asked for creamed corn and spinach which are pretty much a guaranteed hit. if you like the prime rib at lawry's, then you will have no issues having it here because i wasn't able to tell if there was a difference between the two. the yorkshire pudding is different though; it has a little more volume and is a bit harder. that extra au jus will help soften it up.tam o'shanter is like a toned down version of lawry's. maybe not as fancy, but the food is of the same caliber. the price might be slightly cheaper and there are more options on the menu. the whole environment is more relaxed but i still wouldn't show up in shorts, sandals, and a grungy tee. got to love the whole scottish theme as well as the staff's classic uniforms.when you first enter the establishment, there's a bar on the left which you can also find a sandwich bar next to it. think of higher end bar food, sandwiches and what not. i believe there's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and they did have sunday night football on the flat screens.and to reiterate on the service because it was impeccable. our waters never ran dry including some of the ice teas on the table. because it was our first time dining there (we did celebrate two late bdays as well), sharon gave us complimentary english trifle to share. kudos to the staff especially to her. my pal nat y. would like to personally commend the hostess chloe for not only being nice but helping us snap a group pic.by the end of the meal, we were all stuffed and very satisfied. i know now that i don't need to travel all the way to beverly hills for some tasty prime rib or for some of that tasty creamed corn. tam o'shanter deserves more recognition than just being a distant cousin of lawry's. don't forget, you can also use your lawry's vip membership here to rack up points!valet parking is available but there was plenty of free street parking if you want to save some cash.
the bf and i were actually on our way to little tokyo but traffic was insane! we had been battling traffic for close to an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>, our starting point was burbank and we only made it atwater village by way of side streets in that time. my stomach and temper were desperately shouting at me and the bf was on pins and needles... he knows how i get... lol.anyway, i recently went to tam o'shanter for the first time during a yelp elite event and remembered how impressed i was. it was my duty as navigator to call it quits on our initial destination and settle on tam o'shanter as our next stop - the bf happily agreed.the place was pretty busy, no surprise as a lot of patrons were getting together for the holidays and it was a friday night! luckily we snagged a booth in the bar, score!carlisle was our server and provided excellent service. he did forget to bring out a side of gravy but it's okay, poor guy was slammed and we could tell he was doing his best.we ordered:french onion soup, big enough to share between 2 people. it had a lot of flavor and was served at a nice hot temperature.tam o'shanter cut med-rare, we shared this between the two of us and each got a lobster tail. it was more than enough food!! i got mine with cream corn and spinach while the bf got cream corn and mashed potatoes. next time, i'll skip the spinach and get double corn or a side of potatoes. the yorkshire pudding was good too, especially when you sop it up with gravy!!we ended our meal with an order of chocolate souffle. good god, this thing was massive!! it came with a side of cream and it was really rich.. we were only able to take a few bites before raising the white flag.it's definitely a place to indulge while feeling comfortable and cozy, you could probably fall asleep for a few minutes before realizing it! the decor and ambiance of the place is really amazing, a nice cherry on top for the history buffs as well as they have a lot of memorabilia of the establishment circa 1920's i believe. i know the bf took a good ten minutes to peruse all the articles and photos.i'm <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to have discovered tam o'shanter after so many years of seeing it and wondering about it. i especially like the fact that i can come here rather than make the drive down to beverly hills. to be honest, i prefer this venue itself over lawry's.... there's just something nostalgic about it that gives you that warm fuzzy feeling. great spot, especially during the holidays!

great place to enjoy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, mingle with friends, and watch the nba finals on their 50&quot; flat screen.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks - ranges from $4 - $7carne asada tots - $7 - must have!hot italian sausage - $5 - hot italian links inside banh mi bread. super delicious!overall satisfied and will come back again for other food and drinks!
just got a few <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items. we got the deviled eggs, the brussel sprouts, and the chicken wings. my favorite were the eggs... sadly there were only 2 per order. the chicken wings were interesting, a good balance of flavors. they smelled a bit like chocolate to me... but maybe i'm just crazy. the brussel sprouts were a little too sweet for me. i'd go back and try more stuff.
this place ranks #1 in a few things, such as:-sake bombs that during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are $3! all while they're poured into the cutest disposable sake cups i've ever seen. -burgers/sliders, no joke... not only are these craft bites absolutely divine in taste, they're affordable! &amp; gigantic. -casual atmosphere that's never too stuffy and as far as i've experienced has never been excessively crowded. bar service is a bit... &quot;distracted &amp; unfocused,&quot; so that can take some effort.
i'm always skeptical of &quot;asian fusion&quot; places, and hate when anyone marks up prices of banh mi. i was proven totally wrong at black sheep, where the banh mi sliders were actually phenomenal, with delicious nem nuong-like patties. my friends' burgers were equally good: juicy patties and massive servings. the tator tots were the only average food item we got. they have some beer on tap, and cheap wine and sake if you want a drink with your meal. if they had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i lived around there, i would not be able to stay away from those sliders.
this place is a great hole in the wall spot located in downtown la. my friend and i stopped in because of their burger and tots! there were many people there around <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> time, so come in quick and grab a spot!black sheep burger: the burger was super juicy! it was well seasoned and the soft bun was perfect. what makes this burger amazing is not just the bacon on top, but the garlic aioli that's slathered on the buns. this was a very good burger.carne asada tots: these tots came loaded with carne asada, pico de gallo, and crema. the flavors were all great, however the tots underneath for pretty soggy pretty quick. i actually preferred the regular crispy tots.
valar morghulis means all men must die in high valyrian. but you can't die until you checked this place out! this is a small gastropub next to cole's and the association (another pub you need to check out). they make these amazing decadent burgers, similar to what you will get at umami burger. i was going to get the black sheep burger, but opted to get the royale with cheese instead because it comes with a fried egg! after the first bite, you definitely can tell they use quality ingredients. the bun is nice and soft and the burger was cooked a perfect medium rare.the best part of the entire meal for me was the beer! this is the first place i have ever been to that served valar morghulis, a beer made for game of thrones! i have been looking for this beer everywhere but they are always sold out. so glad i was able to try it here!i can't give this a perfect 5 star because:1. they open later than most bars (6pm) so i can't come immediately after work. 2. no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.3. the service was pretty slow, but i can't blame the waitress. it appeared that she was waiting on the entire restaurant. even though this place is pretty small, they definitely need more than one waitress on a friday night.
don't let the nondescript entrance deter you from giving black sheep a shot. the entrance is overshadowed by cole's next door, but once you find your way inside you'll be greeted by dark, clean-cut, simple modern furniture, a well-balanced selection of booth and stool seats and an efficient bar/ordering counter along a couple large tv's. black sheep aims for a slightly elevated bar scene with a bit more suaveness and hits the mark pretty well. it's reminiscent of less rambunctious doghaus with a little more craft beer, and i find that i enjoy both equally well. the food is straightforward and delicious. they have a variety of burgers and the black sheep burger with gouda and caramelized onions was savory, delicious and just the right amount of messy. at $7 it's the size of a umami burger but not close to the cost. parmesan fries were okay, not the worst and not the best but the carne asada tots were fantastic. i'd order that again in a heartbeat. finally...good selection of beers, with a good range of darker ales/stouts, ipa's and pales. black sheep is up there on my list of casual places to hang out for post-work <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> in downtown.
meh. picked this place to meet up with a friend in dt largely based on the yelp reviews. was expecting something better but i found the place to be just okay. with such a variety of places to meet up in dt, i probably wouldn't come here again. they have burgers and beer, but then lots of places do...along with more seating and lights (hey black sheep...did you know some people like to chat with the lights on?). this place is too cute to be a dive bar and not lively enough to be a gastropub. for a thursday at 7 it was a little on the dead side, although it did get packed up around 9:30ish. here are a few other details that will help you decide whether or not this confused little place is worth a visit:details:1) burgers and sausage dogs. one of those places you order at the bar and then they bring it to you. i ordered the patty melt but they didn't have bread (wtf?) so i got a burger the bartender suggested instead. when it came, the burger was cold and the bun was so shiny with oil that i could practically see my reflection. shared the carne asada tots with a pal and thought the meat looked too gray for my liking.2) beer - on tap. not that much of a variety...$6-8. sake bombs, $3. wine. no mixed drinks.3) bartenders - cutesy college girls none too helpful.4) dark steak house lighting - not ideal to meet up with a friend. &nbsp;5) near los angeles street. be advised if you sit at one of the outside tables in front of the place, you may get pestered by vagrants walking over from that area. 6) no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu that i noticed. if you decide to bypass the black sheep you aren't missing much. it wasn't that memorable of a place for me to want to go back to. it's right next door to cole's so you can always pop over there if you're disappointed. parking: if you don't get a meter, there's a $5 valet parking structure on spring and 5th that's open 24 <span class="highlighted">hours</span>.
great local bar/restaurant in downtown that's very reasonably priced with plenty of food options! if you're unfamilar with the area, it's actually hard to see from the street because it's somewhat &quot;underground&quot; and below street level. &nbsp;just look for cole's sandwich shop that's next door as well as the association. &nbsp;inside, black sheep has a modern and chic decor, has an moderate amount of seating (25-30approx?), and a very large led tv that plays espn.in terms of the good, the black sheep has many things going for it. &nbsp;expansive menu with around 10 burger options and a few other sandwich options, all of which are very reasonably priced and $8-9 (for la standards, and for &quot;gourmet&quot; burgers). &nbsp;i'm actually surprised that the black sheep hasn't followed the despicable trend like other burger places to charge $12-15-20 for burgers (without any sides of course) like umami and any other non-fast-food burger place. &nbsp;their appetizer list is also quite diverse and all of them seem fairly priced and are definitely sharable between 2 people. &nbsp;of the two burgers i tried, the black sheep burger was definitely more flavorful and left a more memorable experience than the steakhouse burger (which had a weaker cheese and also just non-flavorful sauteed mushrooms). &nbsp;what i liked about the burgers at the black sheet is that the buns aren't oily or too thick and dry; the consistency &amp; taste is similar to a king hawaiian sweet bread roll. &nbsp;the patties were both very thick (at least 1.5&quot;) and the ratio of bun:meat:toppings was 1:2:1, probably optimal! &nbsp;overall, my burger filled me up, but i wasn't struggling to stuff the last few bites as i am with some of the excessively-larger burgers out there. &nbsp;the appetizer that i tried were the parmesan garlic fries ($4) which i thought were &quot;okay.&quot; &nbsp;the main issue i had was that the melted slices of swiss cheese were a bit cold and solidified and thus when i tried to get cheese and fries, i could only get fry and no cheese. the fries themselves were not very hot either, and a few minutes into eating them, they were completely cold :( &nbsp;i couldn't taste very much garlic either, but i'm a huge fan of garlic flavors and don't really think there's such thing as &quot;too much&quot; garlic. &nbsp;their drinks are super cheap and the same as the pricing during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at most places; glass of house wine was $4 as was beer. &nbsp;you can get imported bottled beers for $5-6. &nbsp;but $4 for a decent tasting merlot is great value!! &nbsp;i wonder if they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials....if they did, i would come back to black sheep tonight lol.lastly, my biggest complaint about the black sheet is that it's so understaffed. &nbsp;the poor asian girl visually looked drained and was probably physically exhausted from working there all by herself in the front. &nbsp;she took orders, brought the food to the tables, and even cleaned up after customers all by herself. &nbsp;i wouldn't be too surprised if she helped out in the kitchen too! &nbsp;i don't even know if she's getting her breaks/meals considering there was no one else in sight. &nbsp;lucky for us, it wasn't a busy sunday night , but i can see how if it got busy, things could get ugly. &nbsp;overall, i would definitely go back to the black sheet and try out a few of the other delicious-sounding burgers and side dishes. &nbsp;i just hope that i don't see that poor overworked asian girl by herself during busy time, or i'll have to file a complaint on her behalf to the labor department :p
this bar is as asian as i am. &nbsp;frankly, i don't get it's category or qualifier. &nbsp;they do have 1 or 2 items on the menu that are &quot;asian-inspired&quot; and have sake, but other than that, it's an all-american gastro no different. &nbsp;and, it's really a 4.5 star place to boot.it's dark and small. &nbsp;when i say dark, i should say painted black. &nbsp;it's sparse in decor, which is why black sheep doesn't get a 5 star (along with it's gritty location). &nbsp;with that said, the whole tone of the experience is chill -- both in service and music -- that somehow out of this darkness is light (or is that the glow from the tv's?).amy, the bartender, really helps sets the tone. &nbsp;i don't know how this place rocks without her, but she's really cute and talkative, and was the only person on the staff interfacing with customers. &nbsp;i'd rate her a solid a, and her tats an a+. &nbsp;with a great amount of knowledge, she's able to suggest their ever-changing drafts, sake, and food choices.the main takeaway for me is that i came here, tried a number of items, and want more.speaking of the options...there's lots to like---------------------------------------------------i tried 4 or 5 beers...little samples...because most of what they carry are crafts....and i hadn't heard of them before. &nbsp;in summary, they carry a nice range of flavors -- and i several that were delicious. &nbsp;i was celebrating my bday, so a good friend was buying. &nbsp;yay! &nbsp;drafts vary from $5-7.they have a dozen sake choices. &nbsp;this will have to be part of my next trip to black sheep. &nbsp;unfiltered -- check!food. &nbsp;isn't it always the bottom-line to success?----------------------------------------------------------well, black sheep does it well. &nbsp;burgers, sides, and salads. &nbsp;my buddy and i shared:1 &amp; 2. &nbsp;carne asada tots (4.5 stars), and the parm fries (4.0 stars) -- both were excellent and large portions to share. &nbsp;there were several others, all sounded good. &nbsp;recommend. both.3. &nbsp;the black sheep burger ($8, 4.5 stars): garlic aioli, mushrooms, caramelized onions, gouda cheese, arugula. &nbsp;quality house-blended meat, good brioche bun. &nbsp;the black sheep burgers house blended beef patty, &nbsp;worthy. &nbsp;excellent burger. &nbsp;recommend on quality, flavor, and price. &nbsp;doesn't berger know? &nbsp;see my list.note: didn't try the banh mi sliders - but that's on my list.conclusion--------------small bar, not too busy during the week, good and casual hang with very fair prices that doesn't kill. &nbsp;perhaps on a sat night -- the feel changes. &nbsp;small bar, some tables, and some booths. &nbsp;i really like it as a place to chat, watch a game (no sound), and have quality food at a very fair price.black sheep is no bs -- it's worthy.tips------1. &nbsp;location is next to a couple of known old-time eateries (ie. coles), but also 1 block away from skid row. &nbsp;you can see it from the front door. &nbsp;i parked around the corner for free (after 6pm, meter zone). &nbsp;be careful and aware.2. &nbsp;this not a come early for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> bar kind of place. &nbsp;they open at 6pm most nights. &nbsp;be aware of the <span class="highlighted">hours</span>.
public-school-213-los-angeles
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is amazing. good drinks and rotating beer menu. those truffle fries are amazing. my favorite <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> location in dtla.
came in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was not disappointed. the bacon cheddar tots are a perfect appetizer. got the huntsman burger w/bacon...juicy, savory and great ingredients. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> has a $5 old fashion that is to die for. cant wait to come back.
enjoyed &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; very much. &nbsp;great drinks &amp; food. &nbsp;i will definitely come here again.
so glad this place has opened again. we came in friday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i lovedddd the new <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. the drink specials are awesome and the food specials will rock your socks without chomping at your wallet. be sure to try out the frito pie and the buffalo cauliflower - yummy!!!
good stuff! great staff and the food was fantastic. i was there w/ my kids for lunch on a saturday, but by looks of things, this would be the place to be for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during the week.
they have a pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. nice place to go with coworkers after the workday downtown. retro/hipsterish vibes, very unique atmosphere.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the only time i have been, but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices were reasonable, the selection of beers were pretty good. the food was really delicious, but the portions for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are reaallly tiny bite sized dishes, and i expected much more for the amount you pay for food, three bite sized burgers or tacos for almost $10 seemed a bit steep. honestly, i left drunk and hungry. so, in all, somewhat satisfying.
i love this place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the mac and cheese is yummy! i don't remember what time <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts but it ends at 7. i think if it went for one more <span class="highlighted">hour</span> it would be perfect. they have really good service and the waiters are friendly but the hostess didn't really like that we asked to be seated closer to the bar. prices are reasonable and it has a good vibe. perfect place for a date of just fun with friends and co workers.
they have a pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with drinks running about $4 or $5 for unique draft beers and well drinks. nice place to go with coworkers after the workday downtown. school ambiance and math wallpaper restrooms equal a great time in downtown la.  the food was really delicious, but the portions for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> are really tiny bite sized dishes. 3 &nbsp;bite sized burgers or adobo tacos for almost $10 seemed a bit steep.the draft beers- school ipa and white ale were clean, crisp, and refreshing. &nbsp;the crispy cauliflower were the most memorable snacks of the night. the bison burger was clean tasting and of high quality meat. can't wait to go back to school
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks are well priced :)i like the theme, the menu follows the theme and there are board games for customers. you really feel like you are in school... with alcohol.the food was great as gastropubs come. love bar food, esp those bag of fries!!!i think what separates this place and the 4 stars is the environment and customer service. it is rowdy but not to the point where you can't hear across the table. the waiters are really friendly! i guess it's the playful mood that puts smiles on our faces.
i love public school!! definitely a regular. a great bar in dtla! their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great! they have good brews and mixed drinks. the ambiance is a great balance. can get pretty packed but usually in the afternoon it's not too heavy. good music and yummy food!!! they have bar games and a lot of seating areas. it's in a great location!! super close to other hot spots in dtla. a lot of locals come here and the staff are always great!!
ambience is great for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.come here to get your downtown grubbing oni personally prefer the culver city location in terms of food taste and serviceit took about 25-30 minutes to get our foodwe sat on the shared tables had some interesting people sitting next to us. made for great dinner conversation. i liked our server i think they may have been short staffed on the day we went so probably not the best day.it was dark indoors, and i like light... natural light.i will go back just to compare and see what i really think about it
public school has been a part of my life since i moved to dtla four years ago. even though they no longer do the awesome sunday all-day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, public school 213 will not disappoint. the place is one of the best for after work drinks or meeting a group of friends. ahi tacos are my favorite, but everything on the menu is good. i love that you no longer have to order at the counter!!
i miss composition notebooks.i miss college-ruled paper.i miss underage drinking.wait, no. i mean, i miss...uh...drinking iced tea! yeah...well, i just miss school. and instead of sh*tty cafeteria food and crappy dive-bar drinks, you get awesome chorizo mac &amp; cheese and guavalajara. there's also a handsome list of beers on tap.so what's not to like?-------------------------now accepting applications to hang out with shelley z. at one of the best recess (<span class="highlighted">happy) hours</span> in dtla.
a great spot for a decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, rotating beer selection and laid back atmosphere. i've tried a few things off the hh menu and most of it was pretty good but i thought the deviled eggs were way overpriced for two pieces... which is basically one egg lol. but the burgers were on point. i tried the lamb and the huntsman. the meats were juicy, well seasoned and all around had great flavors. they also come with your choice of a side. the kale slaw is a must. the fries were a bit soggy but i liked the ketchup they provide. i also really enjoyed the &quot;school house&quot; theme they have going. super cute.
this place was pretty awesome, came here as a part of a social for a job interview and the ambiance was pretty chill. dress up, dress down, it's all good. the appetizers are pretty delicious and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu (recess) is pretty varied. i absolutely loved the ellie's brown ale (i don't even know where this actually lands on the beer snob list, but i definitely enjoyed mine and coming from a city (houston) where saint arnold's is pretty much the only thing on the menu, it was a nice change of menu scenery. would definitely come back next time i'm in downtown la.
i was a regular here for three years before the remodel, the staff was amazing, the food was awesome personal favorites the ahi tuna tacos and the tellagio pizza.came back after it reopened and was more then a little devastated. &nbsp;the entire staff that treated me and my coworkers like family for three years were all gone. &nbsp;some key food items got a major downgrade from what they were, just became copycats of ps in culver (ahi tacos and tellagio pizza specifically).our friday evening there, service left much to be desired, lack of focus, hospitality, connection with all layers of the staff we interacted with. &nbsp;we waited over 30 minutes for our order to be taken, 40 minutes for our table to cleared, and it was 50 minutes until our party of two got our drinks.sunday night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is gone, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> times now split drink and food times and end at different times. &nbsp;the restaurant side sat empty (as it did when it was the daily grill) as the bar area was overcrowded, poorly served, just chaos.i can handle change, upgrades, my adaptive capacity is solid; the place does look great. &nbsp;it's just that the soul of my favorite hang out is gone.
came here just after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and it was still a little crowded..loud, very cute gastropub in the heart of downtown...my friend had the fish and chips which she said was a little too greasy and i had the shrimp and grits. flavor was overwhelming and was very spicy! they did give good portions though and did not skimp out on the shrimp.sodas are not refillable, although they do give you a large bottle of water to refill for the table. our server was just ok - nothing above and and beyond. i will say though that the decor was so darn cute...what a fresh concept.overall, the food probably wasn't enough to make me keep coming back , but the atmosphere is great for a drink after work.
cool space in the heart of dtla at the intersection of 6th &amp; flower in the pegasus building. if you're a fan of smoky flavored drinks would highly recommend the yellow smoke cocktail made with fresh pineapple juice, serrano chili and alipus mezcal. not too sweet, slightly spicy, very smokey and just crazy good!speck &amp; eggs is a simple great appetizer of deviled eggs topped with crispy prosciutto. it's just so tasty and easy to consume. would suggest ordering one plate per person. no joke. bison burger was quite juicy and delicious. satisfied our meaty burger cravings. loved their thin crisp brown bag fries and sriracha ketchup. they also make reasonably priced hand tossed pies. frito pie pizza was quite tasty topped with housemade chili, provolone, pickled jalape&ntilde;os and frito chips. for sweets, you absolutely cannot miss out on their insanely decadent chocolate chunk cookie nutella ice cream sandwich made with vanilla bean ice cream and rolled into bacon brittle. seeking divine intervention, now! &nbsp;don't forget recess (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>). starts at 4pm, monday-friday at the bar. food till 6:30 pm | drinks till 7 pm | $4-5-6-7 food | $5-6 dollar handles | $5 dollar well | $10-15 half liter of wine.
let me take you to school... public school that is!!! i ride by this place several times. yesterday was my first time going with a friend for hh. it was the best combo of hh food and drinks. i've been looking for a hh spot that has amazing food and i've finally found it. it was packed so that was a good sign. we got there just before the hh food was over. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 4-6:30p for food and extended to 7p for drink orders. we ordered the mac and cheese, wings, and tacos!!! all of it was amazing. the wings were perfectly seasoned and i wish i ordered more. we got the 1/2 liter wine for $10 which is a deal. you can get two big servings of wine with it. i'm beyond pleased with this spot and will definitely try their brunch soon. almost unlimited mimosas! this is a must go to spot. trust me!
i miss the old public school. i usually come in for an all-day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which they don't have anymore. according to my bf,they don't serve truffle fries :( food: - steak arugula salad (pricey): the salad was too oily, mushroom was good but it got a bit too heavy because of the oilyness. steak tasted bland. - large peanut butter and jelly cookies were delicious and it came with a glass a milk. $6. wish they were served warm with my milk. (personal preference)the place is twice as big and they come to you to take your order. no need to order first and sit down. the decor is unique. service is great. i'm willing to give this place another chance one day with different food.
first off all, the place is set up with microscopes as ambiance. rock. on. second off, the beer selection is dope. and you have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. school of house ipa is really efffing good. $4, baller on a budget.third, service. tiiiiiight.amazing service by multiple stops i've been in. my first sever erika had a charming, cheeky way about her. she looks like linda evangelista. i think she should be a hair stylist on mars. chris was another server i had and was dope. that smile! such good energy. we spoke about the universe before he dropped off the main entree.nicole was rad af, too. she was super hospitable and made me feel super welcome.nobody was pretentious and the staff rocks.also, the bartender tim, had an exceptional knowledge on beer/whiskey. really made me feel like i had a true booze connoisseur serving me. public school, good on you! :]
i was unimpressed. it was mobbed with finance bros for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;and the fries were bad, bad, bad. they served truffle fries with some sweet, lemony mayo sauce that tasted just awful. the fries themselves were mushy and sad. i put a lot of stake in how a restaurant pulls off fries because, c'mon man, it's fried potato, it's sort of hard to screw that up. the beer selection was nice, but i don't have the patience for sub par food and i don't share this obsession with boring ass gastropubs that all look the same and are way too loud to have a conversation in that everyone seems to have nowadays. i came here for lunch, too and it was slightly better, on account of it being less loud, but really not impressive. when you order diet coke they bring you a ridiculous little 8oz baby bottle and what seems like a whiskey glass of ice. i guess you just come to assume that full service restaurants with bars have soda on tap or would warn you that they are going to bring you one of those obnoxious mini bottles. the &nbsp;food is greasy and not exciting or interesting to me at all. there are a bunch of places like this, and the cutesy elementary school theme doesn't really do enough to make it stand out.
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> recess in towndon't serve beer at a math party, because i don't want to see you drink and derive! boom! luckily i've had perfect attendance at work and someone blessed me with the best spot for recess in town right next door. &nbsp;food starting from a staggering $4 up to $7, and awesome craft beer from $4-$5, oh yes ma'am my hands are raised high for this one! &nbsp;speaking of digits, why is 6 afraid of 7? because 7 8 9.c.c.b. burger (the handheld cobb)bring your scissors, because we're about to cut class! &nbsp;the best damn (don't care if i curse, put me in detention) chicken burger west of the miisiisiipii (spelling? i'm so getting docked a grade for this). &nbsp;this is burger is no joke...and i know comedy. &nbsp;chicken burger, smokey tomato jam, avocado, bibb lettuce, crispy bacon, topped with a fried egg. &nbsp;every ingredient has its purpose in your bite...soft, crunchy, light, heavy, sweet, salty, moist, dry,runny...it's all there. &nbsp;knock, knockwho's there?justinjustin who?just in time for school!
summer is over and the school is now in session. back to school is back to public school 213. &nbsp;my girlfriend and i went to public school 213 for lunch, but this is not your ordinary school cafeteria. &nbsp;our waitress, beau, was wonderful. &nbsp;i asked for recommendations and she eagerly said crispy chicken sandwich and the huntsman burger. &nbsp;she also educated me on the bison meat when i asked about the bison burger.crispy chicken sandwich ($12.00): shaved brussel kale slaw, tomato, sweet carrot habanero aoli, mustard bbq. &nbsp;the chicken is perfectly crispy and wonderfully tasty. &nbsp;the bun is my kind of bun, buttery and slightly sweet. &nbsp;i haven't had chicken sandwich that good in a long time. &nbsp;bbq bison burger ($15.00): grass fed, whiskey bbq sauce, emmental, peper bacon mushroom topping. &nbsp;not bad, but i was a little disappointed with the taste. &nbsp;it was just okay...but at least i can say i ate a bison meat before :pwe chose fries and grilled broccolini for our sides. &nbsp;the fries were the perfect choice to accompany the crispy chicken sandwich. &nbsp;the broccolini could be tastier, but i like broccolini. &nbsp;cute menu...it looks like a composition notebook.cute napkin...it looks like a piece of single ruled paper. &nbsp;cute wall...it is decorated with chemical compounds. &nbsp;private room is available for parties. &nbsp;extra credits for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and beer pong. &nbsp;this is the only school i know where you can drink beer in class :p4 stars!!public school 213 is yummylicious!!
school is back in session... only this time, it's bigger and better than ever!i walk by the location regularly on my way to and from work and have been counting down the days for the venue to reopen. true to my goody-two-shoes studious self, i was able to go to school before it officially opens to the public.first and foremost, if you remember ps612 from before, this place is more than twice as big and definitely upped the ante in its decor and menu.recess or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, runs monday - friday from 4 to 6:30pm for food and 7:00pm for drinks. well drinks are $5, food ranges from $4-$7, beers range from $4-$5 a handle (choice of 10 options), half-liter of house wine is $10 (red or white), and half-liter of mohua sauv blanc or filus malbec is $15.**$4 food: dip duo (hummus, baba ghanoush, grilled flatbread), red quinoa salad, parmesan truffle frites (with lemon aioli).**$5 food: chicken sausage, crispy cauliflower, speck &amp; eggs (deviled eggs with crispy prosciutto), and frito pie.**$6 food: schoolyard dog, american sidekicks (3 mini cheeseburgers), crispy naked wings (with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese).**$7 food: crispy ahi tuna tacos (on crispy wonton shells), adobo tacos (2x2 braised short rib &amp; roasted chicken), chorizo mac &amp; cheese, and margherita pizza.brunch is served on saturdays and sundays from 10am-4pm where you can get bottomless drinks (bloody mary, beermosa, mimosa, and michelada) for $10. brunch menu ranges from chicken sausage &amp; cheddar grits to fried jidori chicken &amp; green chili cornbread waffles to fire roasted vegetable hash &amp; eggs to eggs benefit pizza.likewise, they have a rotating live entertainment schedule with various specials:-monday is industry day + night, with 50% off your entire check.-wednesday is live dj with core drafts starting at $1 at 9pm, price going up $1 every 15 minutes until 10pm. from their dinner menu, we tried...**mezze plate ($8) with baba ghanoush, hummus, tapenade, marinated feta, and crispy chickpeas - great to share, free refill of mezze (bread) if desired, hummus was standard, nothing really stood out flavor-wise.**grilled steak salad with white truffle vinaigrette ($17) with prime flat iron steak, wild mushrooms, tomatoes, arugula, shaved fennel, toasted walnuts - i consider salad one of my main food groups and this salad did. not. disappoint. however, as good as it was, i felt like the price was a few bucks higher than what the salad was actually worth.**the huntsman burger ($14) with balsamic onions and huntsman cheese - the balsamic onions elevated the burger from just &quot;good&quot; to &quot;pretty good.&quot;**bbq bison burger ($16) with grass fed bison, whiskey bbq sauce, pepper bacon mushroom topping - good.**brown bag fries ($5) - thin and crispy, good to share!**shaved brussels &amp; kale slaw ($5) with red onions and bleu cheese crumbles - very rich and flavorful, you can definitely taste the bleu cheese.from their cocktail menu, i tried,..**crushed velvet ($10) with blackberry and blueberry reduction, lavendar, and kalsson's gold vodka - a bit on the sweeter side but very good! plus, it's served in a copper mug!**lavender vanilla ($10) with housemade vanilla bitters, lavender simple and four roses small batch - i couldn't taste the lavender or the vanilla as it was overpowered by the whiskey. personally, i wouldn't order this again.we also tried their pb&amp;j cookies (replete with a glass of milk) for dessert, a chalkboard special i believe, and as good as it was, left more to be desired. will return to try their nutella cookie ice cream sandwich.all in all, drinks and food were great, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> / recess prices are great, and the service was phenomenal. there's plenty of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> options in the area and i will definitely be adding this to the rotation!
willing to give this place another try/chance.came here on a friday night around 6:30. it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the bar section was packed. i like the theme of the restaurant as menus looked like note/scrapbooks and napkins looked like notebook paper etc. the alcohol was my favorite part of the evening.to eat i had the crispy ahi tuna tacos for myself. i understand that it's an appetizer but for the price, i felt like it was a weee bit small. i could palm and hide an entire taco in my hand. it was delicious, but either the price needs to be lowered or perhaps add a 5th taco. still hungry, i ordered myself a mezze plate (another appetizer). presentation was great and so were the 5 dipping sauces/sides: baba ghanoush, hummus (can never go wrong with that!), marinated feta, and chickpeas. the bread/pita however was way too hard and overcooked. i thought i was the only one who thought that until i shared and most of my friends were teling me the same. i kind of wanted to let our waitress know but we were planning to leave soon and didn't want to spend more time there.i did mention i am willing to come back here. this time however, no appetizers. just entrees (so i can have a bigger meal and to review), and alcohol of course.anyone know what those protesters outside the restaurant on 9/4 were clamoring about?
let me school you.there's two locations - one in culver city &quot;no. 310&quot; and this new location &quot;no. 213&quot;. i'm lucky i'm by both. it is a great place to eat, drink, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as their menu has a variety with decent pricing. but i noticed the wait in getting your food at this location (and the other) is still a bit slow. the staff and staff service was excellent - very friendly and generous to check on the the order.grilled steak and salad with white truffle vinaigrette ($16) - you must absolutely love truffle to enjoy this salad to the very last bite because there's a lot of truffle flavor. i love truffle anything but after realizing truffle just coats everything i prefer small dosage of truffle. the salad has a nice mix of greens such as wild mushrooms, tomatoes, arugula, shaved fennel, toasted walnuts, grana panado. but you can't really taste the salad as it's overly coated with the truffle flavor. i hope someone from the kitchen watched food network's chopped where the judges dislike truffle oil on the final product for the mere fact that it just hides the real flavor of the raw ingredients. to rid the &quot;truffleness&quot; i dug in my salad for the tomatoes as they gave me that separation. they should mix the dressing with more vinaigrette and a very small dabble of truffle to get a hint of truffle - by the end of my meal my palate was getting bored with the truffle flavor. the steak, on point and no complaint. it was perfectly prepared. $16 seems out of line for this pretty salad and think it needs to be shaved down because it felt like a worthy $12 salad in my opinion. recommend. there will be no hesitation to travel 57 floors down for eats around the corner.until the next review...
wolf-and-crane-bar-los-angeles
they have an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> till 7 pm. &nbsp;the service is consistently great. &nbsp;cool spot.
we had a wonderful <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at wolf &amp; crane on friday night! excellent bar service and super space! this place is great for special events and groups!
nice little bar with unique drink selections using japanese spirits and brews. they have an all day sunday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but can get too crowded in the evenings
a great bar to hang out in while at little tokyo. there's a patio and two inside seating areas, and apparently dogs are allowed as well. they have a great selection of japanese whiskey and whiskey in general, and they make solid drinks. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is only monday through friday!
i've been to here a few times with co workers, really small but cozy, smaller groups are best for this place. it can get really pricey even during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but overall its one of the best bars in little tokyo.
solid drinks. great crowd. creative events, &nbsp;good music. awesome design. i think is turning into my neighborhood spot. great to stop by on a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, a date, or right before a little tokyo dinner.
first time coming here and already love it. whether it's on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or not, i would still recommend you all to check this place out. it's a pretty cozy bar to have drinks with your friends or spouse. not really sure how it's like on the weekends, but from what i heard from the bartender, it was pretty busy. seats are available at the bar, patio or inside (away from the bar) they run <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from mondays to fridays and all day sundays. there are tvs &nbsp; &nbsp;if you want to catch a game or something but there's not much finger good for you to choose so this place is totally good for drinks.drink choices? &nbsp;wolf and crane won me over. a can of sapporo &nbsp;and a shot of japanese whiskey (akashi) for $9! yes, that is correct. by the way, you don't have to shoot the shot, &nbsp;you can always sip it as you go. if you are a whiskey drinker, you know what i mean. &nbsp;there's also cocktail on <span class="highlighted">happy &nbsp;hour</span>, however, there is an additional charge of $2.it was a sunday evening, so there weren't that many people, but the weekends may differ. service was good, and there are japanese snacks available at the bar for purchase. don't forget, you are surrounded by food in that area. recommended to check this place out.
$5 drinks at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! doesn't get better than that!i love the laidback and minimalist vibe of this bar. it's not overdone or pretentious like a lot of other nearby bars in the dtla area. plus, while i was there they were bumping really good old school r&amp;b and hip hop!
i've only been for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> twice but i do have to say: the prices are very reasonable and the selection of drinks (in general) is great. the place itself is pretty cool, they have the bar area and another side where you can sit along a wall. there's a dj booth in there so i'm sure it gets packed at night.
really dope atmosphere.love that it's in little tokyo.they have a nice selection of drinks and mixed drinks on the menu are really cool and delicious.would definitely come back.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is good too but wish there were more options on that menu.nice bartendervery cool japanese snacks for sale.love it.
i ordered the wolf and crane and got a jameson shot and a can soporro. i originally wanted to try the asashi japanese whiskey so i was disappointed to hear that the whiskey is stuck in a port somewhere due to a worker strike. i did not hold them accountable for that. that was just my bad luck. now, my review is to review their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and whether it was worth my money. the bottom line is no. it was not worth my money. the can of soporro (i have never had the can) is horrible! i'd rather drink sopporo on the tap or in a glass bottle. but 9 dollars really? the can of soporro is probably worth no more than $1.00 so that makes my shot of jameson worth $8. how ridiculous is that. anyways. their beer selection is alright. for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they have a good selection of an ipa and other light ale that one might be into. but once again it was just too ridiculous for me. that wolf and crane really disappointed me. i went to &quot;the falls&quot; in downtown la and they had a drink and shot combo for $5.00. now that is an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. but they served us stella artois or modelo or tequila or whiskey. heck yes. so i would not be visiting this place again.
this review is for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only. &nbsp;we decided to check it out based on the reviews and because it just looked pretty cool. &nbsp;the place was cute. &nbsp;it's clean. &nbsp;nicely but minimally decorated. &nbsp;what turned me off was how disinterested the bartender looked as we walked in. &nbsp;i get that it was relatively early in the evening and he was the only one working on the floor, but even after he saw us walking in he just went back to chatting with other customers at the bar. &nbsp;he didn't even bother to acknowledge our presence there. &nbsp;no real eye contact. &nbsp;no smile. &nbsp;no hi. &nbsp;and trust me, he was not busy. &nbsp;there were about 7 people in the whole place when we walked in. &nbsp;i would probably find other <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spots next time.
seems more like a beer place than a cocktail one. our group of about 6 got there around 7 on a thursday night and it was pretty dead.willing to give this place another shot, preferably on the weekend.no sign outside; kind of gives it that overplayed speakeasy perception.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is until 7pm, on select brews.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> monday-friday from 5pm-7pm &amp; all day sunday!lucky for me, i decided to leave my grandma-ness behind this past sunday during the labor day weekend *girly scream. wolf &amp; crane was the second bar we came to that night. our party of 7 arrived around 12:00am and it was a chill type of environment. a few friends mentioned during the regular weekend (friday/saturdays) the place gets packed and there is even a little dance floor on the opposite side of the bar. once we started to leave around 12:45pm, wolf &amp; crane was a little more packed than when we first walked in.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials include a few beer options, wine and well drinks for $5, as well as cocktails ranging from different prices for the house special, high balls, and low balls. try the eastsider ($10)! delicious &amp; refreshing.parking anywhere in the general area is a pain in the behind. we scored street parking close to angel city brewery and walked over.
been here a few times already and really enjoy the laidback feel of this place. usually not that crowded and has a very clean, urban look. they offer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 5-7p with select beers and well drinks at reasonable prices. they also have a great selection of interesting/unique cocktails, pretty tasty if i say so myself :)i'll usually hop over here and grab a drink while waiting for shinsengumi to calm itself. plus, a nice little buzz while enjoying your ramen is pretty amazing.
super chill place, all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on sundays (5 dollar drafts, well drinks, and wine). and parking's free on sundays! love it. i saw a dj booth at the corner, which was luckily unmanned when we were there.
this bar is it. they've got craft cocktails, a good selection of beer, friendly bartenders, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and a modern atmosphere that adds just enough of a chill vibe to make that cocktail pretty damn perfect. oh and the drinks are amazing! it gets better..it's in little tokyo, so you're surrounded by tons of great places to grab a bite or make a night of hopping around from bar to bar.
this is a gem of a place. there is a drink option for every taste and the atmosphere was perfect for our group of 20+. the service was excellent and although we planned on being there just for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (5-7pm) we stayed longer cause it was just that fun. the arrangement for food delivery from pitfire pizza was fast, fresh and easy! the bartenders were super friendly and on point so i highly recommend this place. i've already had multiple people ask when are we coming back... very soon indeed.
jtown scene. went in may and it was crowded! new place in the area with cocktail drinks. very very very small bar. like the decor. since its jtown, be prepare to take some time to find parking. theres parking lots and street parking but remember to read and ask about closing times. i don't chill around jtown often but if i do, i would want to check out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
yes, wolf &amp; crane is the newest bar in little tokyo. it is super chill, hip and best of all, unpretentious. they have a good number of craft beers and tasty mixed cocktails. there's no food &nbsp;but i was told by the bartender that you can bring in outside food. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is weeknights, 5-7there's jazz night, game night and also a dj spinning on different nights of the week!look out for the logo of a wolf &amp; a crane when trying to find this place. it's also right next to subway!cheers!
as a new little tokyo resident, wolf &amp; crane is easily becoming one of my favorite bars in the area. super chill.. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day sunday... half of top shelf drinks monday... what's not to love? i'm hoping to step up my whiskey game with their decent whiskey selection. my favorites are their highball and wolf &amp; crane.
just found out about this place last weekend, and i'm really liking it! great whiskey drinks ($8-$10) and in the awesome little tokyo neighborhood. they do have $5 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks, but i'm not sure what days/times. there wooden bar is very sleek looking, and there is plenty of seating in the bar. they have a dj at night which is a nice touch if you feel like dancing.
i don't live here but places like this make me think about moving to a new area. next to far bar this is the next best locals spot that i'm sure in time will be a little tokyo favorite. the interior emits an appropriate japanese influence with great manga artwork in its entrance. the bartenders are friendly and their house drinks are good but noticeably under development. they have a nice smoking area that's also easily mistaken for the entrance. everything is reasonably priced and a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu if that's your kind if thing. overall, a great night cap to any evening. check it out!- r
i would rate them 0 stars but i have to choose something. beware, they charge you more when your intoxicated. check your bill when paying out. i payed with my card one time and they charged me double &quot;on accident&quot; and i over heard the people next to me getting charged full price during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
as a current little tokyo/arts district resident, i've always felt that a good dive bar was the only thing missing in the 'hood. so when i heard this bar was opening up shop right across the street from me, i jumped for joy!i made it out here yesterday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work with the bf because he needed to watch the niner game somewhere closeby. while they do have tvs, i must note that they are on mute. they also don't have hh menus but you can just ask the bartender for that info.there were only a handful of other people there so it did feel kinda dead but it was a monday evening on a holiday week.bathrooms are clean and smell nice, there are hooks for your bag at the bar, and there is an outdoor smoking area which faces 2nd street for you smokers. i thought that was actually the entrance but it's over more to your right if you're facing the bar outside.
i really love the decor of this place. when i walked in i could smell the newness of all the wood working in there. i could tell a lot of though went into the design and the over all feel of the place.so we ended up here on xmas eve at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i had the cuba libra which was fantastic. it had perfect balance of sweet, acid, and effervescence. i lot of times if i ask for a cuba libre at other places, they basically had you a rum and coke. then for my second drink i had their house special highball, which is johnnie red and soda, which was also good, as to be expected.i think wolf &amp; crane is a wonderful addition to little tokyo, and i look forward to visiting them in the future.
so nice to have this new bar so close to my downtown office. &nbsp;it's walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in little tokyo. &nbsp;i only stopped in for a beer, but they had a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu with many good choices of draft beers, mixed drinks (with cool names like &quot;grey wolf&quot;), and even some nice wines. &nbsp;i had the eagle rock solidarity on draft, which the bartender suggested and i thought was perfect. &nbsp;i was told there is a dj on the weekends, so will have to come back and check it out. &nbsp;thursday is soul night, i think. &nbsp;must try.
i came here after getting some dinner in little tokyo. we wanted to just relax and drink some cocktails, thus wolf and crane appeared on our yelp. we made it just in time for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and we seated ourselves onto the bar. i quickly noticed the japanese inspired decor. there was a theme revolving around japanese whiskey for their were multiple specialities that featured the whiskey. i ordered myself the bar's interpretation of a moscow mule; however their vodka was replaced with whiskey. i did not enjoy the drink unfortunately. i also ordered one of the craft beers, and it was quite refreshing (forgot the name). after a while, the booze began to kick in and i needed to use the restroom. i thought it was interesting that they had manga snippets as the design in their restroom. once of the factors that made us leave early would be the ambience at the bar. it was strangely empty, and i remember customers coming into the bar with their dogs. i do not mind pets, but it can be awkward having a dog bark at you while you are drinking some whiskey indoors. i would tell the owner to stick to the classics for the cocktails, and to find a way to create a more lively and comfortable atmosphere for the bar.
with shochu and sake being the beverages of choice in little tokyo, there aren't too many places that have a fully stocked bar within the area. with that being said, wolf &amp; crane bar would be the first pub i would hit. why? three reasons.(1) clean. i don't know if the place has been open for long, but it's really tidy. including, the restrooms. soft wooden decor, small sized bar area, with several seats available. not a huge venue, but there's a make shift smoking patio in the front, for those of you that favor the vape and cigarettes. once inside, to the left, there's a few tables to hold a decent sized group. think about a casual weekday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or even a late sunday get together. cozy, but loud and vibrant enough to get the mingling started.(2) music. nothing gets me thinking more about the 80's than this hit song by the band simple minds, called &quot;don't you (forget about me).&quot; the popular flick called the breakfast club is what made this song famous. also, i believe i heard the cure as well. the song - &quot;pictures of you&quot; was a great single by the british rock band from their 1989 album disintegration. beats like this only add to the intrigue of this dive bar. be there or be square, right?(3) people. ranging from middle aged professionals, the cool nerds, and an ever growing rise of the hipsters. many of my fellow yelpers also seem to frequent this place as well - joe p, sasi m, helena h, joseph a, ru c, christine t, justin y, catalina t, and chanel c. peeps with personality and those that would definitely get the party started proper. i even ran into marvy s during my last visit. of all the random places! but, with my luck, i meet the best kind of people.with semi stiff drinks at prices that are never too stiff, why wouldn't i stop by here for a quick beverage to relieve my quenching thirst? remember, it's ok to indulge in alcohol. not to get too technical, but according to chemistry, alcohol is a solution.
pretty cool bar. very chill. the place is not too crowded or too loud. the bartenders are nice and prompt. drinks are affordable and taste pretty decent. heck, even the restrooms are clean!! this is for sure a nice little hidden gem in little tokyo that i sure hope to visit more often. the vibe of the place is truly awesome! there is no pressure to look or act a certain way. everyone is very friendly and they have some cool jams playing. heard they have a dj every now and then as well. no real dress code but cmon, you girls know you wanna dress up and you guys know you wanna look fly, anything goes here. everyone is very welcoming. even the bouncer checking ids was really nice. this place is open from 3pm to 2am on the weekends and weekdays from 5pm until 2am. there is even a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> monday through friday from 5pm-7pm. drinks:wolf and crane has a good range of drinks. anything from beer (such as sapporo, el segundo ipa, craftsman heavenly hef and some ales), wines, mixed drinks you will find it there, they even sell cigarettes!!!*gin trap - $10gin, tonic and a hint of grapefruit. very refreshing. nice gin taste without being a watered down drink. if you like the bitter taste with a little sweetness of grapefruit, i would highly recommend this drink. the ingredients are well combined in which neither flavors overpowers each other (good job, cute bartender)*moscow mule (not sure how much this one was since i didn't get the first round)the drink was very eh.. i've had better. it wasn't one of the best ones i've had. something about the taste was just off. maybe too much ginger beer in mine? there seemed to have been way too much ginger beer and not enough vodka for my taste. *baja buck - $9my favorite drink of the night. the tequila, grape fruit and ginger beer made this drink a tasty buzz for me. there is a hint of lime of course to go with it as well. the ginger beer here was less than with the moscow mule. you do get the hint of tequila in it making it an outstanding drink and that grape fruit flavor in there just surprises you. *old fashionnot bad! very very smooth and i'm not really a whiskey drinker but this particular glass i shared was tasty. it was garnished with a little cherry piece on top that i was told was there to enhance the taste of the drink. i don't recall the brand of whiskey they used to make the drink but if i remember it, i will update this with that information.
perhaps you, like me, spot the rather snazzy neon origami above a door and outdoor patio illuminated from above with strung lights and think &quot;push.&quot; then maybe &quot;pull?&quot; then you start to realize this door isn't going to open. &nbsp;the real entrance 50 ft. over is unmarked, without sign and even among the staff looks like it might belong to a construction project. &nbsp;i suppose it feels a little more like a bar or some underground nightclub. &nbsp;but there are going to be a whole lot of people pushing on that door. &nbsp;wolf &amp; crane is a new watering hole (and exclusively that) in little tokyo. &nbsp;don't expect a large selection of japanese whiskey or sake-inspired this or asian flavors that -- this is a fairly on-trend couple of cocktails and craft brews sort of establishment. &nbsp;even the japanese decorations on the inside (the random manga wallpaper, various prints) feel a little bit like an afterthought. &nbsp;it has kind of rustic look some popular amongst the kids these days, but i kid. &nbsp;the interior is nice, dark with ropes dividing a more intimate small benches area from the main bar and high tops and where you'll find that on-trend warehouse lighting. &nbsp;many people comment on the smooth bar, made of light wood and covered in epoxy which helps give it its matte look, i learned surprisingly but just overhearing and not by the hard investigative reporting you've come to expect from yelp.it is nice, casual and rather simple. &nbsp;it's not cheesy. &nbsp;it is not, say, ebanos for example. &nbsp;there's a lot of johnnie red above the bar. the specials both feature it one with soda. one with a sapporo. &nbsp;there too are tvs above the bar, housed in mirrored boxes. &nbsp;i guess the theory is that after a certain time they'll get turned off and tah-dah, it's like the tvs never existed and people will have to actually talk to each other. &nbsp;i like this idea. &nbsp;this seems like a fine idea. &nbsp;but i wonder how long it will be before someone complains that such and such a game isn't over yet, or this or that. &nbsp;it won't be that long. &nbsp;still, i like the sentiment. &nbsp;house cocktails run $9-10 and lean towards the sweeter side. most end in soda. and yes fernet makes an appearance. &nbsp;this drink ($10) is mostly fernet and root beer. &nbsp;and tastes like well, bitter root beer. &nbsp;which isn't exactly a bad thing. &nbsp;i read that fernet is a favorite amongst bartenders just because no one really knows what to do with it. &nbsp;this lends itself well to trying new things and there's a little bit of a conversation starter this. &nbsp;indeed, in my short time in the bar a half dozen or so of the house 'highballs' of the stuff go out. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> runs from 5-7 with $5 netting you one of several things: wells, a pair of wines and a pair of beers. &nbsp;normally, the 10 beers on tap (no word on anything in bottles) run $5-8 and wines run $7-11. there's a section on the menu for else. &nbsp;snacks are 2. &nbsp;little bagged japanese snacks. &nbsp;and cigarettes ($10). &nbsp;it turns out what i assumed was the entrance is a smoking patio. &nbsp;this makes sense in hindsight and you smokers out there, know smokes are available behind the bar. &nbsp;i've moved onto my second when a man who looks like he has some war stories bellies up to the bar and gets a double of the johnnie. &nbsp;in a bar filled with mostly 20 and 30-somethings i'm comforted that this sort of character has appeared. &nbsp;but downtown is usually good about this sort of thing.
bar-ama-los-angeles
came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and got the nachos and shrimp chalupa-both were excellent! if you're a fan of mezcal and spicy cocktails, i'd recommend la pina. otherwise, their margarita with mezcal is just as good.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. short rib taquitos, chorizo nachos and margaritas. all this while there was a taco fest a few blocks away. it beat the fest.
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. reservation are reccome need. valet parking available. $5 nachos are yummy! brussels sprouts made perfect. enchiladas are amazing.
nom nom nom! the chorizo nachos are amazing! best nachos so far in my opinion. they have a late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for food and cocktails. i wasn't a fan of the michelada, though :/ this is a great place to come after work.
bar ama is a must if you're in dtla along spring street. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a steal and deliciously so. the super nachos are equally tex and mex, the flavor of quesadillas always changes in some small pleasant way, fantastic tequila or mescal cocktails (though a bit too pricey, but justifiable), decent beer, respectable logout selection, huevos rancheros (!!!), satisfying enchiladas, and very genuine, personable service. i'm not a big customer service person, but the bar staff has been indifferent, and there are some dishes, like nana's fritos pie, that aren't good. a definite brunch or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot, but i don't imagine myself here outside those times.
amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! the nachos are a must try. we got there a little early, but hh is only at the bar so make sure to try and grab a spot there! the bartenders were great too
i love bar ama! it's not too big and it's never overcrowded (when i usually go there sunday afternoons or during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>). they have plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. and their s.n.h. (super nacho <span class="highlighted">hour</span>) is always a must! the nachos are delicious and they're only $5! the drinks are a bit pricey, that's definitely where the bill adds up. i've had the ama enchiladas and these are amazing!! they're not your traditional enchiladas, but there is so much flavor in every bite. overall, this place has a cool, downtown vibe with some delicious food and drinks. i'd recommend trying this place during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you won't be disappointed.
zapatista is zapa-tasty!! &nbsp;$5 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> nachos are the bomb.unable to score a thursday night reservation for baco mercat, we decided to wait the 30-45 minutes having a drink and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> nibs at bar ama. &nbsp;the place was pretty empty, but i'm not sure why, everything was delicious. &nbsp;the bartender was super friendly and helpful. &nbsp;the zapatista sounded good to me, especially so when she told me that the liquor in it is something in between a tequila and a mezcal. &nbsp;sold! &nbsp;it was so great. &nbsp;cilantro and spice in my drink? &nbsp;yes please, i will have another.the nachos on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> were really great too. &nbsp;the prices for dinner were a little high, but i would probably come back here to eat sometime. &nbsp;i will definitely be returning for a cocktail!
bar ama is great: great atmosphere, great food. my favorites are the cauliflower and of course the guacamole. i've also had the enchiladas, the chicken taco and the ceviche. a great tip is to go here in the <span class="highlighted">hour</span> before they close. they have an amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that shouldn't be missed!! if i lived closer, i would go to bar ama all the time. as it is, every time i go to downtown, i stop in here.
was at bar ama for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. best nachos ever! i love that it's nacho cheese and not melted cheese. the mezcal mix drink they have on their menu was the best. (cant remember the name). mezcal tends to have a smokey taste and is an acquired taste, so beware.
i only went for super nachos <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but it was awesome! we ordered super nachos with chorizo and a side of guacamole. (we shouldn't have gotten the side... the guac was good, but huge!) the nachos were probably the best nachos i've ever had. the cheese was nice and melted and never really got stiff or had that skin that usually happens to melted cheese as it sits. i definitely want to come back for more... or at least for some more nachos ;)
come in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! they close at 3 so they can transition to dinner at 5, so in between they offer a small menu at the bar. i am so glad we stayed because the food was delicious. the bartender made my friend a tequila, cilantro, pineapple &amp; serrano chili cocktail which turned out amazing. we had their nachos, shrimp chalupa and bean quesadilla, i highly recommend all three for sharing. wonderful service and food!
the mix of mexican, texas, and vegetarian food options was surprisingly delicious. a must is the cauliflower cilantro pesto dish $11! the puffy tacos for $7, the shrimp and chicken were the best, but sadly the potato taco was too bland. and of course their margaritas were on point!! during super nacho <span class="highlighted">hour</span> (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>) i got a margarita for $9, but beware <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals are only at the bar which they should think about changing because the place is so small. my favorite cocktail was called la pi&ntilde;a, i think, it had pineapple and serrano chiles, a little sweet with spicy for $11. we also got a beer pitcher for $14 that is great for sharing. overall great late night spot with a different take on mexican food.
terrible service, i went to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> around 4pm, there were almost no customers and the bartender somehow ignore me as well as his two helpers,the margarita was awful and the nachos made me throw up, the place looked super cool tho'.
the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tacos were not good. all i tasted was oily mushy tortilla and with salsa. plus the waiter was ridiculously rude to us for no reason. their drinks are pretty damn good though. probably the best michelada i've ever had and the drink with hibiscus was delicious too
stumbled upon this hidden bar/restaurant while wondering around dtla and we love it! the first time we went here we had such excellent service from the bartender.. (i don't remember his name. but he had a raspy voice and curly hair). he was awesome! we took time to chat with us while we were there, what he recommends and also gave us other places to try out in dtla as we continued our venture. haven't tried the food yet, but <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cocktails are a plus! my favorite is the snakes blood.
came with a large group and got to try a bunch of different dishes. some of the ones i really liked are the tex-mex queso dip, fried squash blossoms, and the cauliflower. some things i didn't care for were the taquitos (too hard), chicken mole fajitas (no flavor), and my spicy margarita. cool spot to hang out for drinks, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and group gatherings. it was pretty busy on a monday night so try to make reservations.
best. cauliflowers. ever. everything was jam-packed with flavor and awesomeness. came here for dinner and another time for hh. dinner was great but i think i'll pass on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>/'super nachos <span class="highlighted">hour</span>'. the nachos were definitely a healthy portion for $5 and decent tasting but their drink menu just was too limited (wasn't a fan of their michelada or their small pour of the sauvignon blanc). will be back for dinner though!
if you want some bomb queso, bar ama is the place to go! i live right above it, so i come here quite often. i love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the puffy taco is kind of greasy but taste really good! my favorite dish is probably the beef tongue.
sadly disappointed by bar ama. when my friend and i walked in there were 3 other tables seated and one person at the bar. &nbsp;i asked the hostess for a table for 4 and she looked at me as if i had just asked her to solve a quantum physics problem. &nbsp;thinking maybe she hadn't hear me the first time, i ask again. &nbsp;blank stare. &nbsp;my friend then remembers we have a reservation and gives the hostess the name. &nbsp;and yet again, she gives us the blankest of stares. &nbsp;once we finally get on the same page she walks us to a table in the corner surrounded by the only other tables in the place that are occupied. &nbsp;maybe they only had one server on staff, but i thought it was odd that the only tables being seated were all concentrated to one area, and the corner at that. when my friend and i sit down we quickly ask about <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks. &nbsp;the hostess tells us that <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is only available at the bar, not at the tables. &nbsp;she stares at us blankly for a little longer and then walks away with nothing else to say, not even an &quot;enjoy your meal&quot; or &quot;your server will be over shortly.&quot;we had 2 different servers over the course of our meal, and i will give them credit for being very attentive and communicative when it took a long time for our second round of drinks to come. &nbsp;they were the only saving grace to this place. &nbsp;well that and the queso and guacamole.the brussel sprouts were under cooked and as a result tasted entirely too bitter. &nbsp;the puffy tacos, which are a secret off menu item, were nothing special. at the end of the meal, the queso &amp; guac, was split between 3 people, we each had 2 drinks and a puffy taco, and we ended up paying $50 each. maybe if you can find a space a the bar to take advantage of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices, this place is worth a try.
pretty much in love with this place after trying it a few nights ago with a friend! margarita..pretty great. &nbsp;i also tried the michelada. this was my first time trying this..and lemme just say, the shit is spicy. but i like itttttt! it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so we just ordered shrimp tacos..the guac..and the quesadilla. &nbsp;i realize the portion sizes may be small for others..but it's like tapas style and honestly. i was full after one taco. but hey. maybe that's just me. &nbsp;i really enjoyed the presentation of everything. but i will say the chips for the guac were super greasy. like. dripping. and it's one thing to eat fattening stuff. but to like see the fat when you're eating it. yeaaaa not what we're trying to do here lol. so maybe work on that bar ama? the restaurant itself is def &quot;quaint&quot; in size...but that's what makes it charming. &nbsp;they play music in the background. like actual music u want to hear. so that's a big bonus and makes this the perfect spot for a outing wit a few friends/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>/or a cute date night (minus the making out in a booth shit. stay at home for that) anyways. i'll be coming back here for sure!
amazinggg mexican food (tex mex-ish) in dtla. serioulsly you must go. the queso is life changing. i suggest going with a group of friends and trying a little of everything. great drinks - loved the nacho. &nbsp;if you can't get reservations, there is a community table of 6 seats you can wait for, as well as the bar. &nbsp;there is also a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-5 (not sure which days) make a reservation asap!
three stars because we love the food. &nbsp;minus the 4 i would have given it for a simple reason: &nbsp;if you're hoping to be one of 12 people lucky enough to nab a seat at the unpublicized <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> you're in luck. if however you trust the restaurant's website, open all day on saturday, you're out of luck. when i mentioned to the hostess that the website makes no mention of this she made no effort to accommodate and i had the impression her &quot;sorry,&quot; was as far as it would go. the website will continue to fool everyone who looks at it into believing you can eat all day. not.
bar ama is a great place for a margarita if you're downtown. unlike las perlas, they serve lunch and dinner. they also have a variety of tequilas and mescals to satisfy anyone's needs! for lunch, they usually have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with small plates. for dinner, they have a full menu. if you find yourself there for lunch, i highly recommend the margarita pitcher (to split with another person of course) and their nachos. if you're there for dinner, get the frito pie! it's an absolute must. this is an all new take on mexican comfort food! ps, it gets busy at night so be sure to get a reservation or you'll be stuck waiting an extra 45 minutes to an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> for a table!
what a &nbsp;little gem this place is! they have queso!! well technically its queso on nachos but being from the midwest ill take what i can get. nachos and the guacamole were soo good. they have a pretty amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as well.
the restaurant has a nice decor and its on one of the nicer looking streets in downtown.1. &nbsp;bar open. dining area isn't. the problem is that the restaurant does not open until 5 pm. on a sunday, that does not make any sense. on a monday afternoon, i can understand but not a weekend. the bar was packed because of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. there was nowhere to sit and getting a drink from the bar was near impossible with 1 bartender. i didn't even bother.i was annoyed to say the least. i drove from west l.a. to meet some friends and wanted to relax. 2. &nbsp;the food the food is ok for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the nachos came out and weren't hot; just luke warm. i have to deduct points right off the bat. &nbsp;secondly the shrimp tacos took forever. 3. &nbsp;service the objective is to provide a good enough <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to compel someone to have dinner there. &nbsp;the host and hostess did not offer us a place to sit (plenty of empty tables) and evidently no waitress was on staff. so i stood there getting in way of people. pretty awkward. the staff at the bar is just not attentive enough. &nbsp;when i have to ask for another beer and i get a response such as 'yeah i'm mixing right now'. &nbsp;that's unacceptable. &nbsp;the bartender's job is to watch the drjnks. if i do ask, the proper reply is to say 'i'll be right with you'; show proper etiquette. when the bartender complains because we split it on 4 cards, it's another annoyance. &nbsp;i wanedt to like this place but they are not ready for prime time. they need to work on their service and their set up.
i walked in and was disappointed that they only served nachos, tacos, limited drink menu.i enjoyed my nachos, shrimp taco, sangria, and margarita, but at $37 including tip, it just wasn't worth it. &nbsp;they call this time before dinner at 5:30 pm their super nacho <span class="highlighted">hour</span>. the service was just ok. pleasant, but not super attentive and friendly. they didn't refill my water and gave me the wrong receipt twice. they also overcharged me for my <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> margarita but just left it alone as it was already a hassle getting the right receipt.if you must go, i recommend the shrimp taco. also, check out their selection of liquor as they carry brands not commonly seen at bars.
i've been here a few times after work for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the nachos are a hearty meal in itself but the shrimp ceviche with spinach and pomegranate seeds is so yummy i usually get both. i know the combo sounds strange and its not what traditionally goes into ceviche but its a must try.the last time i went though, the hostess stalked me on the way to the restroom. she was relatively polite and i reassured her that i was going to buy a drink after i take a piss (okay, i didn't use those exact words because i was being polite, but that's how i felt) but still, i was a little turned off. she had a menu ready in her hand. i was in a suit and tie and not looking like a bum so i think that was very rude of her.oh, and the glasses were dirty but only and it was probably water stains.
food great!! bartender shane-- great!!!!!! food-- great!!!! prices--- way too expensive!!!!!$6.00 per shrimp taco???? really????? where's the free lap-dance???totally overpriced mexican food---- i mean, really!!! a breakfast bean and cheese taco for $5.00 each???? come on!!!!the bartender shane rocked -- he was attentive and sweet--- but the prices are too high for puffy shrimp tacos--------sorry -- mas malo wins------ (think about. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for the tacos)--/-- remember that this is downtown and not beverly hills--it's not duck confit or fois gras--- lower the prices for the tacos!!!!!!!! jesus!!!!
came to celebrate my birthday on a saturday afternoon during some <span class="highlighted">hour</span> which the entire menu isn't available, only <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. we were seated quickly and the hostess was super friendly, allowing us to sit at a table near the bar since we had a larger party. we ordered a few of the appetizers which came out really quick. the food was great and the guac was amazing, just like everyone said. we had the strawberry basil margarita which i loved. the server was also the only bartender and since it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> it was a little chaotic and he did seem very overwhelmed.i probably would give this place more stars if we hadn't noticed something which made us all lose our appetites... when the server, who had very long hair, went to pick up food from the back station he pulled his hair lose and began scratching his head. like really going at it. okay, that's fine we all get itchy but pleaseeeee wash your hands. he absolutely failed to do so. he tied it back up, grabbed the food and presented it to customers at the bar. barf. i've worked in restaurants before, there is a certification class everyone must take to be able to work in a restaurant, so there is really no excuse. it's against health code violations and not to mention common sanitation habits. i was completely shocked to see this type of thing right before my own eyes. at that point we didn't even care to mention it was my birthday to receive any complimentary dessert. no thanks.
fun place to celebrate my sister's birthday during her visit to la! we always have to indulge her craving for &quot;mexican&quot; food when she's visiting as good mexican food is still hard to find in dc where she lives. we got here around 6 pm, so the restaurant hasn't totally filled up yet, but by the time we left, the place was hoppin'! &nbsp;unfortunately, we were seated near the kitchen and it was a hot day, so we were a little warm in our spot. or maybe it was that yummy margarita that was responsible for that extra heat i was feeling? who knows? in any case, get a pitcher of their margarita! it's nice and strong and perfect for a group of 4-5 people! we ordered the guac and the queso with chorizo for the table to start. yum! the queso was runnier than i would have liked but who can resist such cheesy goodness? the chips were just perfect for dipping. the celebrant was very <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, despite being bummed at first for missing their super nacho <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but we had chips, guac and queso on the table, so she was able to create her own nacho dish! my husband and i shared the mondongo which had oxtails, tripe, and chickpeas. i liked the oxtail, but this dish had too much chickpeas! it should have had more broth and less chickpeas. it came with flour tortillas too but we didn't even touch that as we were on the verge of being too full at that point. also, not a good dish to order when you're feeling warm. it's more of a winter dish. the others ordered taquitos, mom's enchiladas with borracho beans and rice and a short rib chalupa. they were all <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with their food. we also ordered the cauliflower with cilantro pesto dish and boy, was that good! it'll make you a cauliflower lover, if you're not already. we didn't have dessert with all that food we had. we were definitely primed though to continue our celebration at another bar a few blocks away. next time, super nacho <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and more of that margarita!!!
i really only have 2 words to sum this place up: puffy tacos! aka sean &quot;puffy&quot; tacos aka diddy t's aka puffy t's aka p. tacs shakur aka the t, the a, the c, the o the s... that's tacos -- hold up, puff tacos!!!i wouldn't order anything else from bar ama unless you are a vegan. &nbsp;if you are a vegan, i feel bad for you son, but in this case, you have 99 problems but fake queso ain't one! &nbsp;the cashew queso is pretty damn good too! i personally add chorizo to it, but i'm not a hell burning hippy vegan. &nbsp;their regular queso dip is even more delish and their chips are crisp and hold a lot of dip. &nbsp;i took a to go bag home to eat while watching the game the next day... let's just say they didn't make it to the next day!as for the ambiance. &nbsp;this is a great place to take a date. &nbsp;disclaimer: you should know that approximately 90% of the people in this establishment are very good looking. &nbsp;this includes the staff. &nbsp;at one point i looked around and said to my date, cathie, &quot;i might not be the best looking person in here&quot;. &nbsp;she looked around and re-assured me i was. &nbsp;although, jeremy, one of their best waiters is someone you definitely wouldn't kick out of bed for eating crackers... or bar ama tortilla chips!all this talk, i think i will go there tonight for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and one of their stiff cocktails! &nbsp;see you there!
looked forward to visiting this tex-mex restaurant for a while since i'm originally from texas and miss my style of mexican food. overall, it was really good, if not completely satisfying.we got there early for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which was great. reasonably priced drinks and some appetizers. the nachos were probably my favorite part of the evening. once we sat down, we had the infamous puffy tacos, which i thought lived up to the hype. these were not part of my tex-mex history, but i enjoyed them.my biggest anticipation was also my biggest disappointment. the queso. in texas, it's quite common to have this ooey-gooey cheese dip, often made from something like velveeta. &nbsp;most restaurants here in los angeles serve something that is less a dip and more like melted cheese. this queso just didn't have much taste. i get that it's supposed to be more high-end, but i expect at least the same amount or more flavor.if i lived closer to downtown i would definitely be back a lot more!
i went in for lunch and it was relatively busy for a tuesday afternoon with what seemed to be the business crowds from surrounding companies. we decided to have a seat at the bar since it was open and the table offered was crappy. the bartender was so nice and offered up some great recommendations. he even let us sample some of the mezcal and beer that we asked about even though we both already had cocktails. this is not your normal &quot;mexican&quot; restaurant and i believe they are actually marketed as &quot;tex-mex&quot;. i was so disappointed that the puffy tacos that we drove out for, were no longer available so i opted for the carne tacos and my boyfriend had the shrimp ones. both were really good, but i really wanted those adobada and pineapple ones.we also shared the following items: yellowtail ceviche, chicharron, queso with chorizo. on top of this, we had 2 cocktails each. while everything was yummy, i found the $125 bill to be excessive for lunch. especially for tex mex. i would come back when they offer a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as i don't think its a drive for that price from the west side.
given that the name reminds me of the spanish &quot;amar&quot;, i think i could really come to love this bar. it's casual, but not so much so that you wouldn't want to come here for a special occasion. in fact, the night i visited a large group was also there celebrating a birthday. they got lucky though, in terms of seating space it's a pretty small area. i don't think the bar would be able to accommodate groups larger than 12 people, and even then only two large groups at a time. the space was so compact that my party was seated very close to another couple, and it was a bit difficult tuning out their conversation (since we were basically sitting at the same table). of course, we were there during prime visiting <span class="highlighted">hours</span> on a friday night - so it might not always get that full. before bar ama, i considered myself the type who can't enjoy whiskey. and then i tried their snake's blood. this was one of the best cocktails i've had in recent memory, and i would come back solely for this drink. beware, the reason i liked it is because it was sweet and flavorful and didn't taste like whiskey!i also enjoyed the tex-mex queso for the table, something like a fancy 3-layer dip for our nachos. i love their family-style section of the menu, although i opted for a lighter jicama salad. their portions in general are very generous; my salad was bright, filling, and the pomegranate was lovely! it was a great choice next to the heavier cheese dip and alcoholic drinks. i'm curious about their mole eggplant and hope to have the courage to try it next time - maybe i need to order a snake's blood or two before ordering food!. overall, this bar may be better-suited for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> visit with a smaller group of people. but still this could be the beginning of a beautiful thing - si el bar ama a steph, tal vez se&aacute; que steph ama al bar!
as a fan of b&auml;co mercat, i wasn't too impressed with bar am&aacute;.with reservations, we were quickly seated by the hostess stand. i'd originally come for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, super nacho <span class="highlighted">hour</span>, but found out through our server that it was only at the bar. the menu is huge, so we spent a good 10-minutes perusing it. eventually, my friends decided they were too indecisive and that i should order for everyone.for drinks, we got two pitchers of beer and for myself, a pineapple ginger non-alcoholic beverage, which was very tasty. between the four of us, we ordered three dishes recommended by our server. she assured us this was enough food for our group. it was not enough.we started off with cauliflower &amp; cilantro pesto ($11), which was my favorite dish of the night. i love cauliflower to begin with, but the sauce was divine. next, we had the pork belly chicharr&oacute;n ($12), which was unmemorable. it was basically two thick slices of pork belly served in a bowl of chile-poblano cream, so it was difficult to split four-ways. lastly, for our main, we went family-style and got am&aacute;'s steak ranchero ($44) off the la familia menu. served with huge pieces of bacon, potato wedges, mushrooms, and one egg, again, it was hard to divide among our group. the steak was cut into strips, so it was easy for everyone to grab their share, but one egg? come on. what are we supposed to do with one egg? otherwise, this was a very good dish. slightly spicy, all the ingredients mixed well together and had abundant flavor. but i'd split this with one other person, not three.the food is good and josef centeno does tex-mex well. with that said, i can't justify paying so much for tex-mex tapas. centeno won me over with b&auml;co mercat, but unfortunately, i'm in no hurry to return to bar am&aacute;.
came here yesterday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. originally i was extremely excited because i had heard so much about this place and their vegan options. my friend and i walked in a little after 5:30 the hostess was on the phone and just ignored us while she was on the phone. i'm sure she was taking reservations but most restaurants i've been to the hostess at least motions or nods to acknowledge you. we decided to head to the bar, big mistake. we waited for a pretty long time for the bartender to even acknowledge us. after over 10 mins of waiting she finally said, i'll be right with you ladies. she sounded kind of annoyed, mind you the place had just opened. there weren't that many people there, so i couldn't understand why it took so long to even be spoken to. when she finally came to take our order we ordered our food and drinks together. our food was served before our drinks. food was delicious! my friend had the super nachos and i had the guacamole. when our drinks were served they were the wrong drinks! after all that waiting she had mixed up our order with the person to the right of us. finally her coworker with the pink hair took over, she was great made our drinks and apologized for the mix up. after we finished our food the pink haired bartender asked me if there was something else she could get us. i told her to hold off on the check until my friend returned from the restroom, she said no problem. seconds later the original bartender we had brought the check over, so she made the decision for us. i guess we won't be ordering anything else.food was good but not worth the poor service to be honest, two appetizers and two cocktails the bill was almost $40. there's plenty of other mexican food spots in los angeles with better service that justify the cost. if i do come again i will not be sitting at the bar.
went there for lunch the other day. staff was nice. we had a margaritas-kind of small but tasty.tried the squash blossom appetizer. it was amazing... kind of small again. 4 bites for $11. i know, amazing food that is labor intensive... still we inhaled $11 in less than 1 minute.we ordered the chile relleno and the mole enchiladas with picadillo added for entrees . they came and my first thought was &quot;oh thats small, didn't know it was a la carte.&quot;it's just two enchiladas and just one chill relleno.i ordered beans and rice on the side which was a good amount with sausage &nbsp;added.i also had to ask for chips which if we had from the beginning might have filled us up a bit. so we were finally good on quantity and happily devouring our food. the flavors are amazing. i just didn't know it was going to be tapas portion entrees.i'm used to the small portions from so many restaurants we go to but this is tex- mex. i'm from austin and have eaten a lot of tex- mex in my life. never left hungry.so i had to try the sopapillas for dessert and was thoroughly let down. there were 3 puffy sopapillas that deflated to a wafer thin honey soaked eh experience. $8 really?they cost nothing. you get a basket of unlimited sopapillas at restaurants in austin. i know we are not there but really? anyway, bill came out to about $80 for lunch and with tip one on the most expensive lunches i've eaten where i left still wishing for more food. i would not go here really hungry again. i would come back but maybe for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or with friends for pitcher of margaritas and tacos. just too expensive for what it was. it wouldn't kill them to give out chips and a side with entrees.tex mex just doesn't work a la carte.
this place was a great find on one of nights wandering around and baco mercat was too packed. the hostess there ended up directing us to here instead and wouldn't you know, it's owned by the same people. &nbsp;it's a small quaint little hole in the wall and is usually quite packed but we got lucky because somebody apparently cancelled a reservation (you'll definitely want to though, this place is not only packed, but delicious!).unfortunately, my review on this will be a little bit biased since i came here after a little bit of drinking and even though my friends got us lost to baco mercat so our walk was a bit longer than i thought, we continued to drink more after we arrived (but i don't think that affected my taste buds any). &nbsp;it was the first time we had ever eaten there so we decided to have our waiter provide us with a few suggestions which were all very good. &nbsp;it's a tapas place here so it's all meant to be shared.we started off with the guacamole which is made to order and served in a stone bowl. it was chunky (the way it should be!) and they were more than <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to refill us on their homemade tortillas whenever we ran out. we also got the fried brussel sprouts which had a very tiny kick to them and wasn't too oily. &nbsp;we also ordered the borracho beans &amp; rice as well as some tacos and it was all very delicious. for a place that advertises tex-mex, i'd probably say this is more of a mexican fusion type bar.if you look at the rest of the menu though, they've got some pretty crazy stuff out there (mondongo? what!? albondigas?? pork belly chicharron!?!?)it is a tad bit pricey and i'm not sure if they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but it's got a little of the hipster feel and still nice enough to bring a date on.
as a longtime resident of echo park and downtown los angeles, in my opinion bar am&aacute;, where i was a regular for nearly two years from the moment it opened, exemplifies an establishment that caters in balanced fashion to both locals and visitors to downtown l.a. living half a block away, i enjoyed my many meals and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals here. the cocktails are phenomenal. the bartenders are cool. some of them make quite the theatre out of shaking their cocktails. the waitstaff are efficient and friendly. they work well as a team.and the food... josef's creations are inventive and daring too. i'm pescatarian, so my favorites are the cilantro-pesto cauliflower, the brussels sprouts, the mol&eacute; egglplant, the puffy tacos (which you can still order but are no longer on the menu -- potato is only $6 and the shrimp is also excellent), the salads, the mol&eacute; enchilada. i'm big on sauces and theirs are varied and well matched to the dishes.their tex mex queso or guacamole with chips satisfy deep cravings. for brunch, try the migas or huevos rancheros. the beans with kielbasa (i have cheated, and it was worth it) are served all day. bar am&aacute; now serves enchiladas vegan style with a housemade cashew cheese. the green chicken &quot;mom's&quot; enchiladas are superb. yummy food all around, lots of healthy and tasty vegetable dishes, and even more for meat eaters. bar am&aacute; is already an l.a. institution. you do have to know the vibe. make a reservation if you are not a regular.

maybe i'm being a little harsh with 3 stars, but i think this place is over-hyped! &nbsp;the food was good but was it 4 or 5 star good? &nbsp;some of the dishes were, but not all, which is why the 3 stars. &nbsp;the service was great though and we got some recommendations from our waiter, which was helpful. &nbsp;we ordered the tex mex queso to start ($9 for what tasted like velveeta cheese with a small side of avocado, sour cream and salsa with tortilla chips), fried brussels sprouts ($11 - for brussels sprouts?!), seared lengua ($15 - this was actually really good) and mom's green enchiladas ($13 - not bad). &nbsp;all the dishes were a bit heavy and even the brussels sprouts didn't give me that light refreshing feeling because of the cheese. &nbsp;i felt like some items were overpriced (the tex mex queso and the brussels sprouts). &nbsp;between two people (we only ordered one drink off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu) our bill came out to about $38/person (this included tax and tip)...pricey if you ask me. &nbsp;this is what happens with all &quot;tapas&quot; places. &nbsp;you have to order double of what you would normally order at a regular restaurant to be satisfied but the prices for each dish are higher or the same as what it would be for an entree dish someplace else. &nbsp;it's hard for me to give tapas places rave reviews unless every dish we ordered was fantastic, which was not the case here. &nbsp;just my pov...sorry.
josef centeno is probably my favorite chef in the downtown la area right now. &nbsp;if i could take this man home-and have him cook all my meals for me- i would. &nbsp;my first time at bar am&aacute; was at the beginning of the summer, about six months after it's opening. located in the historic core of downtown la (a block or two away from the last book store-a must visit), bar am&aacute; is the essence of home style tex-mex cuisine. &nbsp;the layout of the restaurant is small and compact, a bar off to the left, open kitchen in the back and small tables filling the rest of the space in between. &nbsp;the ambiance is casual and hip; dates, families, coworkers, friends-it is great for everyone.bar am&aacute; offers a tex- mex bento lunch box: chips, burrito, and a b&auml;co pop of your choice. &nbsp;it's a great value, very filling, and more importantly a treat for your taste buds. &nbsp;the original b&auml;co pop has flavors reminiscent of ginger, orange, and &nbsp;juniper. &nbsp;it is so refreshingly amazing. another one of my favorites when i am in the mood for something sweeter is the pineapple &amp; canela b&auml;co pop-it is the perfect combination of sweet and spice; it has a great after taste unlike other sweet drinks which can leave your mouth feeling gritty. &nbsp;the chips and salsa are traditional and freshly made. &nbsp;the burrito is large (nothing like the mass that is a chipotle burrito) but not so big that you will be put ito a food coma. &nbsp;it has great flavor and is grilled to be slightly crispy so that it does not fall apart or drip.their take on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is called &nbsp;&quot;super nacho <span class="highlighted">hour</span>&quot;. &nbsp;the menu is served at the bar; service can be a little slow here, but once the food starts coming out, you will not care. &nbsp;the heaping plate of nachos are covered in their house made tex-mex queso which is to die for. &nbsp;another of my go-to dishes on the super nacho <span class="highlighted">hour</span> menu is the green calabacitas taco. &nbsp;it is a very large soft taco filled with shredded green squash, zuchinni, kale, onions cooked in a mild sauce. the puffy taco. &nbsp;there are a few options for the filling, but my favorites are the shrimp and the potato. &nbsp;the shrimp is perfectly de-veined (which is huge pet peeve of mine), topped with a creamy, flavorful sauce, and the usual taco fixins'. &nbsp;the potato puffy taco has nice chunks of fried golden potatoes that are seasoned and also topped with the sauce and fixins'. &nbsp;the shell itself is a little greasy, but it is fried, so it's to be expected. guacamole- made to order to your desirable taste. &nbsp;it's perfect for sharing if you are on a date or with a group. &nbsp; i feel like the portion size has decreased since my first time there, but because bar am&aacute; is a small plate styled restaurant, it makes sense so you have room for their other options.the vegetables served at bar am&aacute; are seasonal. &nbsp;some of the best vegetable dishes i have had here: &nbsp;cauliflower and cilantro pesto, asparagus &amp; crema, spaghetti squash, roasted sweet potato, blistered baby squash (a similar dish is offered at b&auml;co mercat), and the fried brussel sprouts. &nbsp;i never thought to pair cauliflower with pesto, but the two are so harmonious together. the spaghetti squash is &nbsp;served in a medium-sized bowl and looks like orange spaghetti mush, but it tastes incredible. &nbsp;it is a little on the sweeter side, but it has hints of cojita and lime, the yam is more noticeable and there is persillade crumbled on top. &nbsp;the roasted sweet potato is double roasted, cut in half, spread with butter, drizzled with honey and sprinkled with sea salt and tastes like thanksgiving. again, this dish is on the sweeter side, but is balanced by the sea salt.am&aacute;'s favorites are the &quot;main entr&eacute;e&quot; selections. i have tried the mom's green enchiladas, which were way too cheesey for me. &nbsp;if you love cheese though, this is the dish for you. &nbsp;recently he has added a variety of taquitos to the favorites section. &nbsp;i had the corn grit ones not too long ago-amazing. &nbsp; i can't wait to go back and try the other ones offered, such as lobster and duck! &nbsp;my two favorite desserts at bar am&aacute; are the leche quemada pudding and the rice pudding. &nbsp;the leche quemada is so rich and caramelly. &nbsp;centeno turned it into a pudding served on a layer of graham crakers and topped with fennel pollen and crushed almonds-each bite leaves you pining for more. &nbsp;the rice pudding is traditional. it has the perfect amount of cinnamon, caramel and graham cracker; it is so rich and delectable-the perfect way to end your meal if you have enough room left.bar am&aacute; is my place to eat at when i want a delicious, home style cooked meal. &nbsp;centeno does not disappoint and the location is prime. &nbsp;parking has never been an issue, and it is pretty walkable from the city center. bar am&aacute; has something for everyone-vegetarian and meat lovers; so do not pass it up, your stomach will thank you later.
i was so excited to finally try bar ama yesterday, and boy was i disappointed. i don't even know where to begin...all i know is that as much as i wanted to write a review when i got home yesterday, i thought better of it because i was still so bothered about my meal and experience. we met friends there for brunch, and when we got there we were the only ones in the place because our reservation was for shortly after they opened. we got there after our friends, so our waiter may have introduced himself to them, but not to us, so i never got his name. if i had, you would be seeing it a lot in this review even though we rarely saw him in our <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and a half at our table. he was medium height, dark wavy-ish hair, glasses, skinny jeans and a look that let us know he had just gotten out of bed and really didn't want to be there. i asked for a coke, only to learn that they did not have normal soda there, but instead their own brand. he started rattling off flavors, and i kept shaking my head to let him know i didn't want those. he then stopped and asked if he should even continue. so, yeah...that was awesome. i didn't realize the servers were trained to be rude to customers, but whatever. i asked him to continue and ordered the rootbeer chocolate soda which was meh.when we were just about ready to order, we asked what the more popular menu items were, and once again our hipster waiter was too cool for school, and basically told us that everything on the menu was popular. my husband asked about the breakfast tacos and if he could mix and match, to which he was promptly told 'no', with no explanation. so, he asked about another dish, which apparently if you just order it, and don't ask questions, it comes served cold, with hot tortillas to warm the food. so my husband opted for the breakfast potato and egg tacos, and i ordered the huevos rancheros. here is the description of the huevos rancheros on the menu: smoked ham hock, fried eggs, beans. that 's all it says. i didn't think to ask many questions since it seemed self explanatory and our waiter seemed less then <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to answer any type of question.the food takes a long time, so we asked for chips and salsa to which our waiter said ' it's not something we just do, but if asked for we can bring some to you...but we don't have salsa we have a romesco sauce'. just bring us the chips and what was clearly salsa and treat us like we aren't annoying you in your house.so, when our food came, my eggs were clearly sunny side up. so, i asked him why my eggs were cooked that way when the menu said the eggs were fried, and he said 'oh ,they are fried, they are pan fried' . now, there is a huge difference between fried and pan fried eggs, but regardless of that, i told him that i wanted my eggs fried and he said to me again ' they are' and proceeded to walk away not to be seen again for 35 minutes. there was also no mention of cilantro in my meal description and there was a ton...i am one of those 'i hate cilantro people' but since i couldn't seem to find our waiter and no one was coming near our table, i lightly picked at my food. my husband is from texas and was excited for what was supposed to be authentic tex-mex. he did not care for the food in the slightest. his two tacos were filled with cabbage and sour cream and not much egg and potato...and what egg and potato were in there were soggy. he didn't even finish the two tacos that were on his plate.when we finally got our waiter's attention to ask for the check, it was clear as day that i didn't eat my food, however he ignored that completely..didn't ask how any of our meals were...didn't ask if i wanted a box even. just asked if we were ready for the check. i walked out side so i wouldn't yell or make a scene because i am not like that, but i was livid at that point. for such a lauded restaurant, it was one of the worst experiences i have ever had while dining out in los angeles....and that is saying a lot.

great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices with outdoor seating
great spot in dtla with a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu!! &nbsp;also great service.
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals, friendly helpful servers too! awesome view!!!
all of the food was very flavorful and came quickly! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals are great. in the heart of downtown la. will definitely come back.
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! great service, great ambiance and dtla views with amazing drinks.. what else do you need? we only had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food and everything was good.best part is the location. we live across the street so no hassle for parking and drunk driving!
love this place. almost everything i've tried, i loved! next time <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which looks great!
ate dinner at blue cow before a show at the disney concert hall, it is just about 2 blocks away. we were there in time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (score)! between the three of us we ordered mostly just off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu as it is very extensive. but that being said the portions matched the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price, not sure if the portions are bigger when it is not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. if they aren't than hh is the time to go to save some cash. every thing was delish. service was stellar and food came out promptly. drinks and food all made with fresh ingredients. i would go back in a heartbeat.
great food and fun atmosphere. the only thing that lacked was the service. it took us forever to get our waiter, and we missed out on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because of this. luckily, out waiter was nice and was able to change to the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. overall, the food was very tasty! definitely recommend this place!
i love this place! &nbsp;went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with friends after visiting the moca. love the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and food. service was great. and the atmosphere is perfect. we sat outside and watched the sunset.
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;$5 drink specials and delicious food. &nbsp;we ended up ordering everything from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu because the food was so good. &nbsp;must try the duck wings.
chef david is amazingly personable...so is the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special paul's poke ahi tuna
what happened to their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu?! &nbsp;i used to love to come here after work for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for the $5 racer 5 ipa along with the air fries and bahn mi sliders - what a kick ass meal. &nbsp;haven't been here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for a few months and when i came this past friday i noticed that they got rid of the air fries and bahn mi sliders! &nbsp;they were by far the most popular <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items and everything that's left is just mediocre. &nbsp;i heard the people sitting next to us complaining about it too. &nbsp;wtf???i'm pissed enough to go with two stars for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> situation but that said, i still like coming here for lunch. &nbsp;the food is really good and the service is decent too. &nbsp;i almost always go with the kale salad if i want something healthy and the blue cow burger if i don't and both are great. &nbsp;i&quot;d come here for lunch/dinner but unfortunately i'd have to advise against for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. there are better options.
excellent service and food. i had the pork belly sandwich and i have to say it was the best i have had. also, their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices were great for their whiskey wells. i would recommend this place in a heartbeat.
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with excellent service. tried the pork belly tacos, shrimp tacos, and the fries. &nbsp;all were delicious but the pork belly was my favorite. will definitely be back to try more menu items.
super cute spot. perfect for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. we loved all the small plates we had and i ordered a couple of chipotle margaritas that were yummy. server was great too!
whenever i have a meeting in dtla. &nbsp;i love going to the blue cow. &nbsp; and if you make their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> you are in luck. &nbsp;the sangria is my favorite and if u are among friends i recommend to just order everything off of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and share. &nbsp;the pink deviled eggs are a favorite and so are the baked then fried potatoes. &nbsp;it's a great place to meet friends for drinks. &nbsp;the decor is very cool. &nbsp;meet hooks and all
this place is the place to be in downtown! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great and the food is outstanding! i've been coming here for awhile and i've never had a bad experience. they staff is friendly and engaging. the food. the food!!! the flatbread pizza is my favorite!
love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food is from m-f 4:30-6:30 pm. &nbsp;a must get is the duck wings. &nbsp;i repeat, the duck wings. &nbsp;i think they give 6, and there is definitely a good amount of meat on each wing. &nbsp;the meat is so tender; it just falls right off the bone. &nbsp;i'm drooling just thinking about it. &nbsp;as a lover of mendocino farms' pork bell banh mi sandwich, i'm thrilled that the same can be found here. &nbsp;during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, they have them in mini slider form. &nbsp;one thing i would skip is the pink eggs and ham (deviled eggs + bacon). &nbsp;nothing special.as for drinks, they offer $5 beers, $6 wines, and $7 cocktails. &nbsp;they've got a great selection of beer and prices are reasonable even during non-<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> times.
i love the patio at this place . so great to catch <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and then order non <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food. you feel pretty special sitting on the patio and it's a perfect spot for a large meet up after work. the crowd &nbsp;is really uninteresting so it is a must to really like who joins you .
i dropped in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to unwind with a beer. the bar was open, so i grabbed a seat and ordered a beer. the bartender was super nice and let me try some of the beers.lost coast tangerine wheat ($5 - <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>)i ended up with the tangerine wheat. it tastes like a blue moon with the orange infused into it. awesome. i ended up getting 3 of these! if you like blue moon or shock top, i would definitely recommend this.the atmosphere is awesome. you can sit outdoors and enjoy the beautiful skyline or grab an intimate seating inside.
this place has a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! the staff is friendlier than any other restaurants in la and i wasn't disappointed with anything on the menu. great food. great service. great atmosphere.
went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. service was great and friendly! tried the chicken sliders, which were amazing..they looked small but were packed with flavor and actually filling. prices were reasonable...just wish <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> went longer than 6:30!
conveniently located, right by a bunch of offices... great spot to chill during lunch, watch some games, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, etc. the first time i came here was for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. we were seated, but they gave us a time limit because other people made some reservations. we ordered well drinks, beer, and some food. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu still ranges from $4 to over $10. we got the drinks for $4, and they were okay. we got their truffle fries, which weren't really fries at all. they were more of nachos, but instead of chips, they were thick chunks of potatoes. cheesy, veggies, etc. they were okay. we also got some pizzas, they were good, but not great. small <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. i enjoy their main menus more than the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. i tried their korean bbq steak tacos during lunch with some co-workers. the tacos were very beautiful, but for $12 (3 tacos), they weren't that filling. it seems that the korean bbq steak tacos were seasonal because they were replaced with pork belly tacos the next time i was here. those were a bit more flavorful! i also tried their chicken sliders, which was chicken and slaw on bread. i preferred the tacos, but the sandwiches weren't bad. some of the people i were with ordered salads and flat-bread pizzas. they looked very good! i love the salads at mendocino farms, and since this place is related to mendo, i'm sure that they are delicious as well.the environment is great, and it's such a perfect spot to chill to get a small break away from work.
i love the nicoise salad here. i knew the creators of mendocino will deliver in this sit down restaurant. love lunch here and lovely place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
the burger and potatos they have on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menue are crazy good!! it worth the try if you are in downtown looking for tasty burger. good luck finding a parking spot!
wanted a casual place to go with a group in dtla. read the reviews and picked here.parking and finding it is difficult. &nbsp;it is in the california plaza and you can get lucky and street park or park in the plaza on the opposite side of the entrance. &nbsp;outdoor patio is awesome and happening especially at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;we had a group of 6 and they took my reservation and gave us a table inside. &nbsp;hostess tried to seat is outside but nobody was leaving and why would they with the amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials! &nbsp;we got in for 20 minutes left of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.2 deviled eggs for 3$ must do! we ordered 4 and then orders 3 more regular price deviled eggs too. &nbsp;pickled beet dipped eggs with bacon and jalape&ntilde;o...they are divine! ordered 3 orders of the most amazing brussels sprouts and 2 orders of shisito peppers in a heavenly sauce. &nbsp;i had the banh mi that has a sunny side egg on it and is bursting with flavors. &nbsp;burgers, truffle fries, bbq fries and so much more not to mention the beer and cocktail specials. &nbsp;$220 for y of us and the entire table was covered with plates of food and drinks the entire time! service was good but they did drag at times due to the restaurant being so busy.great bar and restaurant!
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work on day. drinks were quite weak and the appetizers were bland and nots good. service was just okay. not coming back.
yummy food, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. interior decor is too notch, creating incredible ambiance and vibes! i recommend the &quot;baked then fried potatoes!&quot;. service is alright, and parking is really annoying, but such is dtla. all in all.. try it!
i like this spot. &nbsp;it's a bit hidden due to it's location inside a business complex but a great location in terms of outdoor dining in downtown la.i think this would be a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot too
i'm so glad my friend recommended this place. it's a great atmosphere; kind of rustic. i suggest sitting outside. the food is awesome &amp; they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! the service is amazing; that's always a plus!
this is for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> onlyi've been wanting to come here for a while but am always deterred by the lack of parking in the area (and i don't feel like taking the bus). luckily it was a holiday when i went so street parking was free.i love the outdoor patio. i'm sure it's a lot busier on a normal day but the ambience was perfect for a relaxing holiday afternoon. i got eagle rock populist ipa while we waited for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (mon-fri 4:30 to 6:30 i believe). once <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> came around , we got the pork belly sliders, baked/fried potatoes, and the fried chicken. the food was great but i'm not so sold on the price. the pork belly sliders were $8 and there were two of them, which means they were $4 a piece. and since they're sliders, they're obviously pretty tiny. the fried chicken also came in slider form and that was good too but for $6 i'm not sure if that was worth it either. the potatoes were $4 and came in long strips. overall, i don't regret it but i don't think i'd be eager to come back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. still need to try lunch.
sat outside on the empty patio where at least two bartenders must have noticed me... not even a greeting. &nbsp;when i realized i was early for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> i asked the waiter that finally greeted me if they could extend <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices as a courtesy... manager said no. &nbsp;kind of surprised since there was no one there. &nbsp;seems like a little customer service could go a long way....street parking is $4/<span class="highlighted">hour</span>.
fun place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! i am rarely downtown, especially for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so it's funny to see all the business people dressed up after work (compared to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on the westside which looks like another day at the beach). my friend and i had reservations, which is a good thing because it was pretty packed. they have a nice outdoor patio, and we had great service. one of our food items took a little long coming out, but after we asked about it, it came out right away. we were kind of in a rush because we were going to a show at the mark taper forum down the street (it's a short walk so i'd recommend this place to someone going to see a show there or at the disney concert hall or the other theaters). the food was good, drink specials were refreshing, and prices were somewhat reasonable. i'd go back if in the area again.
delicious food, good company, a beer or two, outdoor seating, skyscrapers up above, la's early fall evenings, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, great service.... what better scenario and/or vibe could you ask for? say yes to: peaches, burrata, &amp; hambsb's country fried chicken rollor if you're here for hh, just order everything off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu! you know you want to...
blue cow kitchen has a legit <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;all the drinks are great and the food is spectacular! &nbsp;the nachos are delicious and the fried chicken rolls are great -- both are definitely worth getting. &nbsp;blue cow kitchen is definitely one of the better hhs out there and the patio is just such a nice place to hang out!
this wonderful extension and more upscale version of mendocino farms is not to be missed.. it's a great place to get some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or lunch or dinner. we went here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and had the baked then fried potatoes which are pretty yummy... french dip which my friend said was better at dinner.. &nbsp;bsb's country fried rolls which were damn good... and my personal favorite the peaches, burrata and prosciutto which they call ham but it's the best prosciutto i have had since italy.love it.. yay blue cow..
nice place for a drink or light dinner before a concert at disney hall. baked then fried potatoes are so unusual that we just had to order them. good value for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and a great ambiance. we'll be back!
this place is pretty sweet, plus it's literally downstairs from work! &nbsp;great for scheduling impromptu <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, which is how i ended up here in the first place.for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food, it was quite different than the typical <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;best thing for sure are the pitman farm's duck wings. &nbsp;very succulent and easy to chew off the bone, with a spicy glaze that gives it some kick. &nbsp;other solid choices were the baked then fried potatoes, which are more or less glorified steak fries. &nbsp;can't pass judgment on the fried chicken roll or banh mi sliders because i didn't have them.also appreciate that the servers were friendly and that they allowed us to just put tables together on a whim. &nbsp;especially considering i just came in like 15 seconds before.
pretty solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. a great chill outdoor, downtown, afterwork spot. came to meet a girlfriend here and ordered a couple of their wines at $7. we also tried their pink deviled eggs ($3), crispy bbq fingerlings ($4) and their grilled market corn ($4). parking is available in the parking garage on olive street!
opened by the same genius of neighboring sandwich phenom, bck is definitely living up to its hype. come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work to work your way through a sea of blandly dressed business casual dressed folk.their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is pretty good, but i still love their regular menu. their steak is cooked perfectly and comes with a decent portion that won't leave you hungry. the duck wings are so interesting, but it definitely won't fill you up! try their vietnamese salad if you're looking for something lighter but still filling. it's pretty authentic to vietnamese flavor surprisingly!all the waiters and waitresses wear plaid, and the interior is barn-esque. pretty interesting interior design!
came here for a late thursday lunch. fries were thick and piping hot, accompanied by curry ketchup. i ordered the french dip, and it was so delectable that all conversation stopped for a good 5 minutes. my homey got a gigantic burger that he couldn't finish. &nbsp;portions are fatty fatty. waitresses were attentive and hooked me up with extra au jus + horseradish. &nbsp;well drinks, beer, and vino are priced for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starting 2:30pm, but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> bites are not available until 4:30pm. we were surrounded by suits, but the overall atmosphere is relaxed and casual. just remember to get validated so you don't get charged an arm and a leg for parking!
one of my favorite <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> in dtla. the ambiance here is really nice. they have a great outside patio and bar and the interior has a bar too. the place is upscale-casual, but leaning more towards the causal side. the best items on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu are the baked then fried potatoes, pink eggs &amp; ham, and pitman farm's duck wings. the duck wings are a must! as for parking, you might find street if you are lucky or you might have to park in a lot. this place is best to go to before the opera or if you work or live in the area so you can just walk to it.
stopped in for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cocktail on a saturday. we sat at the outside (?) bar and our bartender maria was the best. she was busy but kept our drinks filled. she had everyone at the bar interacting with each other, so rare in la. she was like the host of a party. the cocktails she made from names we made up were very good. we will definitely go again.
i really wanted to love blue cow kitchen. &nbsp;sadly i wasn't too impressed, mainly with the food...maybe i just had high expectations. &nbsp;located in the heart of dtla's financial district and nestled in the california plaza, it's the perfect backdrop for a nice group <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on their outdoor patio or a romantic dinner for two in their main dining room. &nbsp;i ordered the pink eggs and ham...a cutely renamed deviled eggs dish. &nbsp;although very pretty in presentation, the flavors were mediocre and lacking of that comfort element. &nbsp;for my main dish, i ordered the pork belly tacos. &nbsp;i love pork belly like no one's business, but it just didn't come together for me. &nbsp;everything, including, the tortilla was soggy. &nbsp;i want to give it another try...maybe a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> would change my first impression. &nbsp;stay tuned.
i have been to this location 3 times and each time with a large party, blue cow has the best customer service best food best drinks and amazing deals for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they are fast, friendly, clean, accommodating and all around amazing. it's a beautiful location but not pretentious. get there and try it before this secret gets out.
i went here with a group of people and i have to say i love the atmosphere! i wish i was able to be there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but we meet too late. it was a great place to talk to people and it wasn't too loud or quite. i had the kurobuta pork belly banh mi. i thought the pork belly was okay. too much bread for the amount of pork we got. not the best banh mi i have had, despite what everyone has been reviewing. i cannot speak for the other food as i did not try anything else, but i think i would go back and try the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
blue cow was hard to find, but definitely worth the trouble. the restaurant is more like a gastropub. it would be great for <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> if i worked in the dtla area. i would recommend getting the fries, burger, and chicken.they validate 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of parking in the underground structure.
this place is a nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot with great bartenders who are generous on the pours. if you go i recommend sitting outside in the patio area with awesome downtown skyline. take a moment to just look straight up and you get some nice building views in every direction. i have yet to try the food here but this review is for those of you caring to find a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot. great service from beautiful waitresses. very attentive. drinks are $5 wells on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and downtown you cant beat that! now for the management. 5-stars! first, when i arrived and waiting for my drink the manager girl was giving directions to one of the waitresses to clean an outside rail that borders the patio. this is great attention to detail that speaks volumes on a location. second, we had a moment when a homeless person attempted to interrupt our conversation along the rails and ask for money. i didn't even know where the manager came from but before i could turn around he was asking the pan handler to please leave the area. this was a bonus its nice to have eyes on your dining experience. give this place a try you wont regret it!
great after work bar with a really nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food menu. plenty of outdoor seating, music and the standard tvs. haven't had dinner here. if you do choose to come here you must have the rum manhattan, they use a high end rum and its awesome.
house made lemonade mixed with tequila... amazing! they have &nbsp;few good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food specials/options such as the baked then fried potatoes, and the au jus sandwich. we tried the duck &quot;wings&quot; which were the drumstick part of the wing and the fried chicken and slaw sandwich both of which i would not order again. however i will return for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks!
it's ok, but nothing amazing. lots of people seem to go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but the drink menu is very limited. as is the menu. the blistered green beans were pretty good, but i just wasn't impressed with anything.
2.5 stars, blue cow has been on my bookmark list for a long time and i was pretty disappointed, especially knowing they are made by the same company as mendocino farms seems like their menu changes seasonally---casa margarita: tasted great but pretty weak on alcohol for a $12 cocktail---heirloom tomato bruschetta: way too acidic with vinegar---crispy chicken sandwich: the chicken definitely had a nice crispy crust but the slaw was again too vinegary. i also wasn't a fan of the chipotle ketchup for the steak fries they have an outdoor patio in the water court and i guess i need to come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but we couldn't make it before 6:30pm
had the most amazing kale caesar salad for lunch today. the produce was farm fresh and delicious, as promised, and the ambience and service was equally wonderful. additionally, i love the creativity in your offerings. &nbsp;looking forward to many more lunch-<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> visits over the spring and summer.
met a girlfriend here after work during the week. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> crowd and wine menu was good but food wasn't all that impressive. if you come here, try it out for hh and go in with the mind set that you're having a few small bites to hold you over because that is what you'll find here.definitely not the place for amazing cuisine.
every single time i come here, they have outstanding service!!, the drinks are so tasty &amp; the food fantastic! their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (starts at 4:30pm) is so good!! this is by far one of the best restaurants when it comes to food &amp; customer service that i have been in downtown!
i really enjoy the the layout and design of this place. it's really interesting.came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and ordered the pork belly tacos. omg - yes. so good!! i would definitely order it again.my friend got a burger and it was pretty good. the fries are my style so i didn't care for them much. they were thick cut and i like mine shoestring.i'd love to come back and try the fried chicken sliders. i saw them pass by after i finished my tacos and was so sad that i was full. they looked really good!i think this is a good place to come after work!
this place was perfect place for a romantic summer night. outdoor candle lit lounging surrounded by the downtown lights, drinks in hand and yummy appetizers to share.service, ambiance, food concept, specialty drinks. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. what more can you ask for? food we had and i would recommend...duck wingsshort rib poutine (my favorite)pork belly banh mi (his favorite)he had an old fashion to drink. he like it. i ordered a strawberry basil tequila drink. it was missing the two ingredients that sounded perfect with tequila... i expected more hence the removal of a star. i would love to frequent this place more often for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it's so close to the bf's place so i'm determined to make it happen.
we had dinner here last night before a show at disney hall, which was a very convenient walk. we got here early enough for some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks. the food was delicious and our service was great...quick and very friendly!
food is very good. fried chicken sliders are my new favorite, though i miss the turkey meatball pizza and sliders. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> brings good deals too. my only complaint is that service can be slow when it gets busy on fridays. otherwise, good place for sandwiches (and a bit more) and drinks.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food (from 4:40 to 6:30pm m-f)-baked then fried potatoes (5 or 6 pieces) $4-pink eggs &amp; ham -beet marinated deviled eggs with mendocino mustard,double smoked bacon &amp; candied jalapenos (2 halves) $2-bsb's country fried chicken rolls 6-french (onion short rib) dip 8-shrimp summer rolls 8the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal for food isn't all that cheap, it's only about $1 less then their regular menu. everything we ate was good! &nbsp;i especially enjoyed the baked then fried potato, fried chicken roll and the pink egg &amp; ham (aka deviled egg).<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks (from 2:30pm to 6:30pm m-f)beer $5wine $6select cocktails $7i had their version of blue moon (orange hef type beer) and i really liked it. if you like hefeweisen, you might try it. my sister enjoyed her margarita too.the ambiance was awesome! mostly the after work downtown crowd, my favorite!i took the redline (exit pershing square). the place was a bit tricky to find. it's facing grand avenue in between 2 tall building. the address is 350 s. grand but it's not attached to the building with that address on it. it's next to it (on the left) and down the stairs. try to check it out, it's a great place!
i happened upon blue cow during a quick work trip and can't wait to come back! they have great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials! the mango tomato bruschetta was amazing! however, the service is what really sets this place apart. daniel was our very attentive and personable server and the chef, miguel, even stopped by our table. i'll definitely be back the next time i'm in the area!
lunch: &nbsp;food is yummmyy!!! &nbsp; great place to enjoy lunch outdoors in the shade. &nbsp;staff was friendly and accompdating for large group. &nbsp;downside - the chairs outaide are uncomfortable as they r about the same height as the table - cant cross ur lega. &nbsp;but the seating across the table was a confortable leather couch.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: &nbsp;gets very crowded by 5pm so no space to move outside, gotta move in indoors which can get loud. &nbsp;it's really one of the few decent places for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in the dtla financial district grand area.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 2:30pm-6:30pm$5 well cocktails$5 beers$6 wine$7 cocktails- casa margarita: &nbsp;too strong and not that tasty (for me at least).- french (onion short rib) dip sammy was delish... the short ribs melted in my mouth! &nbsp;also had gruyere &amp; roasted mushroom on dolce forno soft roll with hotseradish creme fraiche &amp; caramelized onion au jus. &nbsp;- the seared albacore nicoise was also great - sushi grade albacore with char-grilled green beans, ovendried heirloom cherry tomatos - red romaine &amp; frisee, olive tapande fingerling potatos &amp; hard boiled egg with vinaigrette
this place reminds me of is a more expensive mendocino farms. $15 for a lunch salad? hmm. i'd rather go to mendo and get it for a few dollars cheaper with the same food quality. i'll only eat/drink here if there's a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> amongst co-workers but not really worth the fancy prices to frequent here as a local.
sliders and lemonade are always great. we were seated quickly during a busy friday lunch. they claim to use fresh, pure and local ingredients, too. i've also been during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. good specials and always crowded!
went here with some friends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i thought it was great. great place to hang out especially if you work in the downtown area. &nbsp;tried the pork belly and french dip slider, both were tasty and delicious. &nbsp;also had the jack and coke cocktail and i must say the ratio of the whiskey and soda was just right. &nbsp;the place does get crowded during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but the crowd dies down around 9pm. &nbsp;only problem with this place is parking but there is valet though for $9. &nbsp;still a great place for downtown l.a.
this place was great, i loved the fun, casual but classy atmosphere. &nbsp;the food is good and creative without being weird. &nbsp;we got some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> dishes and regular items. &nbsp;the best dish was the pink eggs and ham, it was the most interesting and delicious combo of ingredients. &nbsp;try that and the french onion dip sandwich, this was really tasty with a crunch in it. &nbsp;we got the tandoori wrap which i thought was just ok, it was a strange fusion between indian and avocado for me. &nbsp;the baked/fried potatoes were pretty good too.overally it's definitely worth trying out. &nbsp;the vibe was so energetic with a very friendly staff. &nbsp;it got crowded with after work people. &nbsp;it was opening night, the staff went out of their way to cater to you which was nice.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> last until 6:30. &nbsp;we had some trouble finding it, it's directly across the cpk/wells fargo center on grand.
very hidden place. came here for friend's bday on a saturday night. got table right away. very good service. food were pretty good. street parking after 8 is free. and i think they have a parking structure which they could validate u. had the sliders and the pork tacos. love the tacos, it was yummy. overall a good place for maybe <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>.
the food here is pretty good, <span class="highlighted">happy hour's</span> solid and omg their potato wedges are fabulous, but service her is lacking. the servers here are really sweet, but they're just not on top of it.
i am one of the biggest fans of mendocino farms. &nbsp;i hiked 5 blocks just to eat their scrumptious sandwiches on a weekly basis because it is the best lunch place.when i heard blue cow kitchen was opening, i was incredibly excited that the mendocino family was opening another restaurant, and i wanted to try their new items asap!i finally got to go to blue cow's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> last week, and i was mildly disappointed :(<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is not meant for a poor student's wallet! &nbsp;when i saw the menu online and saw the popular french dip on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, i was drooling with excitement.but in midst of my drooling, i guess i didn't pay attention to the &quot;mini rolls&quot; description. &nbsp;all i saw at the moment was braised short rib, cave aged gruyere, and roasted mushrooms. &nbsp;i was sold!when the plate came, i just stared at it in my hungry state...what, 2 tiny sliders for $8?! :( no bueno for my poor self and poor student friends.my friend was so hungry he ordered another burger off the regular menu for $14...so he spent $8 sliders, $4 fries, $14 burger...ay caramba! &nbsp;(where is all this spanish coming from...)i got the french (onion short rib) dip, pork belly bahn mi sliders, bsb's country fried chicken rolls, and pink eggs &amp; ham to share with one other friend.surprisingly, my favorite was the chicken rolls! &nbsp;i'd say pass on the deviled eggs, even though i usually love deviled eggs!nonetheless, the service was great! &nbsp;the burger took a while to cook because it was 8-ounces...yes, an 8oz burger! &nbsp;so they gave us complimentary root chips and dip mmm interesting! &nbsp;i will give it another go during normal lunch or dinner <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is limited to only their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, so i will be back to try the other items.tip: park at 350 s. grand parking structure for validated parking whoohoo! &nbsp;tip#2: come here if you want a nice, casual outdoor seating atmosphere!
i really like this place. there's a large outdoor patio which is great. i suggest coming for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (m-f 4:30p-6:30p) baked then fried potatoes-hard to go wrong with fried potatoespink eggs &amp; ham-a really tasty deviled eggpork belly bahn mini sliders-ehh...okbbq chicken flatbread- pretty good
i crown blue cow kitchen my new favorite <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> joint! they have a huge patio area with comfortable seats and tables-i recommend grabbing a table outside. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu-so good! i think my friends and i ordered nearly every item. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cocktails: (i tried 'em all)our favorite: jack and coke's cousin on his dad's side#2 casa margarita gin and housemade tonic and rum manhattan were okfood-wise, the baked then fried potatoes, banh mi sliders, and peaches, burrata and ham were top notch. the service- o m g. we were sitting outside, but our hostess had to re-seat us b/c of a 6:00 reservation. they felt bad about it and brought us a round of tequila shots and free appetizers. how nice of them!judy han, the executive chef, carries major clout in la food circles. you can see her cooking away.
thanks yelp for helping me find a place to eat before a show at the ahmanson last minute. we parked at the theater and it was about a 10 minute walk to the restaurant, very convenient. i called about 45 minute ahead and got a reservation, although im not sure we really needed one. there were a couple tables open outside. we were seated right away when we got there and unfortunately just missed <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so we ordered off the regular menu.the service was great throughout, very friendly and enthusiastic. we had the baked then fried potatos, they were very tasty but i could i have used an extra sour cream dipping sauce, i actually asked for one and they were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to bring us another.my husband ordered the &nbsp;french dip and it was delicious! i kept sneaking bites, it was so good!i ordered that evenings special, a albacore tuna rueben sandwich, dont get me wrong it very good too, but just didnt compare of the decadent french dip.we also got the ooey gooey shortbread cake dessert thing, it was delicious! it tasted liked butter and sugar and all the bad stuff. it was great!the beer selection was not extensive but they had the good stuff. i will say, i ordered a martini and it came in a regular glass, like a old fashioned glass, instead of a martini glass which i thought was a little weird but no biggy.my one suggestion to the restaurant would be to offer the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items on the regular menu. some of those items looked really good and i wanted to try them, but they simply arent available outside of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i would have been <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to pay extra for them outside of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. next time we are in down town area, we are definitely going back!
i actually like this place much better than mendocino farms, which i've always thought was very mehh, both on the pork belly banh mi and on the salad fronts. but opinions may differ bc i did not try a salad nor a sandwich here. instead, i focused mainly on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> offerings, from the fries to both of the tacos (shrimp and pork belly), the pink deviled eggs, the chicken wings, and the brussels sprouts. the wings may have been the weakest at the $9 price point, but everything else was pretty good, esp at $5 below the regular menu price. their margaritas are what i'd recc for a hh drink, as the $5 sangrias and wines were just ok.i wouldn't say this is a must-have in fidi but it's a nice place (considering the ambiance) for hh, esp before a show at one of the theaters.
the food gets 5 stars, but the atmosphere gets 3. it might as well be in the middle of a shopping mall. last time i was there it there was some corporate orientation / <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> there with a bunch of dorks wearing &quot;hi my name is&quot; red name tags. but other than that the food is great.duck wings and pork belly banh mi are just amazing... try them out.
i work in california plaza, the building next door to this wonderful restaurant, and have been here 3 or 4 times already. this is my go-to place for lunch dates with friends and the closest place i can hit with my coworkers for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i would give it 5 stars for service, 5 stars for great tasting food at decent prices, 5 stars for the abundant choice of indoor and outdoor seating, and 5 stars for the chill, yet yuppie crowd that dines here.everything i've had here has been super good. the burger is my favorite! it has a really juicy patty (i always get it medium) and perfectly toasted bun. the french dip sandwich and country fried chicken rolls are also really good. i really like the deliciously soft and subtly sweet hawaiian rolls on the fried chicken rolls. also, the fried chicken inside is really fresh and surprisingly light (as in not overly greasy like kfc). all dishes come with a refreshing salad. i love the dressing they put on it.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink prices are slightly more expensive than other <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> places in downtown (it's $5 for beer and well cocktails, $6 for house wine, $7 for specialty cocktails here), but i'd be <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to come here and pay an extra dollar on a drink for the convenience, service, and atmosphere.
i went to blue cow and i tried the tandoori turkey club and it was simply a delicious american take on indian food. the naan was light and buttery while the turkey was juicy. i would like to check out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sometime.
i love mendocino farms and was looking forward to trying blue cow kitchen. unfortunately, the food was pretty disappointing. we came by for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the items we tried were not that great. the baked and fried potatoes ($4) were really hard and flavorless. the bsb country fried chicken rolls ($6) were not bad. the chicken was warm and crispy and has some cole slaw. the pork belly banh mi ($8) was ok but not great. it was a bit dry. the short rib french dip ($8) was my favorite. they also have complimentary lemonade but it was too sour. this place is located on the floor level of cal plaza. its probably a good spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for people working nearby but not worth the trek here otherwise.
good food, very friendly service, laid back atmosphere. if you come on a weekday (especially around <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>) you'll see lots of douchebags in cheap dress shirts and slacks douching it up outside. but if you come on a weekend, it's a much more mellow experience. added bonus is that they seem to get a good amount of business from people staying at omni hotel. why is that a bonus? because they typically pop in wearing shorts and t-shirts for a quick meal before heading back to their rooms. that means you, too, can show up in sandals and shorts and feel perfectly fine here. dress it up or don't, it just works.
what a great outdoor space this place has! i love (possibly, more than anything) enjoying a glass of wine outdoors in la...and with snacks, can't get much better! &nbsp;they have an excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> selection for both drinks and food.the food here was delicious, the price was right, and the service was on point! &nbsp;the only reason it doesn't get a full 5-stars is for it's awkward/hidden location and no info about parking (which as we all know is outrageous in dtla).note: parking in the garage off 350 s. olive. they validate!
blue cow would be my recommendation for a sit down lunch or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if you're in the area for work or jury duty or whatever. &nbsp;it's right on the dash b line, so super easy to get to, the prices are low for the neighborhood, and the food, a sort of multicultural comfort food with a twist thing, is well executed and tasty. &nbsp;the restaurant overall has a casual, lighthearted feel -- the wine list advertises &quot;approachable wines&quot; -- but since it can get busy for lunch and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, calling ahead is usually a good idea. &nbsp;i mean, you don't need a reservation three weeks in advance or anything, but a call ahead on the morning of is usually a good idea, especially if you know you'll have a group.anyway. &nbsp;the kale caesar, the french onion short rib dip and the pork belly bahn mi sliders are awesome.
best part about this place is the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. especially the old-fashioned on tap.i think blue cow is associated with mendocino farms, but while i like pretty much all of mendo's sandwiches, i don't find blue cow's regular lunch item menus as appealing. it's good food still, and the service is great, too.for lighter fare, i recommend the vietnamese chicken salad.
i came here the other night and i was so impressed with this place. from their friendly staffs to their appetizers, to their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beer selections, to their tasty sandwiches and even their interior, i was just <span class="highlighted">happy</span> that i've found this place. blue cow is located inside the california plaza, and you get to park free for the first 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span> in the building (with validation) so all of that makes it very convenient :) i got the chance to yelp a bit before visiting here so i made sure i had all the good food. my friend and i were very hungry so we went through a whole course meal. we got there exactly at 6:30 (when <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is over) but the waiter was kind enough to let us still order beer in <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. so we started off with a beer for each (friend had the pilsner and i had the racer 5), then went on to our appetizers: baked then fried potatoes and pork belly banh mi, and lastly had the french dip sandwich &nbsp;and the mendo steak sandwich. we wanted to go for dessert but we were so full that we decided to come back again some other time to try out their desserts.all i can say is that, all of their dishes were delicious-except that the french (onion short rib) dip was a little bit salty. i would definitely recommend trying the mendo steak though. :) next time, i'm coming here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and appetizer/dessert menu with the girls.**just a little tip on finding their parking lot: the entry is on olive street underneath this bridge-thing. i went around and around thinking that the entry would be on grand ave.. so don't make the same mistake i did!
in a word, this place is delicious.came here on a thursday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. we came a little earlier to check out the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> before our dinner reservations. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is out on the patio area and is jam packed of the after work crowd, and was definitely 90% men. are working women not into <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>?? good selection of beers on the hh list and we were seated right away at 7 with our reservations.we ordered:- short rib poutine - i don't eat beef so i didn't try this, but it looked very tender- duck wings - these were deliciously spicy with a great dipping sauce!- curried cauliflower - yum! great curry flavor and served with this fat and soft piece of naan- pork belly banh mi - i think this was my favorite thing we ordered! deliciously tender and great flavor!- fried chicken sandwich - pretty good, too much slaw for my taste. i think i would have preferred a better chicken to slaw ratio.- prosciutto and burrata flatbread - pretty good! i always love arugula on flatbreads.- baked then fried potatoes - the table next to us offered us a potato and i thought it was way too crispy- the ommegang white and the racer 5 ipa are also very goodservice is super fast! we put in the order and plates started arriving at our table within 5 minutes! everyone is super nice and they're all dresses in plaid shirts - super adorable. your bill comes clipped to this little black notebook where you can write notes and stuff!parking - its dtla, parking is a nightmare, but i found a street spot on grand right across easily enough. it was just expensive as i expected.note: blue cow is in the water court building right on the grand side. they also validate for parking in the building but i don't know how much that costs.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4:30-6:30) on a friday. &nbsp;boy was it poppin. &nbsp;everyone's here after work.the food and service overall was great. &nbsp;definitely would come here again for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.pork belly banh mini sliders ($8) - braised pork belly, &nbsp;cilantro, cucumber, side of pickled jalapenos on 2 mini rolls. &nbsp;loved this dish, if you are a fan of the banh mi from mendocino farms, get this too! french dip ($8) - braised short rib on 2 mini rolls dipped in caramelized onion au jus. thought nothing of this dish, but it was amazingly delicious.baked then fried potatoes - amazing. perfectly crispy on the outside and had the taste of a baked potato inside. &nbsp;comes with two dipping sauces (ketchupy-bbq &nbsp;and ranch).pitman farm's duck wings ($9) - &nbsp;duck with an aji amarillo glaze, japanese cucumbers with sesame-ginger sauce. &nbsp;it was good but not great. this one i liked the least out of all the dishes.
wow.. you always wonder what mendo's would taste like if they made more than just sandwiches and salads, and they answer with blue cow. no disappointments here.went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was amaaazzzed. alchy prices are very reasonable. for food, the baked then fried potatoes, duck wings, and french dip are to die for. will go back to eat everything!p.s. shout out to yelp for going ipo today! :d
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, it does get quiet crowded seeing as how it's in the middle of downtown la. we had the deviled pink eggs which were delicious! if you love potatos like i do definately get the baked then fried potatos! sooo goood! they're owned by the mendicino farms group so their menu changes due to the seasons and the availability of the produce. parking - structure below with validation i think i still paid $7.
the interior of the place is awesome but during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - from 4:30-6:30 on weekdays - it looks like everyone sits outside. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials aren't a tremendous value - it's still $8 for a couple little banh mi sliders, for instance - but the food is impressive and fun. &nbsp;the baked then fried potatoes were huge, crunchy and addictive, the pink eggs &amp; ham were a quirky and tasty take on deviled eggs (though i could've used more jalapenos personally), the pork belly in the banh mi sliders bursting with flavor and the meat on the duck wings soft enough to tear off with a spoon (if you were so inclined to). &nbsp;our server was fantastic. &nbsp;lots of folks here coming after work for a drink or to wait out traffic. &nbsp;if you're confused about where it is - like my gps apparently was - it's basically on the northwest side of the water garden... the opposite side as angels flight.
i am only reviewing the lack of customer service. &nbsp;arrived here at around 3 sat in the patio, no one greeted us, reviewed the &nbsp;menu and noticed that <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> didn't start until 4, but we were fine with it. &nbsp;we were going to order from the regular menu. &nbsp;we had made our decisions on what we wanted to eat. &nbsp;still no waiter/ress or bartender asked us if we needed help (this was like 6 or 7 minutes later after arrival). i walked up to the bar and asked the bartender if i should place my order there, she said no that our waiter would take our order. &nbsp;waited three more minutes and decided since they didn't want my business, i'd take it elsewhere. &nbsp;glad i did! &nbsp;i'd give their customer service 0 if that was an option!
when i saw blue cow was opening, i was torn. as a big fan of casa, i was sad to see it go...but i also have eaten the best sandwich of my life at mendocino farms, so i was excited to see what a sit-down version would look like. &nbsp;went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, started at the bar then moved to a table. &nbsp;the service was good in both spots and they gladly transferred our bar tab to the table. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu had some really reasonably priced items on it. &nbsp;they have a good selection of plates that either are vegan or can be made vegan with modifications. &nbsp;tried a couple of the veggie starters, the fried chicken sliders, the potatoes and the soup. &nbsp;my favorite was the veggie &quot;chips&quot; and the fried chicken, which was topped with a yummy slaw. &nbsp;i didn't think the butternut squash soup was amazing, but then again i'm kind of a butternut squash soup diva. &nbsp;loved the decor inside and the cute little details, like putting the check in a notebook that other patrons have written messages in. &nbsp;it was super windy and cold on the day i went, so the patio was closed. &nbsp;in the warmer weather, though, it should be really nice to flop into the pillow covered outside benches and enjoy an end-of-the-workday drink! p.s. i love the eat <span class="highlighted">happy</span> sign inside :)
i'm not a banh mi fan, but slap on some pork belly and you have a loyal customer forever! plump and fatty little <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sliders filled me with pure delicious bliss before heading to work! what a great way to start the rest of the night!the baked then fried potatoes sounded interesting so i gave them a try, but they're pretty hard and crispy. i'm not a fan of food that is difficult to chew and eat because i'm a lazy eater and not fun with my braces. quick note: you can't order hh to go, i tried :(
i gotta say, i wasn't all that impressed. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu wasn't too far off the normally-priced items. i would rather get the expensive sando/burger and get me a meal's worth, than expensive samples off their menu. but, to each their own. the price of dranks are only a couple of bucks off, it gets super crowded and they bring in the yupiee crowd. meh. with that being said, the food was actually pretty good.
lunch review: 3/5 stars...because 3 out of five of us liked our sandwiches. pretty expensive for what it is, but i know rent aint cheap up here. &nbsp;been to blue cow for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, definitely better for that!good: country chicken sliders, jidori chicken sandwich, and the burger.not so good: chicken club sandwich and the steak sandwich (dry and hardly any meat).
this place has a really good ambiance and amazing beer. came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so we only got the grilled corn and duck wings, both are a must try, wings were a bit spicy but still very good. i ordered the weihenstephaner (voted world's best beer) and it did not disappoint! the surrounding area is very nice on festive nights, it's located near angel's flight so there's a lot to see. there's parking either inside the lot or on the street (meter parking).
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review:background: i work in cal plaza. i'm a dedicated hh attendee of this location's former self: casa because, to be honest it meets basic criteria of: convenient, reasonable prices, good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> options, lots of young business professionals to&quot; people-watch&quot; and talk with. i was sad to see casa go (despite my nasty yelp review) and curious to see what a &quot;high end sandwich place&quot; could possibly look like considering its sister establishment: &quot;mendocino farms&quot; was already pretty fancy and pricey.food:i had one item. why am i writing a review if i've only had one food item? b/c it was that...damn...good... french (onion short rib) dip. find it on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu for $8. served on slightly grilled kings hawaiian bread, this sandwich is lightly stuffed w/ savory pieces of short rib that shred apart into your mouth like god intended. after one bite i stopped and reveled in the sweet grilled onions, hearty shreds of beef and salty... creamy.... gruyere... all swirling around in my mouth resulting in pure ecstasy. i took another bite and the crunch of the crouton, strategically placed in the center of the sandwich, just overwhelmed my senses and made me giggle with delight. this sandwich is all i need to start a friday off right..their menu seemed so complicated. i was hesitant to try anything with such bold flavors as &quot;mustard pickle slaw&quot; , &quot;sesame ginger&quot; and &quot;candied jalapenos&quot; but as my partner in crime stated, &quot;the real test is in your tastebuds&quot; (or some butchered rendition of that.)... blue cow has passed w/ flying colors.service:the manager there is really great. i'm not his friend. i don't know his name. i honestly mean this as a random patron: he is cognizant of a restaurant's need to deliver customer satisfaction and how to provide it.. we stopped by to &quot;pick up &quot; lunch and found out, sadly, they aren't doing &quot;to-go&quot; lunch just yet. so when my coworker and i came for a little <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> later that day, the bartender told us the first round was on them (because the manager remembered us and wanted to make up for our lunch time disappointment). that is just plain above and beyond.. the place has our loyal patronage already and he knows it. i mean, you've all been there: going to a place you don't love just b/c it's convenient, close to the office, cheap, etc.. so for this guy to go the extra mile to make sure we were treated well was just so wonderful and (sadly) unexpected for an la establishment.overall:i like the blue cow look. the lighter colored walls (the dark brown of casa was a little cave-like). the old leather couch and comfy chairs. the food (i've tried so far) and the comprehensive <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks menu with beer, wine, and at least 4 cocktails that are not to be underestimated. i was a little scared to see my hh staple close and change so dramatically. my fear is absolved and morphed into eager anticipation for what blue cow has to offer. updated review to come, once i get a little more familiar with my new neighbor.
went here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. this place was so hard to find, with all the traffic and weird streets.parked under the deloitte building where it's validated and were seated right away.pink eggs and ham were pretty good- these were just deviled eggs. the fried chicken sliders were also my favorites. the bbq flatbread was a huge disappointment... the bread was soggy and not crispy as it should have been. the shrimp ceviche didn't have that limey kick and i didn't think the chips that came with it were good either. brussel sprouts were also not crispy, although still better than the flatbread. the sangria was really good- fruity and light. what really turned this into two stars was the waitress... i'd ordered the house cabernet off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and fully expected the price to be $5. the bill showed $10, and after further inquiry, she said she'd given me a more expensive wine, and oh, &quot;sorry about that&quot;. not, &quot;sorry, let me adjust your bill for my mistake&quot;. i was here with my manager so i let it pass, but i won't be back.
a great new find! &nbsp;first, the cocktails. the on-tap old fashioned is a bit strong for me but jamie's gin was refreshing and delicious. &nbsp;then my mom and i just shared a bunch of plates since we were there at the tail end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...on our way to a show at the music center. &nbsp;prosciutto and burrata flatbread; small and awesome! the baked then fried potatoes... addicting! kale salad... perfect accompaniment to all the richness. then...the kurobuta pork belly bahn mi sliders....to die for!!!!!! &nbsp;left full but not grossed out.
with the help of my friend, i picked this place for my college reunion spot. me and two guys of the group met up early and had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it was very nice outside on the patio. i'm knocking a star off because they didn't bring us the right order and was very slow in bringing it out. however, the waitress did comp us on a round of drinks and said our food would be right out. that was super nice of her. but it wasn't the right one-- oh well.. it was still very good.when everyone came we go seat in a bigger area. the truffle fries were amazing. honestly everything there was good. but again, our food came out so late.i would definitely go again.tip: park in the ca plaza parking structure. free for two <span class="highlighted">hours</span> with validation!
super cute little place really close to my place downtown. tucked in a corner right offgrand with a great heated outdoor venue for the perfect ambiance city lights with cocktails. my friend and i decided to split two small plates a bowl of soup and a main course and it was perfect! we ordered the brussels sprouts and the roasted cauliflower and they both were great! the cauliflower had a bit of a bite at the end but it was great! we had the cream of tomato soup which was great as well. and for our main course we had the pork belly tacos. let me tell you they were the perfect size and so delicious! i only gave the &nbsp;place four stars because the service could've been a little better. it was bit slow especially since it wasn't super busy. overall great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or dinner under the city lights and stars! can't wait to go back!
checked out this spot for lunch with some of my coworkers and wanted to see what everyone was talking about. &nbsp;i ordered &quot;the burger&quot; and a side of their fries and salad. &nbsp;the burger was juicy and the servings are pretty generous. &nbsp;the fries were baked then deep fried, very tasty. &nbsp;i totally like the atmosphere, location and the decor. &nbsp;will definitely go back and try the other lunch entree or check out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
really cool outdoor seating area complete with heat lamps and cushy patio furniture. &nbsp;i had to soak up all the sun while i could and plopped myself down at the outdoor bar for a quick lunch.the chicken sliders were the bomb! &nbsp;super crunchy outside dressed with a very nice pickle coleslaw on a sweet king's hawaiian roll. &nbsp;yum! &nbsp;i had no trouble polishing off all three sliders and the fresh, healthy portion of salad on the side.service was friendly and quick.looks like they have a pretty popular <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;wish i could partake! &nbsp;next time!
plan-check-kitchen-bar-los-angeles-5
good drinks, mediocre <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> treats.
i floated back for &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and we damn near ordered everything on the menu.they have really, really good food.
been here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> a few times. amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tacos and chicken wings. &nbsp;really quality burgers with meat ground every morning. i'd also recommend the off the menu item the southern fried chicken sandwich for as long as they offer it. the waiter monti is the best! awesome service!
plan check opened next to my work almost a year ago. i was pretty excited to have it so accessible but alas my experience has been mediocre. i've gone here multiple times for lunch and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and all of them have been mediocre. the services is great, the staff is very attentive. the burgers are a little over priced for me personally and they are okay burgers, i still haven't had a mind blowing burger. i feel like the buns get soggy after a while because the patty is so juicy.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is actually pretty disappointing, every time i go i feel like my drink is watered down. the food option in <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price is limited and that's why i don't go here often for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> given the array of choice in dtla with superb food and alcoholic selection which unfortunately plan check doesn't fall under.over all plan check is a decent place and will still comeback but not too often because of the what has been described above.
love plan check!! perfect spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>- good indoor &amp; outdoor seating options. the burger really is as good as they say!! service was great as well, marina took amazing care of me and my dog
great interior and seems like a good spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i went for lunch. sat at the bar and got the salmon kale salad and a side of sweet potato waffle cut fries.
great for a business lunch, great for a date, great for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with friends. the drinks are strong, the food is tasty and the service is fantastic! every single time i'm in here t'quan sets a lasting impression! try the old fashioned on their cocktail menu, so flavorful! favorite thing to eat, the chef special burger with fried egg. bomb.
patio area was cute, but we sat at the bar to be in front of the tv. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was between 4-7 and i had beast fries and grilled cheese, both were tasty. i enjoyed tropical daisy (tequila, jalape&ntilde;o, and mango or blood orange) and smoky suarez (mezcal and other stuff). both also pretty good. it got busy by the end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it was an ok place for a first time visit.
going to be in dtla for the kings game so what better time then to try the new location of plan check. we came in during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so we were able to order array of food and drinks for a nice discounted price. we ordered the beast fries, southern fry chichen sandwich, pickle plate and rockefeller oyster. i could have done without the rockefeller but i usually like to enjoy my oysters raw. in addition, check in on yelp got us free beer nuts. &nbsp;the food was all delicious not to mention the tropical daisy drink on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp; we definitely plan on coming back the next time we're going to a game at staples.
the only good thing is their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;and that's just because the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts at 3! their menu is 75% drinksthey have about 12 options for food. they make their own ketchup. the bleu cheese burger is pretty good. very filling. ordered sweet potato fries on the side. nothing special. parking sucks. &nbsp;try the metered parking in the street or garage parking. not sure if they validate.
this review is strictly for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - mon - fri 4p to 7p dailywe decided to meet a small group of friends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a friday evening post work. based on the reviews of this place and previous visits by our friends, we thought it was a good bet. upon walking in, this place was slammed with patrons. we went to the bar area and found a couple stools near the end. we ordered some beers and wine for the group and for 1 type of beer and 1 type of wine, the bartender seemed pretty lost and struggled with our order. i tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and repeated the order about 3 more times. once we got our first round, there was seriously major spillage of our drinks at the bar. i try and let go of my ocd when possible, but come on dudes, no one likes their wine glasses dripping from a puddle of wine you had issues pouring. by the second round, i was hoping for a smoother order. this time it seemed like it too us forever to get grab the attention of the bartender. not to mention, she disappeared fairly often on us. by this time, i was just annoyed. it shouldn't take this long to get the bartenders attention for another round, even when i'm accounting for the fact that it's busy. while the prices were great for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i don't think waiting so long for a drink outweighs my value of time spent here and the service i get from the bar. maybe this might just be a better sit down type place.
i love their specials!! and they have my new favorite beer on tap, gnomegang--it is amazing it tastes like toffee and is like 11%i would definitely go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because you get $2 off draft beers and discounted snacks. sadly, they only have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> monday-friday. look for street parking around the corner by the medici apartments! i haven't had problems with parking there in the last few times i went :) also, be prepared to spend upwards of $30/person if you plan on getting drinks and fries (it is worth).
great burger (chefs choice)... can't go wrong with the beast fries...the fried chicken was unique but good, not sure if i would order again. the pimento grilled cheese was also very good from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menumonti our server was also great. he tried to make our experience as good as possible.
the old fashioneds are good. &nbsp;there is also a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (which is always good). &nbsp;i had the cruller donuts with ice cream as my dinner because i'm an adult that eats like an unsupervised child. &nbsp;my friend had a burger which she enjoyed. &nbsp;the sweet potato fries we shared and they were good, not amazing but decent. &nbsp;the service was excellent. &nbsp;the atmosphere chill. &nbsp;you can eat at the bar, at tables inside, or sit outside. &nbsp;it's a casual and easygoing atmosphere with good cocktails and very decent food.
i've been back a few times for lunch &amp; <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i'm sticking with my original assessment. &nbsp;parking: &nbsp;valet, metered parking around building, and lots nearby.service: &nbsp;fantastic; servers are friendly here.cocktails: &nbsp;great. &nbsp;i've had moscow mules, red &amp; white wine.menu: &nbsp;small but varied tasty items. &nbsp;i like the spicy tuna salad, light, spicy &amp; refreshing for lunch.i'll continue visiting...
i come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with the coworkers and i love it because of the awesome service by monti! he is pretty much hilarious with swag. the burgers here are chill and they have some good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals like the beast fries aka fries smothered in cheese, caramelized onions and bacon bits! definitely recommend the donut for dessert! it tastes like a churro dipped in custard and lil bit of banana. i feel like a kid when i go here because i get the floats every time! either a root beer float or ginger beer float if you want to mix it up. the yuzu soda is pretty refreshing too! the atmosphere is open and relaxing even though it's in downtown. but i hope you have monti as your server! holla!
one of my peeves is to be seated at a table and have to wait 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge me. i did get to watch three waitresses chat about nothing during this time. it was mid week and during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with the restaurant less than half full. annoying. the only reason that i am giving three stars instead of one is primarily due to their fried chicken sandwich. this was amazing. perfectly fried pieces of chicken, jalape&ntilde;o cheese that melted into the chicken and gave the sandwich a perfect kick of spice and pickles for crunch. although this is not on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, it's definitely on the must try list. &nbsp;the plain french fries are basic and their homemade peach ketchup must be an acquired taste because it's not good. it has an overly fermented fruit and sugar flavor.the parking signs point to the lot attached to the building but what they don't tell you is that the restaurant does not validate and parking is $8. valet is cheaper at $5.
two words: peach ketsup! the sweet potatoe waffle fries would be nothing without it! if you come here see marina she is a great waitress, funny and attentive. make sure you get lucas for that mango tropical daisy during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it had me super tipsy.
$12 plan check burger is the one chosen by la weekly as la's best burger. come taste why. i hate to admit that i agree with one of these lists, but, taste for yourself. decent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> offerings. nice beer list. very good first impression.
fair warning - this is the kinda food that leads to naps so be prepared. that said...the place is nice with an open design that still gives customers their own space. the ambiance is trendy and the clientele is well mixed. dress is a blend of hipster / casual. the service was quick - drink orders and a few apps in the first 10 min. (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $2 off drafts so $5 for a beer is reasonable)food was all good portions - we got a blue burger and their smokey fried chicken + fries (have to order fries separately for $6). everything was hot and fresh do delivery was good. waiter checked in on us a few times every 15 min or so. overall - a good place for some food but unless you are planning on gaining some weight - probably not a regular spot. cheat meal?
my coworkers and i go here pretty often for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. we've probably tried everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, cocktails included. but today, we had the crab dip, plan check burger, and chili fries. in my opinion, the food is pretty small for the price you pay, but still delicious. the crab dip is light and appetizing. i think one of the ingredients they put are those tiny fish eggs you typically see as part of japanese sushi, but it goes well with the crab. the plan check burger was amazing, as always. one of the best burgers i've had so far. lastly, the chili fries are delicious. usually other chili fries would make me feel bloated or sick, but plan check's tasted clean and left me wanting more.oh yeah, marina, our waitress, was really sweet! she was readily available and always had a smile on her face. she was fast at getting us stuff like utensils, water, the bill. great service.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review. 3.5 stars.i was so impressed with plan check on fairfax that i thought i would try this newer location. unfortunately, this place missed the mark for me.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 3-7pm from m-f. draft beer is $2 off and there is a very limited selection of cocktail specials for $6, select wiine is $4 and well spirits are $2 off. a few food specials are also available. it would be nice if they had a larger selection of cocktail specials. the smoky fried chicken sandwich ($9) was pretty small, but it was packed with flavor. the jam and pickled okra added a nice touch of crunch and sweetness with a bit of heat.we ordered an old fashioned and tropical daisy cocktail for $6 each - the old fashioned was strong and well-made.the tropical daisy cocktail was a bit too sweet and weaker compared to fairfax's version. i watched the bartender pour the drink from the shaker, but not all of it, into my glass. shortly after, i saw her pour the remainder of my drink from the shaker into another glass, and she went around the corner and drank it. at first i thought i might have been mistaken, but this happened again with another drink that she made. not too cool to be sneaking some of a patron's drink. note to manager - keep your eyes open.parking- metered right in front
amazing service: great food. i'm just wow right now. every single bite of my fried chicken sandwich was delicious. my husband had the chef special burger with no runny egg and he added jalape&ntilde;os and said it was a very nice burger.our waitress was super nice. we arrived 5 min before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was over so we were able to order the tropical daisy, which is an alcoholic beverage. we also got the beast fries, stuffed mushrooms and the pimento grilled cheese. everything was delicious but the best was hubby's burger and my fried chicken sandwich.for sure if we're in the area we'll be back.
i had the place bookmarked and i don't remember why. came for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. ordered a drink that was not marked as being spicy. it was. in its description it was supposed to have a salted rim. it didn't.the one thing that looked appetizing on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> good menu, i ordered. server came back to tell me that they don't have any. &quot;they didn't make it.&quot;how can servers not be informed that they don't have certain popular items? that's unprofessional. when the server disappeared and i wanted to close out, i went to the bar. she came back and took over the transaction, clearly perturbed. when i didn't receive the appropriate change, she told me she rounded up. &quot;it's a round up l, round down system.&quot;is that legal? i didn't argue because i had a car waiting for me. so instead, i do this the passive-aggressive way and write a review.oh one last thing... the music was atrocious.
this place is so cool! i moved downtown about 2 weeks ago and was checking out restaurants in the area; i've heard of plan check from weho so i went to check this one out. i had crab dip and chef's favorite burger and it was sooo good! burger was delicious, i've asked for medium rare and it was just right. i haven't had a chance to try the pig candy (cause i was just so full) but i'll be going back soon to test the menu out. everyone there was welcoming and pleasant to talk to. our waiter, taylor, was very helpful and on point with recommendations. i'm coming back soon to check out the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
good beer selections + not so great menu = plan check! this place is located on the corner of wilshire and bixel in downtown los angeles... the area where nothing is happening. the only good part about this place is their beer collection. they even have my ultimate favorite, the ballast point sculpin! now to the menu... the food here is overrated! i ordered few appetizers to start with. what a disappointment! the stuffed mushroom was served on a small plate with four pieces. nothing special for $8.50. then the pickles arrived. small dill pickle size was served on a small fancy plate for $3 dollars each. even disneyland's pickles are cheaper than that and it's 10x bigger! for the main dish, i ordered the southern fry. it was very crispy and thick. it would have been better with less flour and more meat. would i come back? yes, only for beer and to watch sports during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. other than that, it is not worth stopping by.
great local restaurant and bar. we ordered the pastrami nosh, spicy fried chicken burger, and fries. both burgers were excellent; however the spicy fried chicken sandwich was the clear winner. would definitely come back to try the other burgers and the sweet potato waffle fries! yummmmmmm! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 3-6 pm during the week and they have a great selection of cocktails. parking is available in both the hospital parking structure next door or in the residential building.
i love this place so much. i pretty much come every other week. i used to frequent the sawtelle and fairfax locations and was so excited when i heard they were opening up a new location a few minutes from my house. i always check the facebook page for the daily specials and swing by when one sounds really great. the spicy chili cheese burger is one of my favorites. it is a teeny bit too spicy for my tastes, so i order it with the regular dashi cheese. another special that's great is the pastrami fries. whenever you have the opportunity to order either, do so.the &quot;pickles&quot; and cheeses are the unsung heroes of the menu. my favorite combination: egg in pickle juice, chorizo sausage w/ green garlic and midnight moon (goats milk gouda). yum, yum, yum. the only thing that bugs me about this place is the fact that some of the best items are offered during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. only during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i live for the wings (especially the honey sriracha variety), but you can only order them m-f from 4-6 (unless the wing is offered as a daily special).
finally had a chance to check out this new spot that opened up down the street from work. &nbsp;not many places in this side of town unless you roll down to 7th and fig. came for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with a few co-workers to catch ncaa games. &nbsp;the food items on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu did not seem that great so we decided to ordered regular items to share. &nbsp;took a look at some pictures on yelp and ordered the smokey fried chicken and pastrami fries. &nbsp;let me tell you, i felt deceived by the portion size from the pictures. &nbsp;i could not help to laugh a bit at first sight. &nbsp;the items arrived in small skillets the size of my fist - $14 for 3 thin chicken breast strips with gravy and yam sauce and pastrami fries with a few cubes of pastrami for $9. &nbsp;the wings for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> looked good. &nbsp;it was $2.50 each. &nbsp;the wings (2 pieces) took forever and was cold. the food was flavorful, but not justified for the price. &nbsp;it seems the burgers are popular, but i tried enough gourmet burgers that i rarely crave. &nbsp;just give me a double-double at in-n-out. &nbsp;the environment felt like some hip, upscale, over priced joint that was not the friendliest. &nbsp;the service was very slow and we were there early when it was empty. &nbsp;my co-workers and i had the impression that they did not want to serve us from the beginning to the end. &nbsp;it was reinforced in the end when a new waitress came to bring us our bill to close us out, while the one that helped us was there waiting on nearby tables. &nbsp;this definitely was a first and very strange. &nbsp;aside from the $6 old fashion (on tap, but pretty good), we could not help feeling a bit ripped off. &nbsp;there was nothing that would entice any of us to come back even though it is the only bar/restaurant by the office. &nbsp;we hit up several other spots after to grab more food and drinks that was relaxed, fun, and less pretentious.
great spot in dtla! plan check serves up elevated american comfort food and craft cocktails in a relaxed yet classy atmosphere. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> has a few standouts including the baked oysters and the pickle plate. the bar is definitely where plan check shines. &nbsp;evan is a consummate professional: friendly, efficient and makes a mean whiskey sour. will definitely be back!
this has become my <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot! evan the bartender is the man! marina has been our server almost every time we come and she never disappoints! this place has a hip vibe that makes you feel very comfortable. its got a great breeze that comes in on hot days. its the only place in dtla/westlake that makes you feel like you're at the beach.
met a colleague for lunch here one afternoon. &nbsp;it's a convivial place for lunch and seems like it would be fun for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or casual dinner. &nbsp;we started with a cheese plate, which was nothing special. &nbsp;moving on... &nbsp;my friend had the southern fry sandwich ($12), which he pronounced delicious. &nbsp;i had the chefs favorite burger ($14). &nbsp;i thought it was a good, not necessarily great burger. &nbsp;a very good beer selection, some interesting indoor/outdoor seating options and fast and friendly service help make this place a solid choice if you're in need of a meeting place downtown. &nbsp;i've also been to the location near me on fairfax and while i found both to be good and interesting, i've not felt a draw to come back. &nbsp;but certainly worth checking out and would probably be fun for groups.
3.5 stars! good food &amp; service, but there was no wow factor. mixed pickle plate ($4): meh. beast fries ($7): meh. chef's favorite burger ($14): delicious. cheese cooked two ways, bacon cooked two ways, + fried egg, what's not to love?! i just wish there was something like onion or a green vegetable in the burger to balance the decadence of everything else. i'il order the truffle mushroom burger next time.smokey fried chicken ($13): good, but not amazing. not worth the price. i'd come back for drankz &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: m-f 3-6pm $2 off draft beer + $6 old fashioned!
the food at this restaurant is really freakin good. we used our free appetizer coupon and got <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beer. we got a milk stout which was vanillaish and light. delishlishy foamy...( only in this context of draft beer). we got the crab dip which has the creamy taste of crab head ( asian people know what i'm talking about, its the best part of the crab).the sfc sandwich (fried jidori chicken) entree was very tasty and cripsy like popeyes on steriods but much more flavorful.im not a dessert guy but the donut here is just ridiculously too good to pass up. hot, crispy with whip cream and bananas. heaven. the servers treat you like a guest in someone's home and not like a customer. great food, impeccable service, and a hip ambiance all encompass for an experience that reminds you that la is one of the best cities to wine and dine in.
tried something new with my friends. it was a very mellow vibe. went on a random tuesday night and it wasn't packed at all.had a good selection of beers and drinks. sad i didn't get to hit up the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4 to 7) but got the sangria. it was a good mixture of wine and fruits, left a refreshing after taste.had a hard decision on choosing foods so i split the kbbq burger and the bleu cheese burger (i didn't get it right the first time so close enough)my server monti was awesome. he's super witty. he was patient since i didn't know what to order until later. thankful for his attentiveness too!need to go back to try some of the appetizers, split bread and dip appetizer. i wished i remember the name, because i wanted more!
this is a cool little spot near the center of downtown la. &nbsp;the interior spaces are nicely designed with an industrial-urban metro feel. &nbsp;the selection of beers is fantastic. &nbsp;if you like beers and ales, i think you will find one or more that suits you. &nbsp;burgers seem to be the popular items along with their tasty fried chicken. &nbsp;the prices are on the higher side but you get good service, a well-stocked bar and a great place to meet up with friends and business associates. &nbsp;there is some free parking in the same building as the restaurant. &nbsp;it is very limited and you will most likely need to find metered street parking ($1 per <span class="highlighted">hour</span>).<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu looked good and the beers were priced very reasonably. &nbsp;enjoy patio dining or comfortable booths inside. &nbsp;plan check is a great place to hang your hat for a while.
checked out this new restaurant and was highly impressed w food, service and timing! charity the bartender was very cognizant of ur drinks which to me is very important! she was helpful w menu items and always taking care of u. as per charity's recommendation, i tried the spicy chicken sandwich w sweet potato fries. it was to die for! very original and savory! oh, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day on sundays during football season! will be coming back very soon!
came here for lunch for an interview i had close by, and i am definitely a fan. it is now my lucky restaurant :)i ordered the burger with bacon and blue cheese and it was really good. the presentation is really nice, they make the burgers look so pretty. one of the interviewers ordered the burger with an egg on it, and it was soooo pretty! the yelper inside of my wanted to take a picture, but it would be inappropriate of me to do at the time! another girl got a salad and it was huge! it seems everyone enjoyed their food. the burger doesn't come with fries, but make sure to order some! the sweet potato fries were great, but the regulars fries are just as good as well. i would definitely come back, but next time during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
went there on opening day because i've enjoyed the plan check cuisine at the other locations. &nbsp;our group shared the beer nuts, smokey fried chicken sandwich, beast fries, and k-bbq burger (unique to the plan check downtown location), along with a s&amp;l old fashion. &nbsp;we finished off the meal with the cruller donut dessert. &nbsp;all were excellent. can't wait to go back.parking in the area is not very easy at dinner or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> since everyone uses this route at rush <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to get on the 110 south.
you know...there's something about a $12 lack luster hamburger that rubs me the wrong way. i was so excited when this location was opening, since i work across the street but i never went back after my first visit. i can't imagine this location doing well, especially with the influx of such great new restaurants in dtla. i had the pc burger (pretty small) and it was mediocre at best. i'd much rather go for an in n out burger instead. the smokey fried chicken entree was better, the chicken was super tender but not enough to sway my vote. i was hoping the cruller donut would save the day but...it didn't. maybe my expectations were too high? or i'm a dessert snob, but i've had better. i'll likely give this place another chance for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but that's it.
came to this gastropub on a friday at 530pm with four friends during the hello kitty hungry hunt 2014 right before it started to get busy so we were seated right away.hands down my fave dish here was the baked crab dip $12.50. &nbsp;i could eat it all day. &nbsp;dynamite sauce, masago, nori, charred tomato, toast, and real crab. &nbsp;if you like baked crab rolls at sushi spots, its like the baked crab part that sits on top of the california roll with the spicy mayo.i split the hello kitty hungry meal with a friend and it was more than enough. &nbsp;the meal came with a cheeseburger with pink cheese, some fries, and a churro/funnel cakeish like dessert that was actually pretty good. &nbsp;the burger itself was a good size and very juicy and flavorful (think umami burger!). &nbsp;my next option to try from the menu would have been the chicken sandwich. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the best! &nbsp;they have these delicious baked oysters that are only available during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and are definitely something to try. &nbsp;comes with katsuobushi (japanese fermented, dried, smoked fish shavings) &nbsp;which was my first time trying it. &nbsp;(first heard about it watching mind of a chef with david chang). $3.50 each but worth it.tropic thunder is a mango cocktail with jalape&ntilde;o! yum.service is friendly, atmosphere is super laid back. parking... well, it's dtla.
tried this place for lunch again - my second time here. &nbsp; i want to like this place - the items are certainly tasty and original, but again today, after spending $17 for a entree, i came away starving. &nbsp; no one came back to fill our waters, and just as bad, had a tough time hearing my friends while we squirmed on the &nbsp;uncomfortable seats. &nbsp;seriously, who designed this bastion of frank lloyd wright's &quot;textile block&quot; epoch meets brutalist architecture? &nbsp;the excessive concrete slabs echoes sound - then add a pumping evening <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> soundtrack for a lunch crowd. &nbsp;plus the busy intersection noise through the open garage doors. &nbsp;the only way to enjoy this place is if you drink. &nbsp;enough. &nbsp;i'll take my hard earned lunch money to someplace that serves a real meal.
this downtown location is actually my least favorite of the plan checks. sawtelle (the original) is number one followed by fairfax, if you were wondering. i reallyyyy love plan check, though. the food at plan check wilshire is still incredibly delicious, but the service was lacking, and that's what bummed me out.for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, plan check offers beast fries for $6.66 (heh heh). i was excited for these because i get to combine my love for cheese fries and satan! they're pretty delicious thick-cut fries topped with melty american cheese, schmaltz onions and bacon spread. so rich. so cheesy.the signature burger at this location is the k-bbq burger ($14). the burger is made with grilled pork belly, the kimchi-cheese hybrid &quot;kimcheese,&quot; gochujang barbeque sauce, sesame salt, fried onions and fresh onions. ah, so good. neither the kimchi nor gochujang flavors were particularly noticeable, but the fried onions and grilled pork belly definitely star in this burger. and it's so good.like i said, the food at this restaurant is really pretty good. unfortunately, the waiters were very brusque, which hurt my experience. the service was quite slow, and the overall atmosphere was made super awkward. it's too bad! the burger and fries were tasty, but i don't feel compelled to ever return again.
i just moved right by this restaurant. checked it out during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was not disappointed. we had the stuffed mushroom, grilled cheese, and chicken tender burger. everything was on point. i think you're only supposed to get hh prices at the bar, but our waiter was awesome and not only let us get the hh menu at our normal table, but helped us get our whole order in before 7pm. normally i don't rave about like the actual taste of the food, but i was blown away that a pretty unassuming place right across the street from me would have such bangin burgers. &quot;plan check&quot; is a weird name though. will be back for sure, looking to try the kbbq burger.
by far the worst service i have ever experienced. asked for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food menu 4 times, a kids menu and never received it, had to hunt down our server every time we needed him, and never received our last round of drinks we ordered. server thought that giving us a &quot;neighborhood discount&quot; of i'm guessing 5% was going to fix our problems. this place is a joke...food wasn't even hot when it came out and it took the &quot;bartender&quot; 10 minutes to pour a beer. or took the server that long to put the order in...who knows. at least he remembered our friends birthday which was the only saving grace.
i'm really <span class="highlighted">happy</span> pc opened up a location downtown only a few blocks from work. i live a few blocks away from the one on fairfax and i'm in love. **bleuprint burger** is life. i swear; the best $13 i've ever spent on a burger. and this is without a side of fries. the combination of smoked blue cheese, pig candy (sweet thick bacon omg i died), fried onions, roasted garlic steak sauce, peppercress is dangerously addicting... and i don't even like burgers like that. we also ordered a side of sweet potato waffle fries. no questions. get em. my friend ordered the chef's fave and if you're really into eggs in your burger you have to order this one. the space is gorgeous. lots of open air, space. i really like the outdoor seating. modern, wood, chalkboard menus on the wall. consistent with the pretty location on fairfax. i'm mostly excited to walk on over after those &quot;fuck my life&quot; work days. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! $4 house red/white wine, $2 off pints. oh and they have tv's (football/basketball game days!). &nbsp;welcome to downtown, plan check. so nice of you to grace us with your presence.
i would describe plan check as contemporary american bar food. &nbsp;it is located in a great space at 1111 wilshire just a little bit west of downtown. &nbsp;the atmosphere of the restaurant is definitely trendy, but homey and casual. &nbsp;we went for the end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a friday evening at about 6:30pm. &nbsp;we sat at the communal table overlooking wilshire. &nbsp;we had a great server by the name of taylor (i believe...or was it tyler). &nbsp;he was very helpful, attentive, and gave great recommendations!the food was probably the best bar food, i have yet to have in los angeles. &nbsp;we started off with an appetizer of the chili cheese fries, and then we shared one chefs favorite burger and one southern fry. &nbsp;they were both delicious, had unique and amazing flavorful tastes in every bite, and just couldn't find a single thing i didn't like.i will definitely return to plan check, as i really cannot put my finger on one single detriment. this was a great start to an awesome evening.
i've been to plan check twice. overall, i'm definitely coming back. it's a great place to grab dinner after work with a couple of friends or even large groups. here's a list of pros and cons based on my past two visits:pros:- i've ordered the plan check burger both times because it's a delicious, juicy and hearty burger. i'm looking forward to tasting the other burgers/sandwiches/dishes.- you shouldn't have a long wait if you get there on an early evening weeknight (except for friday maybe). the staff is friendly and will try their best to accommodate large groups.- they have a great beverage selection and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals.- everything's served in cast iron. am i the only one who thinks this is awesome and makes everything taste better?cons:- street parking (it's downtown la, so no surprise). if you're lucky, you'll find metered street parking (free after 6pm) on wilshire or beaudry.- some of their menu items just aren't worth ordering again. for example, the $3 beer nuts (which i'd expect to be like a free appetizer), the $6.50 veggie chips (hard and stale tasting, although the avocado dip was good), and the dessert which was pretty underwhelming.
this place only opened 7 days ago??i would've never guessed, especially with the smooth way they're handling the suddenly influx of hello kitty fans during the hungry hunt. &nbsp;i'm used to slow service, wrong orders, and other mishaps during opening week of restaurants. hey, shit happens, but not here! &nbsp;the servers and the manager are very attentive and friendly. &nbsp;whenever we asked our serer, connor, for something, he was sweet as can be and always got back to us promptly. &nbsp;my group had the hello kitty bento, which was off menu, but the burger was very delicious! my only feedback would be that the burger and the tuna salad were a tad on the salty side, and the buns could be improved, but the important part - the meat- had great flavor and was nice and juicy. &nbsp;the dessert that came with the bento was amazing too!! some sort of fluffy flaky donut contraption. love it. kudos to plan check for keeping their product consistent despite the rush of getting orders out. &nbsp;will definitely be back to try the regular burgers!p.s. all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sunday during football season!
came in for dinela for lunch/late birthday meal with some coworkers. parking is $8 (not sure how much valet is, but it is available), food was good, service was friendly but the food came out sooo painfully slow! our waitress acknowledged the wait and apologized. it took 45 minutes to get our small griddled corn cake with smoked fish. really??? it wasn't even full/busy when we walked in. as we were waiting, other tables that came in after us and also ordered dinela got their corn cake, fries, and cole slaw in a timely fashion and way before us. our burgers finally came out and eventually our fries and slaw. but one coworker was done with his burger already by the time the fries came out. &nbsp;anyways, the food! i had the chef's favorite burger and really enjoyed it! it's messy but oh so good. fried egg? yum. you may need an extra napkin.the fries were good too, but i didn't care for the sauces. and lastly, i liked the cole slaw a lot. lastly, we were slightly overcharged. not a huge deal. but dinela had iced tea and yuzu included and we were charged for it. unfortunately we didn't realize it till we got back to the office. overall would i come back? meh. if it takes that long for food, probably not. i don't recommend coming here on your lunch break at least. i did notice that they do have online ordering for delivery and pick up, so maybe that would be a better option for those in a rush. we are curious on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but we're not in a rush to come back. 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.
2 stars for the food here but rounded up to 3 stars for the stellar service. i've been to all the plan check locations but this one is by far the most disappointing. the space is really cool - large, wooden frames, hipster-y..so plan check but the food was extremely salty. we ordered: *smokey fried chicken (jidori chicken, smoked milk gravy, yam preserves, spicy pickled okra): perfectly crispy chicken but really salty. loved the spicy pickled okra though! unique. *pastrami fries (pastrami bits, pastrami gravy, melted swiss cheese and chopped pickles) - everything about this was salty, salty, salty! the pastrami gravy as well as the fries themselves. we asked the server for addt'l fries to help balance but that's when we realized that the fries plain were already so salty. no wonder! at the end, the server ended up comping this dish (thank you!) because we didn't enjoy it. *kbbq burger (grilled porky belly, kimcheese, sprouting onion, gochujang bbq sauce, sesame salt, fried onions): i took a bite of this and it's really tasty. very complex for a burger as you taste all the elements in harmonious succession with your last taste being that gochujang bbq sauce. on a higher note, pc has a ridiculously good -lookin' <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (robust food menu &amp; $2 off draft &amp; wells, $4 house wine &amp; $6, old fashioned or tropical daisy. if i can get out one of these days, i will definitely be going.
i really don't think i would ever come back here, unless someone else insisted on it..service: super spotty. i understand it's a lot more casual but the effort with which we had to flag our waiter down to ask for the simplest of things is just not acceptable.food:+k-bbq burger: got this cause i saw so many people recommend it on yelp, but i honestly thought it was just too salty! i liked that the bun had some bread crumbs or something on top because it gave it this unique crispiness, but couldn't taste the &quot;kimcheese&quot; or any korean barbecue-ness at all. overall a disappointment.+cruller donut: supposed to be a churro donut i think? but just ended up tasting like a churro twisted into a donut shape. i thought the whipped cream and bananas were a nice touch, but i was hoping it would come with the vanilla ice cream that i've seen in other pictures! not really anything special to be honest.drinks:+tropical(?) daisy: was not expecting the spicy kick at all which was my fault because it said it was infused with a chili pepper........... but still. was just a weird combination with the mango. so weird that for my next drink (i had to take advantage of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices, nah mean?) i just got a plain well drink. and when your customers are opting to order well drinks over specialty cocktails for hh you know that you're doing something wrong....i don't know, maybe i just came with high expectations, but it seemed like they were trying too hard to push the envelope with the flavors. my burger, 2 drinks, and half dessert came out to be a $40 disappointment.
one word describes this place, weak! &nbsp;not to mention over rated. &nbsp;i tried giving this a second chance after a terrible <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;coming back for a 2nd time was a bad move. &nbsp;fool me twice, shame on me! &nbsp;the waiter we had was either a tad simple minded or smoked prior to coming into work. &nbsp;the most simple request, ie; ketchup was forgotten and once it came out it was spilled on my wife. get it together! &nbsp;the burgers are just mehhh. &nbsp;nothing to write home about nor spend my money on again. &nbsp;there's no reason it should take so long for a waiter to initially come to us nor forget what we just asked for when they only have 3 tables. &nbsp;this is not rocket science. &nbsp;it's not like this place is that popular to begin with on a friday night. &nbsp;if i didn't have a gift card that was given to me i'd be twice as disappointed. &nbsp;$10 to spare on that gift card, someone else can have that. &nbsp;not worth even using 10 free dollars on. &nbsp;best of luck to the next person who goes here.
ok honestly, this place is like, super mega awesome. for the record, i was already pretty drunk when i went (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>), but i don't think that really matters. the restaurant itself is really chic and young -- kind of like an expensive loft and a submarine had a baby that was raised in soho but now lives in la (but not west la). very industrial chic. you'll get that reference when you visit. the food was amazing; very flavorful/fresh/portioned well/presented cute/salty (in a good way)/emotional/drunk food/awesome. i had the chef's burger (eaten without the top bun with a fork and knife, duh), pastrami gravy fries (i know), baked crab dip (to balance out the land meat), and two mango jalapeno margaritas (martinis? unclear about that). it was everything. our waiter was super helpful and by &quot;helpful&quot; i mean &quot;cute&quot; but no for real though, he was actually super helpful (cute). all in all, chic vibes, good burgers, fierce drinks, helpful (cute) staff. biiiyeee xo
updating my review. a day after i wrote my review, i was contacted by the assistant manager, winston. he wrote a very nice message to me and invited me to come back. basically, i was just extremely impressed by his professionalism and his friendliness. he invited me to return at any time &amp; he would have a seat saved for me. he wanted to help me (a dtla local) find something i loved the menu. so...did i?well yes, i did. i returned with my friend &amp; we got to try different drinks + food. the moment we walked in, we were greeted very well. winston guided us to the table he had reserved for us (he even asked me where i wanted to sit in our email chain). i had a bad experience last time with the drinks so winston let me try 3 different drinks. i ended up really liking the nat's hard cider. it was hoppy, not too sweet, and just a really good drink. i highly recommend it. from the snacks/apps portion: 1) beer nuts ($3.00: sweet, salty wasabi) - these were alright. you can pass on them.2) cucumber, kombu, dill pickles ($3.00) - these were quite good! i recommend trying them if you like pickles. they definitely taste different than you're average pickle...but i personally enjoyed trying them.from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu:1) da buck fity wing ($2.50/each - ask your server for more details. these are only available on certain days so call in advance if you want to try one of these) - man these are huge. when you go to a wings place, you probably have to eat 3 wings to get the same fill from plancheck's wing. plancheck is known for their &quot;da buck fifty wing&quot; &amp; i can see why. it is quite delicious. i recommend trying this!from the burger menu:1) bleuprint burger ($13.00: smoked blue cheese, pig candy, fried onions, roasted garlic steak sauce, peppercress) - i feel like i should've tried a different burger. my friend tried it and liked it a lot. i took it home to my sister, and she devoured it. so i recommend getting this is you like having a light blue cheese taste. it definitely isn't too cheesy. last time, i tried the k-bbq burger and the plan check burger and i would say the bleuprint burger is the best out of these three.2) truffle/wine burger - (not a regular menu item) it was a little bit too cheesy.3) fries - average fries. nothing special. ketchup tastes a little strange.i was too full to try a dessert.i am glad i came back because i definitely would say that i will come back now. i have found things on the menu that i enjoy. i am just not a huge fan of burgers in general...so don't take my word for it (the burger portion)pros: great service, good food, lots of options, different than a typical burger joint like counter or umamicons: no free parkingconclusion: definitely stop by here, grab a drink and enjoy a nice meal with some friends! :)
we came here for the hello kitty hunt event, but unfortunately we decided that the cost and meal option offered for the hello kitty pin was not worth it. especially with the fact that we couldn't choose what burger we wanted when all their other burgers sounded so much more amazing. setting:street parking may be hard to find, but there is a public parking lot on the left of the restaurant but it is $8 for parking.upscale and modern restaurant. lots of windows and natural lighting. lots of tables and benches. i just dislike how tiny the tables are, but at least the food isn't served on giant plates that barely fit. they do have a really nice bar as well.service:our server jj was very nice and conversated with us about the event going on and gave us pointers on the food. it was very awesome of him to offer us the hello kitty green tea lattes because we chose not to get the exclusive meal deal. we also had multiple servers refilling out waters and asking if everything was good.everyone seemed clean cut and professional.food:(<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 3pm - 6pm)da buck fity wing $1.50 each- buffalo flavored whole wings (you get the whole arm!)these were served hot. i don't usually like buffalo sauce because most of the time they have too much vinegar which makes them tangy, but it was light and perfect here. it was a great appetizer.beast fries $6.66- schmaltz onions, bacon spread, and americanized cheesethese tasted like beer cheese fries. i didn't like the cheese too much but i did like the flavors from the bacon spread. this dish was quite small. it was ok.truffle mushroom swiss burger $14portabello mushrooms with truffle oil and veggiesthis definitely has to be one of the best burgers i have ever had in my whole life. its quite a simple burger but was melting in my mouth with every bite. the truffle flavorings was so subtle, tasting almost like a garlicky goodness. the burger buns here are also very unique. they are light and covered in a type of grain. all i can really say is, you must try this burger!!korean bbq burger $14add fried egg $2- grilled pork belly, kimcheese, sprouting onion, gochujang bbq sauce, peppercressthis was another great burger! the bbq sauce was sweet. the grilled pork belly was juicy and savory. the patty is cooked to perfection. not too dry and not too undercooked. it was just juicy. everything just went so well together.hello kitty green tea lattethese came in cute plastic cups. green tea on the bottom, whipped cream on top with green tea hello kitty shaped powder. the tea wasn't exactly sweet. it just tasted like a milky green tea. the powder is a bit bitter if you taste it by itself. but its decent when you mix everything together.overall, i would definitely come back here again!it just kind of sucks that none of their burgers or sandwiches come with a side of fries. all sides are sold as an a la carte. the burgers are on the smaller side as well, but you definitely get your moneys worth in quality and flavor.

it's funny how this location always changes.i liked parish, and was sad to see them gone.only had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and snacks.(great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>)sat outside downstairs.drinks and bar were great. easy.would go back for sure.
small patio area, good service.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 2 for 1 well drinks (so $8) which lasts until 6 on fridays at least.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beer special is $4 and light and fruity.tried the fried corn balls which were yummy but nothing special.
came in on a sunday afternoon for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with some of my girlfriends. they seem to have a good variety of cocktails, beers on tap, and house wine for around $5-$10.i opted for a peach bellini which was a little too sweet but overall delicious. we also ordered their $1 oysters but these were not worth it...i actually had to send a couple back because they looked a little suspicious and not too good to eat.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> area is small and can fill up quickly so come early if you want to sit at a table!
i went to preux and proper for some alone time a couple days ago.my plan was to have one drink and leave but then i found out it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (daily from 4-6pm). so naturally, i ordered like a thousand more cocktails and got completely sh*tfaced. funny thing was that none of the drinks i ordered were on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. haha i fail at life. it's okay though. the food i ordered were part of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so i did get some kind of deal. $1 oysters and these delicious shrimp beignets for like $10 or $12? i can't remember. their cocktail &quot;the westside&quot; is very refreshing. if steven/stephen is working, ask him to make you a vieux carre. he makes a good one.if you decide to get one of those slushie cocktails, you can add a shot for only $3 which is a steal. i recommend the strawberry flavored one.oh their old fashioned is also pretty good too.i also had something similar to a whiskey sour but with a slight twist to it and i remember that being really good too.i would go on but i semi blacked out on and off throughout the night so i can't remember what else i had.
p&amp;p has the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! all my favorites from the dinner menu are listed between $6-$10 dollars on the hh menu. order the entire <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and you will be in heaven. 2 for 1 cocktails on non specialty cocktails from 4-6pm ;)the staff here was super friendly and its a great spot to people watch. great food, great drinks, great place, and a grrrrreeat experience.
i have visited this place a few times with a group of people each time. i must say they have something special. the food is good, waiting staff is excellent and the price is worth the experience. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is good, however they don't offer discounts on drinks. the only reason they don't get a 5 star rating is because they do not offer late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink specials.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;our bartender was great! &nbsp;food was excellent and our drinks were fantastic. &nbsp;will definitely be back!ask the bartender to give you taste samples of the slushee cocktails. &nbsp;so yummy!!
great vibe. good music. it's an adorable date spot. good at any time of day. burger was good. they don't have a lot of sauce options but their fries are good. try to come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for great pricing and good variety of food.
i really enjoyed the drinks and the bartender was great but i could have done without the fig jam in my burger. not a bad spot to hang out though. shufflepuck table and great outdoor seating. perfect for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> people watching.
my friend and i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and luckily, we snagged a spot on the street...but whoa the meters are expensive. it might almost be cheaper if you can find a flat rate parking lot so you don't have to rush back to your car and pay almost $4 for 40 minutes. then again, the location is typical of dtla where it's impossible to park at any <span class="highlighted">hour</span>...if anything, try ubering here (haha). with that being said, the drunken watermelon is by far the best cocktail i've had in a while! i'd gladly pay the $13-14 for it again and i'd highly suggest it if you like strong drinks that don't taste strong. although there was moonshine in it, it tasted just like watermelon and lime juice...yum! the pork belly bites were also delicious and $7 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! prices here are a little bit steep, but it's a cute place to drop by and kill some time.
delicious and foofoo can be served at one restaurant! &nbsp;one of my best friends decided to have a birthday party <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here. lo and behold... who knew that los angeles had a dine la <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu?!this was my first time at this place. how could i not have known it was here? cajun creole is my favorite type of food! i will definitely come again, even though i'm taking off 1 whole star for the extremely slow service. i can not over state how extremely slow send me in. yet i'm only taking off one star... great food and ambience.there were about 20 of us, so we had everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. we all enjoyed everything! they better pay that chef extra to keep him there. shrimp beignets, exquisite! corn fritters, delicious. pork belly wraps, delicious. oysters on the half shell, delicious. the fries, when not too hot, good. the burger, excellent. et cetera.
yummy cocktail drinks with 90's hip-hop blasting on a friday night made a very good impression on my first visit here. there is a full bar upstairs and downstairs and for a friday night it wasn't too crowded. vibe here is chill with cute new orleans-esque decor. open windows upstairs make the room breezy and comfortable. i would love to come back and try their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food.
tried this place on wednesday before thanksgiving for gno. someone at work recommended this place <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but we ended up missing it. we showed up too late...first of all, the bar area was wide open, so it was so cold everywhere. we couldn't find a warmer place since both inside and outside were freezing. no heater, really?!food was ridiculously overpriced, which is understandable for some bars in that area. but portion was just little too ridiculous. ordered shrimp beignet and some specialty fries. they both had medicate flavor/taste, and just ridiculously small portions for their price.tried slushy cocktails, which were very watered down. and they were just bad ideas since it was so cold inside. also cocktail price was just ridiculous as well for what it's worth...i went there since someone recommended, but i was very disappointed...
came here for brunch on a sunday afternoon. the restaurant even has a bourbon st feel to it with the open doors/windows throughout. the staff is very friendly and helpful. &nbsp;the food was great...i had the fried chicken and pancakes and fried eggs. &nbsp;the drinks were really good - i tried the ginger and the mango mimosas.they even have a live bands, two bars...one upstairs and one downstairs.the only downside for me was that the mimosas weren't bottomless. but u believe they have a sunday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that starts at 4pm. overall great place!
3.5 stars for me.after our class about 10 of us went to preux &amp; proper for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;we arrived around 5:00pm and had a table reserved outside. &nbsp;we ordered appetizers and drinks. &nbsp;i was kind of surprised that the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks consisted only of 2-for-1 well drinks and $4 abita beers. &nbsp;i'm not sure if the appetizers were discounted or not. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 4 to 6pm, so it ends fairly early.the outdoor seating area is nice, but there's a street on both sides of the bar, so it's a bit noisy and you may breathe in car exhaust.the decorations were nice. &nbsp;all the seating were high stools and high tables. &nbsp;i heard from friends that the frozen drinks were very good. &nbsp;they have one super large one that costs $45.00.the one negative was for being a relatively small bar/lounge the service could be much better. &nbsp;there were many times when our server was at our table delivering drinks or food and the person right next to him (including me one time) would ask if they could order a drink and he would say, just a minute, then leave our table and come back like 10 minutes later. &nbsp;this probably happened about 4 to 5 times in our several <span class="highlighted">hours</span> at preux &amp; proper. &nbsp;the food was good, but not exactly my preferred cuisine, but i didn't take any stars off for that (only the service or lack thereof). &nbsp;other people in our group felt the same way.xie xie!
absolutely loved this new spot. &nbsp;came here on a thursday night. it's got a cool euro-yet down home vibe. there's lots of windows. &nbsp;we had the smoked shrimp beignets, some sort of chicken paella rice jam and kale. everything was uber flavorful. great drinks.service was good although a tad slow at times-but our server was super sweet. will definitely be back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and all the other <span class="highlighted">hours</span> for that matter. and i can't wait until they start doing brunch!
actually got referred here by another bartender on friday night. sooo <span class="highlighted">happy</span> we followed through with the recommendation. pretty much winged the night and ended up here around 11pm (late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>). great vibe. great location. ordered drinks downstairs (forgot the guy's name) and then later on we ordered oysters and the beignets. food was okay. but the location, music and upstairs patio sold me. i've visited nola so i had something to compare it to. this place had a unique and different feel to it in comparison to other spots in downtown la and for that reason i would recommend it to others. check it out!
had a great night at preux &amp; proper on june 16th. sat at the bar and was looked after by stephen as very knowledgable and fun guy who can mix some serious cocktails. the live music that came in later was a treat (apperantly a regular tuesday night thing) as was the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that kicked in at 11pm! the food was fantastic, brilliantly put together. a great place with a great vibe, look forward to returning when i'm in la again.
decided to try this since they were participating in the dine la <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> week and i've had this place bookmarked since they first opened. amongst walking in, the bar was packed with people. it's a bit small but there's plenty of seats. the upstairs section was sectioned off because they had already reached room capacity. bummer :( i didn't get to try any of the food other than the fries, which were pretty good. the fries were really thick cut potatoes sooo if you're a fan of thick cut french fries you would enjoy it! i've seen the food they brought out to the other customers and it looked so good.. so i'm definitely going to have to come back some other time to try their food!! the staff gave me and my party on the house samples of their many fruity flavored daiquiris, which were ahhh-mayy-zing! it brought me back to the good times with fat tuesday in las vegas. my favorite daiquiri was the pina colada and strawberry mixed together; it was priced at $10 a cup. &nbsp;they had one with a banana flavor and surprisingly that was really good as well! i'll definitely be coming back during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to try more flavor combos.
this place has great drinks, terrible dinner food. very limited fake fancy menu. great place to come and watch the game with friends at the bar. like i said great drinks. they have the alcohol slushed machines with some of the same flavored as wet willies in south beach. &nbsp;i come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks but not if i'm legitimately hungry for a really yummy dinner. the punch bowls are super amazing. blackberry and watermelon are my favorite, it says it's for 3-4 people but they pack so much ice &nbsp;into the bowl i'd say it's just for 1-2 people at most.
i've lived in downtown la for almost 3 years now and preux and proper is a very welcome addition. the food is excellent and the cocktails also fall under that category. my latest visit was for a date on a saturday night and the place was very lively with it's own dj. i'm not sure when the dj comes on, i arrived late (9:15/30) so the music was very loud when dining but that didn't take away from the dining experience. however, if you are looking for something a little quieter then best to arrive earlier or choose another location.shuffleboard is also a prominent part of the downstairs part of the restaurant/bar, which makes for a much more enjoyable <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>(s). there are also outdoor areas to make perfect use of the wonderful weather la has to offer.
love the food and drinks! super chill and good vibe in there, great music and location. the staff seems to love working there and having fun, cosmo has to be my favorite bartender! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great, i've tried the frog legs, oyster po boy, shrimp, and fries all yummy and with a nice spicy kick! careful with the drinks, they're a little too tasty :)
this place has a lot of potential. love the location.. its in the corner of a fork in the road, reminded me of a bar in new york or chicago, when we walked up. drinks were really good anddd they have moonshine. hah! they had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a friday night which is pretty cool, but we didn't get any food. it was a bit on the empty side but i think it's because it has just opened. but love the simple southern decor &amp; ambiance.
i really wanted to love this place, especially since i was really excited to come here for dine la <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> week. but i left semi-satisfied, freezing cold, and a burning hole in my pocket for what is supposed to be &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; prices. the portions are super small, the food is meh, and of course, all largely overpriced. shrimp beignets were okay. mostly dough with bits of shrimp, if you could find any. lobster roll'boy was loaded with mayo and celery, almost like a tuna salad. i really wanted to like it, but i couldn't get over how much mayo they put. couldn't really taste the lobster. the pickled veggies that came with it, on the other hand, were a nice contrast.oysters on the half were super disappointing. 6 of the smallest oysters i've ever seen for $16? i'm such an oyster lover, but even the fanny bay oysters couldn't win me over.although there was a live jazz band playing, it was just too loud for anyone to socialize. scanning the room, it didn't seem like anyone was having fun, mostly because all you could do was sit there. granted that we came for late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at 11 pm, it was a pretty chilly nite. but i just don't understand why they would leave all the windows open and still turn the ac on. the draft is a killer if you're not expecting it. after receiving the bill, me and my boyfriend were offered two mini-sized mason jars for free daquiri tasting at the bar before we left. my favorite was the mint julep - it was so refreshing and yummy.tl;dr - super small portions, overpriced, mediocre meal, could've gotten better food at a food truck...
preux &amp; proper is located right where spring and main converge (across from verve) and serves new orleans inspired cuisine. the dining room is very open and airy with windows on all sides and patio seating with a nice view of the cityscape. i ordered the fried chicken po'boy, which was easily one of the best chicken sandwiches i've ever had. the bread was soft, yet firm. the chicken was crispy and juicy. the condiments added a nice spicy kick. the sandwich came with a small side of chips. my friend ordered the salt roasted pork lion and was equally impressed. will definitely be back for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
my new favorite <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! 4-6pm, even on the weekends. the delicious food is almost half off and the drinks (not specialty cocktails) are buy one get one free. the bartenders and service staff are great as well. i've tried almost everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. the fried oyster po'boy, the smoked shrimp beignets, and the frog legs are a must! i thought the crab cake was just okay (but i'm a crab cake snob, no one can touch maryland crab cakes), but my friend enjoyed it. my friend also really liked the belly bites. the deviled eggs are also good. now for the wings, they were too small for my taste and the jerk flavor was aggressive, so i wouldn't order them again, since there are so many other dishes that i loved. the specialty cocktails are tasty, louisiana lemonade, yum! the frozen drinks are good but if you're looking to get a little buzz, it's not going to happen with those. the moonshine, yes moonshine, is worth a try but i'm much more interested in a tasty cocktail.i hope preux and proper makes it, unfortunately this corner seems to be cursed. it's been 3 different restaurants in less than 5 years. this one is my favorite!
i went two nights in a row, once for dinner to get a feel for the place, and then again to try <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i saw the same friends of the bartender both nights. it made me reluctant to sit at the bar the next night.the first night the place was still packed from <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. there was a general air of merriment. you could hear people cheering through the open windows from the street like there was a game on. <span class="highlighted">happy</span> drunks who must have wanted jobs there both greeted us and wished us a good night when we left. upstairs it was the same vibe. there was some kind of event or party, because they were all taking pictures of each other and giving toasts. it is a good place for groups. the table configuration lends to it. there is a patio upstairs, and if no one is eating nearby, you can smoke and drink there. i saw a lot of folks getting the punch bowl of booze for 4.i didn't try any of the specialty cocktails, which were frankly boring. but i did have an excellent california chardonnay with my meal of a half dozen oysters, the steam pot and sides of cauliflower and greens.the west coast oysters from washington needed a lot of sauce. they tasted fine, but they didn't seem very fresh. the cauliflower was adequate, but still forgettable. i liked the greens with the steam pot. they were salty and spicy, reminding me of how my friend's mom on long island makes them to eat with the clams her dad would catch on the weekend.the steam pot we'll get into with the service, which could use some improvement. we sat down and a waitress came over. it seems they have a rehearsed spiel that they have been trained to deliver to you.she went through it, went away, and then another guy wandered over, introduced himself and launched into the same speech. the hostess came over and grabbed him like a first grade teacher in a pageant with the little boy who can't wait to deliver his line. he looked upset and embarrassed and was sulky the rest of the night when he ran food to our table.we asked the server what was in the steam pot. she said it had lobster, shrimp, crab and sausage. that sounded wonderful, but there was no lobster and no apology. there were two kinds of sausage (andouille and kielbasa) thrown in to make up for the missing lobster. our steam pot was three head on prawns, two little corn cobs, some potatoes and soup vegetables and a hunk of crab without the claw.when we declined dessert, she brought us two little jars and explained they were traditional lagniappes that we could take to the bartender downstairs to be filled with the frozen drink of our choice. i had the rum runner, and my husband had the rocket fuel. that was when we &quot;met&quot; the bartender's friends. they were there the next day right on the corner of the bar by the front door. the two seats between them and the door were the only ones left at the bar. we tried to run upstairs, but it was roped off. the bartender explained they don't open it until 6pm. it wasn't horrible, just awkward being forced by proximity into their conversation, shit-talking mutual acquaintances, and loudly i might add, or watching coverage of the boston marathon bombing on espn. it was definitely a less lively mood that day.they noticed the look of horror on my face and others' and changed the channel finally. &quot;how did that get on there?&quot; i mumbled, &quot;i guess it's sports.&quot;there are two <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, an early and a late one. only the early one has drink specials, dollar off beer and 2-for-1 well drinks, no cocktails. then there is a reduced price <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food menu. we had the corn fritters with jalape&ntilde;o and the pork belly bites. i was hoping the corn fritters would be the brilliant love child of hush puppies and jalape&ntilde;o poppers, but they were just corn fritters. the menu description implied they could be more, especially with creme fraiche included. it must have been in the batter.the pork belly bites were good, nicely fried with a spicy maple sauce and served in lettuce leaves. i think <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is going to be the ticket until they work out some kinks in the kitchen and service, and because the late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 11pm-1am, it's a good choice for a cheap late night bite before bed. cute date spot, too.
this place is just awesome, drinks, staff and food are all amazing. yesterday i ate the best big gourmet burger and with fresh big rustic hand made french fries i have had in awhile, all for just $12. who knew <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is on here every sunday..... a gem thanks folks at p&amp;p. hope to return very soon.
ambience is so perfect! sit upstairs in the balcony and it's easy to imagine you aren't in la. we showed up for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 11-1pm just on accident and ended up very surprised on the find. we had:- froglegs: one of the best in la. very moist, lightly pan fried and very well seasoned. with bits of their okra salad mixed in. - corn fritters: fried up balls of goodness- belly wraps: pork belly on lettuce. like candied bacon. - lobster roll: nice touch with the avocado and hot sauce on top. one of the best ones i've had. came with pickles that definitely tasted housemade. parking is pretty easy on the street (on a fri late night) and tables were available inside and out. service is prompt and attentive. not sure about the regular dinner menu prices, but i was quite <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with the whole experience. walking distance to golden gopher is a plus.
finally came here to try the food! short update:oyster po boy- the batter is a little lighter and thinner than the ones at new orleans, but it was a delicious sandwich. love the sauce that went with it!shrimp beignets- as yummy as they say. kind of like a shrimp pancake but deep fried. with the same awesome sauce. favorite dish of the night. steam pot- great light broth with corn and onions. also has sausages, andouille sausage, and shrimp. my friend's favorite part was the sausage. dip the toast in the soup, put the toppings on top, and you've got yourself a winner. frog legs- also the same light batter, very flavorful, a little tougher than regular meat but it is frog legs. yum.mnus one star for the service. the bartender didn't really know what he was doing, and put our order in wrong until we corrected him. the drunken watermelon punch he was unable to make accurately, and the other guy had to help him out. so much ice in the punch; it's supposed to server 4-6, but the two of us finished it no problem. we also couldn't order corn fritters because it wasn't <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> yet? not sure what he was saying but damn. i rather come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! the other bartender was super nice though, gave us samples on the drinks and whatnot. other than that, still a great new restaurant with a ton of potential!
recently came here last week for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with my girlfriends &amp; i was excited because i had come for the first time the weekend before &amp; had a good time. seating: well this time around it was crowded of course because it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but wish the seating was better. they have two levels downstairs they have a outdoor patio with a huge communal style eating table that was full when i came. they also have maybe two tables that fit four people also full that day and the other options are bar style tables for two, which was not the best for our party of five but we pulled some seats up &amp; toughed it out. drinks: they appear to have a nearly full bar, but me &amp; my friend came for the daiquiris. the first time i came they let us sample the daiquiris, as this place is new orleans themed... food, decor &amp; drinks. however, this time around this new bartender wasn't as friendly but i ended up getting the pi&ntilde;a colada. among that they have mint julep, mango margarita, rocket fuel &amp; some coffee chocolate one wasn't the best to me. beware of the rocket fuel like the bartender stated its like college in a cup. it has everclear which is also a nola known liquor similar to moonshine &amp; super potent. if you wanna have a good time though go for it but pace yourself. upstairs: after our drinks we wanted to explore upstairs &amp; get some food but was told it didn't open til 6 which was when <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended. odd if you come with a big group &amp; small bar style table &amp; chairs are not big enough to hold meals. we just drank our drinks &amp; headed up after 6pm. once upstairs i can say i was impressed it was a nice size, cool decor &amp; even had a fresh oyster ala carte section. food: the food was mediocre. my friends ordered fried oyster poboy, brisket poboy, shrimp beignets &amp; fried frog legs. they said their meals were just okay but the frog legs were pretty good taste like chicken lol. i got the steak &amp; fries but when my food arrived it looked more like slivers of meat precut on a bed of fries i wasn't impressed for $20 so i returned &amp; got the preux burger which was actually pretty good. service: the waiter who took our food order was nice, checked on us &amp; was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to replace my order. my second order came out pretty slow but guess it to be expected. i would probably come back for drinks as i work downtown, but not a top pick. btw, it's downtown so find street parking or there is a lot for $8 across the street.
read all the reviews and chef john, my cuisine journal buddy can't resist southern cuisine and has a tender spot for n'awlins. &nbsp;everyone's gone by the crossroads of this place and thought many times, &quot;what the heck! &nbsp;that place looks great!&quot; and on a thursday a few months back, we went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;as previous yelpers have said it's an interesting mix. &nbsp;first impression: &nbsp;big bar edged by round stools to the left with a &nbsp;friendly bartender that gives a big wave. &nbsp;to the right - hightops with stools and a darling patio beyond. &nbsp;we stood just inside getting our bearings. &nbsp;staff hustled past us as water rushes by big boulders. &nbsp; no hostess to seat. &nbsp;looked at the bartender - &nbsp;&quot;sure, seat yourselves anywhere.&quot; &nbsp; second impression: &nbsp;walked upstairs with a service dog in arms. &nbsp;8 pounds. while looking around and feeling amazingly like we were on the upper deck of a double decker bus in london and loving the outdoor open ambiance on a gorgeous la evening, the hostess hustled up to us and said. &quot;err...no, we can't have a service dog upstairs...they're only allowed downstairs.&quot; &nbsp;ouch. &nbsp;really? &nbsp;so preux &amp; proper's position is that if you have a service dog they not only get to dictate where you can and cannot be, but also limit your entire dining experience? third impression: &nbsp;trekked downstairs, debating whether to create a ruckus or not. best not to involve chef john; &nbsp;this is my fight, not his. &nbsp;now the bar area is packed. &nbsp;out to the patio under a lovely california twilight sky where there's an &nbsp;italian pensione style, long high top table with stools all around. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in la loosens the guarded stance and refreshing cocktails make elbow to elbow positions definitely ok. &nbsp;young exec, great haircut and healthy tan looked up from his beer, &quot;oh, yeah, they're gone,&quot; and waved at the 2 open stools. &nbsp;&quot;you're lucky the waitress out here is good; &nbsp;she'll take care of you.&quot; &nbsp;good to know and we told him so.fourth impression: &nbsp;it really is quaint and right in the heart of downtown los angeles with big ficus trees on either side. &nbsp;traffic streaming past the patio on both sides was definitely slowing down. &nbsp;our heads swivelled tracking the waitress. &nbsp;&quot;coming up&quot; came the cheerful promise and the waitress that &quot;takes care of you&quot; zoomed by. the table &quot;server&quot;, we're assuming, cleaned up the mess, wiped the table, delivered menus and asked if we wanted some water; &nbsp;then confirmed our suspicions that service was a big question mark? &nbsp;patio food service meant - ordering at the bar. &quot;when do we pay?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;the bartender starts a credit card tab.&quot; &nbsp; ok. &nbsp;not what we expected. &nbsp;i would've fought a little harder to stay upstairs if i'd known what the segregation meant...but the damage was already done.fifth impression: &nbsp;the schussing waitress who really was only a cocktail waitress never came back. &nbsp;the server brought the apres <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menus. &nbsp;we walked in at 5:50pm but with all the seating and service delays, it was now 6:15pm and we already missed the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu? who only has <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> till 6pm??? &nbsp;disappointed!! &nbsp;did the bosses of the <span class="highlighted">happy</span> campers that were knawing on bones and slurping down their last <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> slushy and fruity drinks know their crew had cut out from work early? &nbsp;c'mon preux &amp; proper!! &nbsp;sixth impression: &nbsp;the menu is large for a &quot;find a seat wherever&quot; joint. &nbsp;the shrimp beignets were definitely not beignets. &nbsp;they are fritters, tasty but not beignets. &nbsp;chef john liked the frog legs; lightly fried finished with &nbsp;a spicy sauce with kick; &nbsp;fresh oysters were pre-tobasscoed and lemoned which is not acceptable darn it!! &nbsp;let me lemon and spice my lovely little molluscs in the manner of my own liking...while anticipating the slurping and full bodied splash of the ocean's salty brine. for those yelpers who say that the food arrives before the table settings - er...another peculiarity of preux &amp; proper is you need to go fetch your own cutlery. &nbsp; the tableware wrapped in fresh and spiffy cloth napkins are right by the doorway to the patio. &nbsp; what else did we have? &nbsp;oh yes...lobster po'boy and the fried rice. &nbsp;the rolls were soft and grilled just so, filled with a tasty lobster melange; &nbsp;fried rice? &nbsp;why? &nbsp;especially when there's china town right around the corner...why attempt something that's just going to make you look bad? &nbsp;seventh impression: &nbsp;we ordered wine; &nbsp;sadly, it was oxidized and i sent it back. &nbsp;the bartender made a personal trip to the table with a fresh bottle and poured. &nbsp;wish i could remember his name...well built irish chap that is honest and loves what he does. &nbsp;tell you what, preux and proper - he's your clean up batter. saves the day so to speak when the food is tasty but not remarkable; &nbsp;the service is none existent and conditions are crowded. &nbsp;keep the bartender, i will return just because he knows how to schmooze with humor and class; &nbsp;makes a great drink and he knows how to keep 'em coming back for more.
came here for dine la and ordered off the coursed menu. after placing the order the server tells us that all the food will come at once. why even present a coursed menu then? they should just list all the items and say: choose 3. so between my friend and i, 1 plate came early then all 5 came at once. the food was okay- not great but not terrible. it was overwhelming with 6 plates on the tiny table. we felt rushed by the server too- which was strange since there was only 2 tables on this patio. the place was dead. i would not come back for the food but i might consider cocktails only... if they had a cheap <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the view from the patio was the best thing about this visit and it was not that great. pretty atmosphere here though.
visited this place for dine-la event last week. i was super excited about it, because i love new orleans food, and their menu seems to be very promising. food:here's what we ordered from the dinela menu1st course: avocado toast and garlic chips and dip. the avocado was bland, and the toast wasn't very crunchy. garlic chips and dip was your average bag chive and onion chips with a side of dips. not impressed with either.2nd course: pork belly bites and charred cauliflower. the pork belly bites were placed in lettuce, it's quite enjoyable, though a tad bit salty. loved the charred cauliflower. 3rd course: duck and grits, crab meat. the duck and grits is my favorite out of everything here. duck was a bit dry though. &nbsp;crab meat smells a bit fishy, and a tad too salty. venue:love, love, love the venue, decoration, atmosphere. it's located on a land in between the two streets, with beautiful large windows. the decor truly reminds me of being in no. drinks:i think this place is the perfect place for a quick <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink, catch up with your friends. their cocktail is too sweet, but you can request it otherwise.service:very attentive service, our server came and check up on us a few times.
came here at the suggestion of a local who loves this place. &nbsp; the venue is awesome, and the service is great. &nbsp;the food is ok. &nbsp;i'm a southerner, so although the owners are from no, the food is meh. &nbsp; i did the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tour, which included the smoked shrimp beignets, corn fritters, fried oyster po'boy, and the crab cake. all of the food is heavily breaded, much more so than i'm used to when eating food from new orleans. &nbsp;flavors are good, but after two of the fritters i pushed them back. &nbsp;i tore open the beignets to pull the shrimp out and i took the oysters off of the roll and ate them separately. &nbsp; the crab cake was nice. &nbsp;more of a bar food feel than a great no experience. &nbsp;the service and energy make it worth the visit.
i booked a sunday birthday brunch here and was hesitant because i don't often have brunch dtla. &nbsp;the atmosphere was to die for and the service was really fantastic. &nbsp;the manager took really great care of my party of seven and our waitress was lovely and attentive. &nbsp;probably the best aspect of the brunch was the new orleans style jazz trio that was playing in the upstairs dining area while we were there. &nbsp;that, together with the airy french quarter feel, made it a great birthday location. &nbsp;the cocktails are fantastic and the selection of mimosa flavors were great for sunday brunch. &nbsp;though i am generally not a fan of ginger, you must try the ginger mimosa...a friend said it was the best champagne drink she has ever had. &nbsp;the only thing that was a little weak was the food. &nbsp;quality was good, but timing was a little off and the flavor's were nothing to write home about.bottom line...go for the drinks and atmosphere!! &nbsp;i will definitely go back for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink and app or brunch again.
a breath of fresh air in an otherwise smoggy downtown la. preux &amp; proper gives angelinos a reason to go downtown. the food is creative and tasty, the staff is friendly and at times hilarious and the drinks are the most refreshing. i love the amount of abita beer that is on tap, such a selection. the specialty cocktails is where it's at though. the west side is a drink that you drink everyday in the summer and never regret the hangover the next morning. as for the food, i tried the shrimp beignets because everyone said to. amazing. i then had the fried chicken sandwich. holy crap. you guys, when that is on the menu, you need to order that. i also went to the event called rhythm &amp; booze last tuesday. i mean come on, such a fun event. a late <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and music from brother sal just set the mood for the night. the crowd was live and loving every minute of it. i can't wait to go back for the next one. seriously go check this place out and bring a group of people to maximize the effect!
tried preux &amp; proper @ 7pm on a thursday night with some girlfriends. we made a reservation, but the place wasn't packed so we probably could have gotten away without one. there is a parking lot across the street for $8. street parking wasn't easily available. the restaurant is two stories and is classy but still casual. perfect for dinner with the girls, date night, or just to grab a drink at the bar downstairs. the bar has fat tuesday style slushy machines. after our meal, we were handed a small silver cup and told we could go downstairs to the bar and do some tastings. the mint julep slushy was good, the others were a bit too sweet.the food is small plates, meant to be shared, which we all know by now means pricey dishes that are uber rich. below are the dishes that we ordered for 4 women, and this was just the right amount. all the food was delicious and i would order it all again.smoked shrimp beignets 12remoulade dip, charred peppersfigs, speck, watermelon 12fig molasses, extra virgin olive oil, granasauteed long beans 8sauce picante, pecansdebris hash 18crispy pork belly, brisket, andouille, soft egg, potato, pepperssoft grits 6just grits. nothin' special.some fries dish that i can't find on the online menu.banana bread pudding 9rum anglaise, tempura banana,i love bread pudding but didn't think i would like banana bread pudding. i was wrong. this was delish!chocolate cream pie 9cocoa nibs, coffee foam(meh. i preferred the banana bread pudding)overall, good food, nice ambiance, friendly service, tasty drinks. next time, i'd like to check out <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to see if it's easier on the wallet.
i'm a sucker for new orleans food. so if someone wants to cook the bayou's best in la (that's los angeles, not the postal abbreviation for louisiana), i'm going to want to try it whether it's the little jewel of new orleans convenience market in chinatown or preux and proper in the wedge-shaped, short-lived parish space.dropping in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, we started with the vieux carre and sweet tea smash cocktails which were a bit flat. the food was anything but flat. the fried frog legs were meatier and less rubbery than most legs. it's impossible for frog to beat the best fried chicken, but these came very close. of course, there was some spicy heat, but it was at a friendly level. there was also the correct amount of heat in the po-boy with crunchy fried oysters. the sandwich was a bit skimpy on the number of oysters and the bread didn't need toasting because the oysters had plenty of texture, but it had a refined simplicity with the sliced tomatoes and arugula that hit the right marks. i wasn't a fan of the &quot;belly bites&quot; which were chinese lettuce wraps using diced pork belly.
i love trying different bars in la and preux and proper did not disappoint.the location of the place already is interesting as it is located within a fork in the road. i personally thought it added charm to the place and fit with it's new orleans/jazz inspired decor. the music played upbeat jazz with a lot of ray charles and the like.the upstairs had a private dining party so my friend and i just hung out at the bar downstairs, partaking in the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals while contemplating the balance of the lesser of the two evils. the golden state warriors or lebron. hahaha.*btw, now la will never hear the end of the warrior fans/bandwagoners taunts as they chant from basically, the entire northern half of california. i didn't know sacramento was considered the bay.... poor kings. lol.any hoot, the drinks were great and strong. the food was good. the company i found at the bar were amazing and we had a very civil time watching game 2. would i come here again? no doubt.
as a local, i was excited to see a new place open their doors that served food late. the concept is one of many popping up around the city (new orleans theme) and i think they used the space beautifully. i have been here twice and my favorite food options have got to be from the late night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu from (11pm till close). the belly bites and fries were all great. from the dinner menu, i had the roasted chicken which was not that good. the kale is done perfectly. the service is great and kudos on offering small cups to patrons so that they can try the booze slushies downstairs. if they are looking for constructive criticism i would say to focus more on improving the quality of the dinner menu plates. for the price of many of the items, i felt the taste and quality was a little lacking.
i have walked by this building for years and wondered when someone would finally buy this place and turn it into something amazing. well, it finally happened! i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (3-6) on a thursday around 5 pm. the place wasn't super packed and we were able to get a two top table by the window. i love the design of this place, very open, breezy, great views with a romantic and relaxed ambiance. very new orleans style, just really pristine and clean to be an actual bourbon st. bar :). they have a nice patio upstairs and downstairs, with the upstairs patio opening at 6pm. the drink menu looked really great, but with a $12-14 dollar price tag, we decided to skip cocktails and stick with their decent selection of $5 beers. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> consists only of food (no drinks) with items ranging &nbsp;from $5-$8 dollars. we decided to split the shrimp beignets to start. they came out hot and crispy, 5-6 pieces, with a side of what i would describe as cajun tarter sauce. pretty tasty to munch on, but i would like to try another small plate next time. we then ordered the oyster po boy and the brisket dip. the oyster po boy was fried nicely, the bread was perfect and the veggies paired well. it was lacking acidity and salt, so i requested some lemon and salt, which really made the flavors pop. my fiance ordered the brisket sandwich, which he devoured but also needed to add salt too. overall, i am really looking forward to spending more time at this perfect location and further exploring their menu!
good vibes and a great place to go for drinks after work. plenty of parking lots all around the restaurant, which range from $5 to $10 (remember to bring cash!). our party of 4 had a reservation at 6:30 and a few of us arrived early and had some drinks and fries at the bar during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (ends at 6). they have a garage-like type door that they leave open, so if you come during a cold night like i did bring a jacket as it can get really chilly! they also had a shuffleboard table so you can play that while you have drinks as well. by 6:10 we had all arrived so we headed upstairs (stairs are in the far back) and checked in at the cute little check-in table. we were seated right away and our extremely friendly and helpful server helped us place our orders. i believe he said he was from louisiana so he knew many of the new orleans based dishes very well. he described all the dishes as new orleans style with a los angeles twist. we ordered the andouille corn dog, gumbo fries, roasted marrow bones, and smoked shrimp beignets. the dishes are served family style so you order to share. my favorite dish of the night was the andouille corn dogs. it came with 4 decently sized corn dogs and fries with ketchup, mustard, and relish on the side. the sausages used in the corn dogs had a small kick of spice and the buns were perfectly crispy. the fries were great as well and had plenty of that southern cajun spice. the toasted marrow bone was okay (the bread that comes with it is delicious though!). i don't think i'm too big of a fan of marrow bone in general so i wasn't able to enjoy it too much. the gumbo fries somewhat reminded me of poutine fries with all its sauce and meat, but it was slightly bland. i'm unable to eat seafood so i can't say much about the shrimp beignets, but the rest of my party seemed to enjoy it and our server stated that it is their most popular dish.at the end of your meal they give you a small jar to take downstairs to the bar to get a free sample of any frozen daiquiri. the bartender was great in helping us choose our daiquiris. i would highly recommend dining here!
food is great. ambience is great... &nbsp;but the service here sucks. little service at all!my boyfriend and i came here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a saturday afternoon. we walked in to this cute new orleans style restaurant and it was not busy at all. saw the daiquiri bar and we were thinking &quot;oh okay cool place!&quot; we were ready to order our food! unfortunately.. about 15 min later, no server did not even come to our table to greet us and take our orders and drinks.. and we were just sitting there. we couldn't wait anymore longer so we just literally got up to the bar and told the bartender our order... how ridiculous! i thought this was a sit-down restaurant! we eventually got our food and the server finally attended to our needs. food was delicious, especially the shrimp beignets! anyways, quick summary: great food, but don't expect good service here.
nestled in between one of the busiest intersections in downtown la, preux &amp; proper is a surprisingly peaceful restaurant. located across the street from lauded verve coffee, perfect for all us coffee addicts. we came here for their dinela <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> week - $4 beers!! $3 oyster shooters! $16 lobster roll! the outdoor patio is beautiful! service was quick, and attentive- i give them 4 stars! oyster shooters were nothing to rave about, though they were large, i thought they lacked flavor - 2 stars. the cajun ketchup really took the kennebec thick cut fries up a level - 4 stars! the beer was a bit warm for our liking considering it was 4:30pm and still 77 degrees out - 2 stars. my only gripe about this place has more to do with location than anything else - flies were all over the outdoor patio (though not when we moved indoors and probably because of the heat and weather) and finding metered parking would be nothing short of a miracle. expect to pay between $5 and $10 at the plentiful nearby surrounding lots!
in dtla, great tapas and cocktails place. &nbsp;definitely not for a large group but intimate 4-6 people at most! &nbsp;i think i'd prefer it as a date spot or a girls night place. &nbsp;overall loving the place and vibe.ambiance: imagine new orleans but mixed with hipster dtla. &nbsp;i love the open air feeling with all the windows and the upstairs/downstairs. &nbsp;it's a bit of a smaller place though so there may be a wait if you come during dinner time.food: hit or miss but overall thought it was an interesting take on new orleans tapas.frog legs: salty but not badpork belly hash: heavy but good. &nbsp;pork belly and poached egg, you get a lot of creaminess and then potatoes. &nbsp;definitely share this.lobster po boy: i liked it but i have had better. &nbsp;chunks of lobster were a bit small.muffalata board: fun take on the deconstructed muffalata.oyster po boy: not bad, fried oyster was good.gumbo fried rice: lack-luster. &nbsp;not bad/not goodfresh oysters: can't go wrong!drinks: instagram worthy cocktails!the westside: yummy and not too sweetblackberry honey sour: love the taste of the blackberry, also was not too sweetservice: awesome. &nbsp;they were so attentive and i'm not sure if it was the owner, but he kept coming over to talk to us and make recommendations. &nbsp;we even got 2 tapas on the house!price: we spent $30+ a person for tapas and drinksparking: lots everywhere. &nbsp;when in doubt, park across the street though it is $10.tip:<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4-6
i've been to preux &amp; proper twice in the last month, and it's now on my list of low-key favorites for a sit-down meal downtown. it's a vibrant restaurant in the old parish space, with an upstairs dining room and a downstairs area with a bar, a patio, a shuffleboard table, and some smaller tables. the menu is new orleans fare, with cajun classics and a half dozen frozen daiquiris. the atmosphere is accordingly fun and festive.i first came on a tuesday night for a late, late dinner after the taping of the rupaul's drag race finale at the orpheum. this was the only restaurant within walking distance that was still open after midnight, and we were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to find that not only was the kitchen still cooking, we'd also stumbled into <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4 to 6 and 11 to 1, maybe every day?). we ordered at the bar, set up camp on the patio, and had a great time. service got a little tangled, but the result was that we got an order of corn fritters no one in the restaurant had ordered. it would've been nice if we'd been told some of the sandwiches came with fries, as we ordered a couple superfluous sides of these we might not have gotten had we known. we put them to good use, though, and otherwise, service was great. the guy who helped us was really pleasant. also, there was this amazing musician singing on the piano--not sure where they got him, but he's a winner.when my friends and i needed a last minute saturday night downtown dinner spot a week later, i immediately thought of preux &amp; proper and was able to snag an online reservation with zero difficulty. this time we ate upstairs, and the space was neat, not crowded but comfortably busy, with a lively atmosphere. service was slightly more formal during regular dinner <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, and our waitress was great.it would be a mistake to come here and not have a drink, and i'd recommend going for it with a punch bowl or a frozen daiquiri. the punch bowls are $45, and they're just large format versions of some of the cocktails, holding around four or five drinks. the cocktails are $13 apiece, so think of sharing a punch bowl as a more colorful version of splitting a table bottle of wine. the punch bowls are supposedly good for 4-6 people, but we split one three ways and that seemed right. we got the blackberry honey sour, which combined buffalo trace bourbon, lemon, honey syrup, and blackberries. it wasn't perfect, but it tasted reasonably good. it was definitely strong. i haven't tried the other fancy cocktails, but i've sampled several of the daiquiris. i got one on my first visit, and we all got sample cups with our dinner check, so we could try some on our way out the door. (this was actually a great way to cap off dinner, as we didn't get dessert.) there are six daiquiri flavors and i've now tried the mango margarita, the call a cab, and the mint julep. they're all pretty simple, satisfying, slushy, sweet, and sufficiently boozy. the mango margarita is just tequila, mango, and margarita mix; the call a cab is strawberry and rum; the mint julep rye, mint, and simple syrup, probably the least juicelike daiquiri on offer.the food is also great. i've liked everything i've ordered. off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu (which is also available for dinner), i'd strongly recommend the smoked shrimp beignets, the corn fritters, the proper fries, and the brisket dip. the shrimp beignets are delicious, hefty shrimp-studded balls of fried dough served with sea salt and remoulade. they're sweet, savory, and smoked, with excellent texture. the corn fritters are similar in function but not repetitive. they're wonderful little fritters bursting with corn, served with charred jalape&ntilde;o and creme fraiche. preux &amp; proper must just be good at frying things because the proper fries are some of my favorite french fries in l.a. they're wedge cut russet fries, crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. the seasoning is on point, and they come with a spicy cajun catsup. for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> meal, that brisket dip is pretty clutch. it's a meaty sandwich served on a thick roll with plenty of brisket, hot mustard, house pickles, bacon jam, and jus.i tried a few fancier small plates type dishes at dinner, and these were also successful. my oyster shooter was fresh and piquant, with a kumamoto oyster, some spicy sauce, and a pickly diced garnish. if the brussels sprout appetizer is on special, i'd definitely recommend this one to share. charred brussels, pulled pork belly, orange slices, fresno chiles, and peanuts--pretty ideal. for a light entree, the grilled shrimp works very well. it feels like a riff on the barbecue shrimp i've had in new orleans. heads on, succulent, in a sauce loaded with garlic and butter. they come with these cubes of starchy potato that don't quite do it for me, but i guess the dish would be too small without them.my friends and i have been pleased with preux &amp; proper. it's low hassle and fun, with good food and drink at a manageable price point. i'm <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to have it as a new go-to spot.
located right at the fork that separates spring and main. it's noticeably long and narrow but you'll notice the space is used well. despite the narrow structure of this place it is surprisingly roomy. the interior is elegant but remains casual, making it a fit place to drop in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or even a date night dinner. preux &amp; proper is a southern themed restaurant, more of a new orleans type fixture. i have to admit, it feels more like an la archetype, but it has just enough southern charm to help you imagine that you're sitting on the patio of a new orleans garden district home. my review is solely based on the cocktails, as that was the only purpose for our visit. i imagined they would serve n'awlins classics, sazerac and vieux carr&eacute;, given the southern concept. sure enough they were on the menu, so that's an assured positive - and that's the poison we had to go with. but make no mistakes about it, the cocktail list also offers other drinks for those that prefer a fruity touch in their libation. the drinks were exceptional, giving me the impression that the bartender definitely knew what he was doing. we enjoyed our drinks and an order of cajun fries by the window-side seating overlooking spring. the view wasn't the most impressionable but the ambience was right, with jazzy tunes playing in the background. the staff and bartender were all welcoming hosts, so they've got the hospitality down. overall, i felt it was an enjoyable experience. i'm likely to come back in the future.
i am always excited to try new things such as this new orleans styled bar and diner located in the middle of downtown/short walk from pershing square. came here for a thirsty thursday get together. preux and proper look like a two story townhouse from the outside. there is an extended patio for the ground floor with several long benches combined together to create a commune kind of seating.since we had a large group (around 10 people), we sat at the long benches. it was a bit cold at night so it would have been nice to have some heating lamps like the second floor balcony. instead, we made do with our various jackets.there are a variety of drinks on the menu. most of us got the daiquiris which were $10. you can add an extra shot for $3. there are lots of different flavors. i tried the mango and the strawberry. both were extremely sweet. in fact, the mango didn't even taste like mango much. there were other cocktails and they serve a variety of flavored moonshine. during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which starts at 11 pm, certain appetizers are a few dollars off. we got the frog legs, french fries, and shrimp beignets. the food was average at best. perhaps the actual meal items taste better, but since we were drinking, we ordered bar food. the food were all a bit heavy on spices, which overwhelmed much of the food items.service was attentive to everything. nice place to visit but i'm not sure if i will come back at night because a lot of hobos came to the patio to beg. it was a bit of a shock to see several people pop out of the semi-bushes. the security did their best to dissuade them from appearing, but it definitely serves as a dark reminder of the ever growing homeless population in the area. if you do see them, please offer them food as we wanted to do.
dinela <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> week - come at me.parking: street or nearby lot. bring cash just in case as most of them are cash only.food:seafood boil: mm the huge lobster pieces were my favorite! this thing was loaded with shellfish - i would say it's good enough to split between two people if you want a significant portion. broth was light but flavorful.corn fitters - i would pass on these as they taste as if they're made from the same batter as the shrimp beignets. definitely not enough corn.shrimp beignets - i thought this would rock my world, but it was just good. i had a really nice bite of shrimp, but there isn't a large enough portion of it to deem it a shrimp beignet..more of a beignet with shrimp.deviled eggs - if you like guacamole, you'll love this. loved the bacon bits, but i'm not a fan of avocado so i'll pass on this next time.fried oyster po boy - loved that this had arugula to balance out the flavor of the oyster. bread was decent, but the filling to bread ratio was too low for my liking.fries- they taste like they've been twice fried - exactly the way i like them! drink:sweet tea punchbowl- dang this thing was strong. maybe i'm super basic, but i love the idea of a huge communal punch bowl. i would say this is definitely worth the money as 4 of us struggled to finish it. great for large groups!service: our waiter was very attentive and charismatic. he checked on us occasionally and kept our water glasses full (and my boyfriend drinks a lot of water). atmosphere:p&amp;p is definitely one of those new generation of downtown restaurants - bar/restaurant/hang out. the first floor is standing room only while upstairs houses the restaurant. on the friday that we went, there was a live jazz band! pretty cool. i'd definitely come back on a warm summer night :) don't forget your complimentary daquiris on your way out!
welp, that was disappointing... the food was anyway. service was good though. &nbsp;def wasn't into the green beast cocktail i ordered (wayyyy too licoricey for my liking) and the mix daiquiris they have downstairs were beyond sweet. if you're tempted to order one, just wait till after your meal cause they'll give a free sample of it. we took one sip each of the mint julep and the pina colada and couldn't drink anymore cause it was too sugary, even if you could consider it a dessert. no thanky :| &nbsp;we did the dinela menu so we got to order all sorts of food and, although inexpensive at 30$ a person, wasn't enough for either of us to get full -- to be fair, maybe we shouldn't have held out from eating all day cause we thought it'd be super good. fav thing that we couldn't recreate at home (i'm just not at a point in my career that i can justify paying 10$ish for someone to toast my baguette and mash some avocado for me... yet! haha) were the duck n grits. highly recommend skipping the crab cause it was insanely fishy tasting. surprisingly spicy were the chips that came w the hummus and the pork belly. ending on a good note, easy paid parking right across the street for 5$ flat rate after 4pm, perfect to hit up their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that lasts till 6. the building is beautiful and has a nice ambience so might be worthwhile to chill out at one of the two bars up or downstairs -- i think i'd prefer upstairs bar since you can sit at one of the open window areas and people watch from above.
what a major let down.trusting the opinions of yelpers that i highly respect, i was very excited to try <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and dinela here. we didn't make it in time for hh, so we went with dinela. i love creole &amp; southern cuisine and am always stuffed silly; imagine my surprise when i found out preux &amp; proper is more tapas style. i hate tapas! expensive and the exact opposite of filling.for cocktails, we ordered the hurricane and blueberry smash. both were very strong so craig p. finished mine for me.dinela 3-course menu ($30 pp)chips &amp; dipavocado toastcharred cauliflowersmoked shrimp beignetsdebris hashduck &amp; gritsoverall, the food was okay and the flavors were too bold. there was too much going on and we thought every dish needed to be dialed back a bit. a lot of the ingredients didn't work together nor have any progression in flavors; they just existed. our favorite thing was the avocado toast; definitely the best dish of the night. i absolutely hated the duck &amp; grits as the duck was way too gamey and overpowered everything else. service was meh. we had a redhead as our server and we barely saw her. she was not engaging nor friendly. we did speak to a manager about how much we loved the avocado toast and he was really nice.our bill was over $100 and not worth it. afterwards, we were given a little complimentary &quot;night cap&quot;, which was awesome. they gave us two small empty mason jars to bring downstairs to the bar to get frozen daiquiris. i got call a cab (strawberry &amp; rum) and it was delicious, the highlight of my night. the bar area also has a shuffleboard table, so that was nice.i wouldn't come back to preux &amp; proper for food. i did love those daiquiris, but not enough to battle downtown traffic and find parking to come here.
been wanting to check this spot out for a minute so i swung by yesterday with some co-workers for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. parking in this area sucks so if its after 5pm your best bet is the lot across the street which is $5 flat. the space itself is really small. way smaller than i had imagined. the dining room upstairs doesn't open until 6pm so you pretty much just have to hope and pray you can get a bar stool and a table.the service here is pretty bad. there is one guy running food who will occasionally take your order but there is no consistency. there is one person at the bar that takes forever. people were lined up to put in food and drink orders and the bartender was trying to get to the people sitting at the bar and those in line but there was no method to the madness. they were helping people out of order and it just wasn't a good look. you end up wanting to order everything at once - which of course comes out all at once - just so you don't have to go back and try to put an order in. i am pregnant so unfortunately couldn't try the drinks but i hear the daiquiri's are great and they have 6 different flavors blending up. their wine glass pours are large and their ginger beer is super refreshing. as far as food goes, it was pretty tasty. we had the fries which were super thick cut. the smoked shrimp beniets which were delish, the corn fritters, which didn't have as much corn flavor as i would have liked but good none the less, the frog legs which weren't as meat as other frog legs i have had and looked pretty dark for the fry on them but they were still tender, smoked almonds which come in a cute little jar and are nice and warm upon serving. i'm half way curious what dinner service is like as i hear its better upstairs and the food is great, but the service we got downstairs made it all less than desirable.
preux and proper has long been on my list of bookmarks and after reviewing the menu it offered for dinela i decided it would be the perfect time to check it out. my friend and i met here after work at around 6pm and to my surprise the restaurant was a tall and narrow building that was part of an island separating two opposing streets of traffic in downtown la. the first word that came to mind upon entering the restaurant was airy. it was full of large, open windows and felt incredibly close to the street. it is the opposite of intimate as it was very bright with natural light coming from all the windows but it was still very welcoming. louis armstrong was playing in the background and though no one greeted me in the downstairs bar area the atmosphere still gave me an inviting feeling. as we waited for our upstairs dinner table, my friend and i perused the drink menu at the downstairs bar. we noticed a row of cocktail slushies that looked like a fancier version of those you might see at 7/11. we couldn't exactly decide which we wanted or if we wanted one at all so the bartender allowed us to sample each one in small mason jars. my friend and i each had our favorites. she really enjoyed the pina colada mixed with the banana fosters while i enjoyed the strawberry mixed with the mango margarita. a flight of these sweet, alcoholic sampler slushies was just the refresher we needed before heading upstairs for dinner. upstairs there are two and four-person tables near the open windows that allow you to have a great view of downtown while enjoying your meal. it also has another bar in addition to the one downstairs. as soon as we walked up the stairs we were warmly greeted by two hosts who sat us immediately. our server was very welcoming and polite, explained the dinela menu and advised what his favorite drinks were. my friend had the old fashioned and i had the hibiscus drink that our server recommended. my drink was very floral and refreshing and didn't dilute as the ice was arranged like an iceberg with the majority of it sticking out of the glass. i started with the chips and dips: soy bean hummus and voodoo chips. the taste of the hummus was very subtle and fortunately was balanced out with the flavor of the bbq chips that accompanied it. i then had the smoked shrimp beignets. they were definitely my favorite part of the meal. the breading and shrimp were warm and soft and didn't taste overly fried. the shrimp flavor wasn't underwhelming and tasted great with the tartar sauce. finally i had the crab etouffee. the crab was spiced up with a cajun flavor of sorts and really helped the more subtle flavor of the grits. my friend had the grits on their own and they really needed an accompaniment as they were a bit too bland to stand on their own. i loved the music, service, atmosphere and interior at preux and proper. it's really hard not to have a great time when you have an amazing view of the surrounding area with relaxing music playing in the background. however, i wasn't quite impressed with the food or the portions and am glad that i got to experience this place during restaurant week when i was able to try a few different dishes and get an overall feel for their meals. i would still definitely return for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to have another one of those slushies and wind down on the patio. this place is truly unique with the atmosphere it provides and is worth a visit.
i have personally come here 6 times since it opened. each time sitting at the bar on in the bar area. the first time my husband and i came we sat at the bar and everything was wonderful 5 stars... but there was only 5 other people in the bar the entire time. the remaining 5 times it has all been the same.... waiting waiting waiting.... last night my husband and i were seated in the bar area by a man in a red check shirt. the also seated the women who came in behind us. after waiting for about 20 minutes to even order (we watched the waitress go by at least 10 times (and there are only 6 tables inside and one large one out side)) the man in the red check shirt took the women's order but never cared about myself and my husband.normally i would tell you that maybe they did not see us... but i am 6' tall and i was in 4&quot; heels.... and my husband is 6' 10&quot;. the entire bar stared at us as we entered. the waitress smiles at me finally after about 25 minutes and asked if we had been helped... i stated no (very sternly so she would know i was upset) and told her that the women who came in after us were helped but we were not. i placed our 2 drink order and i ordered us some fries and an oyster po' boy. this was at 6:12 because my husband said <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended at 6 and we had gotten to the restaurant sometime around 5:45 pm. &nbsp;these are not &quot;busy restaurant&quot; times!!! my husband got his beer around 7 minutes later and she told me my drink was coming.... so we waited again...a staff member came out with the oyster po'boy and tried to deliver it to a table of 3 women sitting across from us... they said it wasn't theirs... then it went outside... still wasn't there's and the runner ran it all the way back to the kitchen.... then the runner took it right back out side and left it on the table... and the table patron brought the sandwich back to the kitchen.... i could only assume this was our sandwich.i still did not have even a water or the drink i ordered... and keep in mind i told the waitress as i was ordering how upset i was that others were helped first and how long we had been waiting. next a staff member came out with fries... and again tried to deliver it to the 3 top with the women.. who politely said it was not theirs... and the runner took the fries outside... and at this point i felt those must be ours as well... i attempted to stop the runner; but he just went back to the kitchen with the fries..i looked at my watch it was now 6:28pm... i had no drink... no water... no food... no service... i asked a different staff member to have the check for the beer because we wanted to leave.we waited about 5 minutes and the waitress came over and said &quot; i am so sorry, we have a new system and i was not aware. you will not need to pay for the beer.&quot;i said, &quot;i am very disappointed. my husband loves your po' boy ... and that is what he wanted. this is the 3rd time this has happened to us at your restaurant. we live right across the street and i have to tell you we are not going to be coming here anymore because of this terrible service&quot;.the waitresses said, &quot; i am sorry. the other times you have been here were you sitting down here at the bar or upstairs?&quot;i said, &quot;the bar&quot;.she said, &quot; that is why. they have not really figure out this part yet&quot;.my husband interrupted her and said &quot;well we try to support local businesses. and by not 'figuring it out' you need to tell the owner this will run him out of business, like the last restaurant that was here the parish!&quot;she said&quot; i am very sorry. would you like to speak with the manager and tell him this yourself?&quot;i said sure. but i was saying it in a really annoyed way. she said &quot;i will get him so you can tell him, and maybe he can 'do something' for you&quot;.we waited for about 5 minutes and left.i was not 'looking for something'!!!!!! i wanted 1 beer 1 blackberry whiskey smash 1 po' boy and 1 fry.... during &quot; <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; and now it was 6:40 and all i had was a half a beer.... i wanted out!this is just another l.a. restaurant; it is not staffed correctly... the quality control is not there... and you can not treat people like this.  i wish the manager would have spoken to me and made it right.note for management: if you have read this far you can see on my check in logs the exact times and days (with the exception of 3/6/15) that i was in your restaurant. i figure we spend on average (for just the two of us) $80 per visit and i always tip starting at 20%. last year we went to &quot;peking tavern&quot; 25 times. (check my check ins)you just lost about $2000 in sales from us. $400 plus of tips for your workers. lastly you lost my recommendation as well as somewhere i will bring people.
villains-tavern-los-angeles
not a bad place to get a drink during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
love villains tavern! they have the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!
not my music scene but super cool spot. go on the off days, hit up the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, grab a burger and fries (because the burgers here will surprise you..i guarantee it), sit by the fire and chill.
here's what i'd like to see on yelp if i wanted to find a great bar tucked away in the arts district:1. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>2. mixed indoor/ outdoor venue3. shuffleboard.the rest will be a blur!
food its salty. drinks are great. curse the line, it lasts forever! decent tap selection.this plate is far too small for such a large hot dog.they finally have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!
i gave them four stars instead of five because the few times i visited on a weekend, it was so packed that it was impossible for me to get a drink. &nbsp;i guess that's not really their fault, but at the same time it kinda is lol.i have also visited during the week for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the food on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu was surprisingly pretty decent. &nbsp;the carne and fish tacos were tasty and such a deal. &nbsp;i've also tried their version of elote which was not bad, and their pork sliders were yummy as well. &nbsp;they have a beer + shot combo deal for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that i usually order. &nbsp;a shot of jameson and beer for 8 bucks makes for one <span class="highlighted">happy</span> lil asian. i didn't notice at night, but the interior is pretty shabby. &nbsp;but i'm guessing that's the look they're going for. &nbsp;it's a chill spot.
**<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> review**it was a bit hard to find. &nbsp;the area didn't seem too safe for me walk around alone at night looking for the place but luckily i found someone to help me locate it. &nbsp;it's at the corner end of palmetto and in a big parking lot sort of area. &nbsp;the lot was full of huge trucks when i went and that threw me off a bit, but look for the big tent at the corner. &nbsp;it was dark and my first impression of the place wasn't the greatest, but i walked up to the bar and ordered a drink from its <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;passion flower it was. &nbsp;and it was delicious. &nbsp;now, on to bar food! &nbsp;their brussels sprouts were one of the best i've had. &nbsp;absolutely delicious. &nbsp;it had perfect combination of sweet and tangy sauce, creamy topping and perfectly roasted brussels sprouts. &nbsp;sliders were so good too. &nbsp;so good that we had to order another round. &nbsp;and lastly, fries! &nbsp;great fries. &nbsp;nothing to complain here. &nbsp;it was one of the best <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> i've had in a while. &nbsp;it's a good thing my drive to villains tavern is too hectic, because i'd be there way too often.
definitely a get away from the rest of downtown. love the outdoor seating, love that they have ourtdoor shufflepuck. &nbsp;i hear it gets crowded once the bands show, so come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and enjoy the daylight <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. enjoyed the hotdog even though the waitstaff suggested i go with the burger.
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here. lots of people come here after work <span class="highlighted">hours</span> to chill. nice atmosphere to relax and meet new people. place is not too big so the interior can feel claustrophobic with all the people crowded around trying to get drink from the bar. they even have live entertainment which really creates a lovely and fun environment. they make killer drinks here. like the whole mason jars idea too.
came in tonight for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tonight (st. patty's day ) and we were so disappointed that they didn't have green beer!! they made it up to us with $4 guinness! &nbsp;we also ordered fries and chicken skewers! the fries were amazing... super spicy and full of flavor! must order! the chicken was also very flavorful. since they are very close to my work, i will definitely be returning!!! cons: a little pricey and parking can be difficult. tonight, we had to park on the streets because they were filming something in the area and the crew took over their parking spot!
villains is a pretty decent bar.service is super duper slow! you have to order at the bar and there is usually only 1 person working. free street parking.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is until 8 pm daily. has food and drink deals. all food items are $5 for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.fries - decent fries. seasoning was lacking but my wife swears they are usually really good.sliders - they ran out of slider buns so they gave us the villains burger. the sliders have the same toppings. the grilled tomatoes are good. they make the burger. everything else is basic.brusslesprouts - seasoned very well. the glaze is sweet, which cuts the bitterness off the sprouts. beer is $1 off. prices range from $6-8 normally. they were out of a lot of beers which is pretty dumb for a bar. you can add a shot for $4 bucks but you do not get the dollar off from hh.highlight is the $1 heineken light chips. girls walk around and give you chips for $1 cans of heineken light which you get at the bar.would be an awesome bar if they fix the slowness.
adore adore adore. came on a monday night and we basically had the place to ourselves. the free parking (on a big lot), smiling (and intimidatingly gigantic) bouncer, colored glass decor, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 'til 8, and ultra-low lighting helped this bar find a way to my heart.bartender was friendly and helpful when i asked for the rundown of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks. i went for the $8 (usually $13) zoe rose, a tequila/curacao/cayenne concoction that was tall, sweet, strong, and delicious. paid at the bar and sat ourselves on the outdoor &quot;patio&quot;. its dark, with only a candle at each table, and a small stage area. this place kinda has a run-downlouisiana/creepy-magical/movieset feel to it. whatever playlist the bartender had playing on the speakers was fantastical.i plan on many more visits to try the food, catch the live music, and taste the rest of the drinks. thanks for all the yelp tips to not come on friday nights when its uber packed.
i love the ambiance!such a cool place to bring a small group of friends or a date. i've been trying to explore dtla area more lately and this was a great first place to go! when you step in, it feels like you are in a secret apothecary place that's also hipster/cool at the same time. i don't consider myself hipster at all, but sometimes i'm drawn to these kind of places. the people you meet are always interesting, and the bartender just might even have an awesome mustache :)<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food: no more brussel sprouts?!?! i saw pics of it on yelp! and wanted to try it but they no longer had it on their menu :((((fyi it opens at 5:30 pm, at least on thursday when i went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> time. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is quite limited, but if you're not picky, i'm sure you can find something you like. i'm glad we were one of the first ones there though because there was only one bartender/waiter taking our order at the bar. after we ordered, he made the drink right there in front of us so it slowed down the line quite a bit. the line was starting to get pretty long with several small groups of people before a second guy came to help out.i had a burger and drink, and my friend ordered the chicken skewer and fries. they forgot her sauce but she said it was really delicious even without it. i like veggies so i asked to have tomato and lettuce on my burger - they said no. wahhhht? ok haha...they were pretty strict about that. they said it was b/c there's some special pickle thing on it and you can't add any toppings. the burger was pretty good, but i still felt the l/t were lacking for some added freshness.the drinks were strong and tasty! i had the strawberry basil one (vodka based) and my friend had the other pink one (forgot the name) which was whiskey based. i loved the snow on top!location/parking: it's kind of in a random area of town, but the nice thing is that since it's away from the main street areas packed with bars and stuff, the parking is better here. you can tell you're in the art district when you look at the walls around you. as far as parking goes, we easily found free street parking since we went there so early but i can see it getting more packed at night when the venue gets more poppin'. music: there wasn't any yet when i was there, but i think it was just too early. i'd like to come back next time when they have music.
villains is pretty damn cool. &nbsp;i love the name of this place, it definitely describes the atmosphere.this area is slowly coming around, but i still highly reccomend parking in the lot or as close as possible to the entrance. . . don't risk a knife fight with some coked out bum. thumbs up:parmesan friesmaple bacon caramel cornbeer and shot combothe things that i wasn't too fond of:no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ($11-$12 cocktails)the crowd was a bit older (30's-late 40's?) &nbsp;i came after work on fridaybi-polar music. i did however really enjoyed some of the french music they played.
hung out on the patio and enjoyed spending time with my friends before the place got crowded. &nbsp;the bathroom situation is now much-improved from last year, with more bathrooms just to the right of the entrance. &nbsp;the first band was so-so but the second musician (blues man brother yusef) was really good. &nbsp;nice temperature to the patio. &nbsp;drinks are pricey, and i wish they had a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> selection. &nbsp;but the bartenders are super-friendly and it sets a nice tone for the rest of the evening.
great hidden bar in the middle of nowhere!! &nbsp;it's next to the bridge and located in an area that looks abandoned (at least at night). &nbsp;they had live music and a pretty outdoor area with good seating. &nbsp;they make specialty drinks which was quite good! &nbsp;this would be a great place to meet friends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or late night drinks...good mixed crowd or ages between 25-45.
this place is really good for large groups of people, and the music is pretty sweet. the beer/shot combos are decent, but if you leave your credit card, make sure they don't over charge you. we went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and was charge double the amount. not cool. we also had the burger, that was just ok &amp; overpriced. i'd rather go to umami if i'm going to spend money on a burger. the people are cool &amp; laid back, but not alot of diversity.
the neighborhood is sketchy. &nbsp;don't do what i did -- go alone, while female, by public transportation (which doesn't get you very close) and then on foot.i seem to remember reading about all the effort that went into designing and decorating this place. &nbsp;if so, it was wasted. &nbsp;it was plain and ugly.the layout is awkward and confusing. &nbsp;there's an outdoor area before you get to the bar; then there's an upstairs area after you get to the bar. &nbsp;it was hard to figure out how or where to order. &nbsp; i *think* you have to order both food and drink at the bar, then find a seat for yourself. &nbsp;however, menus were scarce and hard to find.the bartender was the big plus. &nbsp;my drink was super tasty, though tiny. &nbsp;and the bartender gave me the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price, even though <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was technically over by a few minutes.my original plan was to have two or three drinks (hence the public transportation) plus dinner. &nbsp;the place was so uncomfortable, however, that i had one drink, then left.fortunately, on my way to the bus stop, i spotted church &amp; state! &nbsp;but that's a separate review.
what was i thinking!!! why was i not here before???the drinks are amazingly delicious. the belladona has an interesting twist when you mix in the bramble of blackberries. i had another drink that was new to the menu - something peachy (wish i remembered). most of their drinks remind me of a bad ass raspado (shaved ice). need a refreshing drink order here!!!during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> we tried = cesar salad (with lots of fresh parmesan cheese), grilled cheese with side of wicked fries (fantastic) and fish tacos (with green spicy salsa). everything was so good that not a crumb made it out alive.live music - blues.atmosphere - hello!!!would i be coming back, hell yes!!!*order at bar - drinks and food*pay or open tab*take number and find seat*enjoy your night!!!!
if i was a vampire and wanted to go out on a friday night i'd head to villians tavern. &nbsp;no really, i feel like it should be a bar in true blood. &nbsp;with that said, i really like true blood so of course i liked villians! &nbsp;the bartendress was super nice and the drinks were fun. &nbsp;who can say no to a shot and beer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> combo. &nbsp;yep, awesome! &nbsp;i played shufflepuck and dominated, okay that's not entirely true. &nbsp;i like to pretend. &nbsp;the indoor decor was pretty sweet and the burgers looked yum-central. &nbsp;the crowd was diverse and it wasn't too busy for friday hapy <span class="highlighted">hour</span>. &nbsp;there was an awning but you still could get some of the sun on the porch. &nbsp;later in the night they turn their parking lot into valet. oh la. &nbsp;overall it was an enjoyable stop on my la tour.
atmosphere:if you're looking for this place, and feel like you've made a wrong turn, are in the wrong neighborhood, or are seeing endless rows of empty streets and warehouses, keep going. you're on the right track. this small brick building looks like it was just dropped onto the corner of a vacant parking lot and haphazardly wrapped with a tall tarped fence. to make a &quot;patio environment&quot; on the inside. however odd it looks from the outside, objective achieved. i felt transported to the 1920's when i walked through the entrance and was faced with a tall glass window fa&ccedil;ade lined with different colored bottles like an apothecary would have in their storefront. inside, the wood bar, old pictures mounted on the wall, cash register, every little detail was in theme. it was fantastic. food:great, large veggie burger with a generous amount of &nbsp;addicting fries get the fried chickpeas appetizer. drinks:no wine.. saaaad face.plenty beer options on tap.&quot;libations&quot; are not &quot;calorie-friendly&quot; (yeah. i said it. sue me) but are very interesting looking and tasting. $12 for most..belladonna - not my favorite. muddled blackberries just piled on top of crushed ice with hard liquor and mint at the bottom of the mason jar. (not as tasty as it sounds)overall: the bartender wasn't the most helpful when i was trying to determine what drink to buy (i usually just drink wine!). he wasn't mean but he didn't seem to have much patience for the novice hard-alcohol drinker. the patio was a nice place to sit. not cold at all.. there were plenty of people from <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (time.. there is no <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu fyi) until late into the night. overall fun place to try in downtown. just don't drive there alone..
love this place! &nbsp;yes, it's sort of a typical la bar...but i really like the steampunk theme and old fashioned drinks (albiet a very modern price). &nbsp;i felt transported to another time and place. all the old jars and glasses on the windows, it's a really cool setting.the beer and a shot for $10 is by far the best deal. &nbsp;it's good for a night when i just want to get a buzz and could really care less about some fancy concoction. &nbsp;i admit, these libations created by the lovely mixologists of this place do make yummy drinks that isn't another typical martini. &nbsp;i usually order two rounds of the $10 steal and i'm set for the rest of the night (that's if i'm driving ayway).i'd prefer this place during a weekday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the weekends are just too nuts for me. &nbsp;i hate crowds.
this place looks awesome from the moment you arrive. love the antique glass everywhere. upstairs is a comfy cool nook to sit. back area was also conducive to chilling out. the passion something or other cocktail -- very tasty. good beer selection. apricot hefeweizen was good, although they were out of the beer i first wanted. because of that and having to shout over the music -- which my friend and i both totally dug -- only 4 stars. and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices not that <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. 1 drink + 1 beer = $17.
this place is cool!came here to celebrate a friend's birthday the other night...and though i didn't think it was quite the venue i would have selected for an intimate birthday celebration...we had tons of fun and would totally visit again.the drinks are served strong and strong. &nbsp;meaning, if you want some cute, little, girly, apple martini like drinks...you'll need to go elsewhere because only drinkers and cool people need be here. &nbsp;luckily, i was invited and came early...or else they might have rejected me at the door. &nbsp;all of their specialty cocktails made with fresh fruit and ingredients. &nbsp;my favorite was the russian mule (like the moscow mule) and this fresh grapefruit cocktail.the prices are extremely fair....especially for the food, given the generous portions they come in. for snacking...order the caramel popcorn and chick peas!definitely a fun place...i will def be back next time for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals!
dog friendly? check.dark and sequestered upstairs seating? check.kinda cool, isolated locale? check.oh, and there's parking too.as far as my libation, i partook of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special bella donna: $8 for maker's mark, mint, citrus and blackberries. once i fought my way through the snow cone of ice on top, it was pretty tasty, and the muddled blackberry on top was most fetching. not quite a serving of fruit, but nevertheless lovely. was it among the most tasty of cocktails? no, not by a long shot, but it was perfectly serviceable, and the mister and i enjoyed listening to the eclectic playlist from the top of the balcony.all in all, a nifty place for a late afternoon hiatus before the trek back over the hill to the sanctuary that is casa samson.
we came here for quick bites during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. waited 30 minutes to order (groups of girls came after us but they didn't wait in line and they started ordering bunch of drinks before us). then we waited another 20-25 minutes, we see the waiter has our food but he went to some other table. waited another 5 minutes, found out our waiter gave our food to some other table. waited another 10 minute or so to get our food.so yeah, we were here for an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to get fries and two orders of sliders. i thought the food was fine, but the service sucks. sorry, not going back.
my friend planned a fun day and this was the last stop of the day. we got there right as they were opening, and within minutes there were 4-5 different groups of people already! cocktails are a little pricey (about $13) and beers are about $8 i believe.seems like a fun place to hang out at night! we only stayed until about 7pm, and headed home to grab dinner. i got the passion flower and one of my friends got the zoe rose. both were very delicious cocktails! i really liked the passion flower because it was light and refreshing. perfect for a summer afternoon! the drinks were definitely made with care! lot of different ingredients. we got a few snacks to much on. the fries were perfectly seasoned and came with a great sweet garlic dipping sauce! the salted caramel corn was also a good pick! think sweet meets salty! also another great snack to munch on! i think we came for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because we got two fries and a basket of salted caramel corn for only $7! super cheap considering each basket is about $4 to $6! plenty of parking and it's free! it is hard to find a bar in downtown la where there is free parking (and not street parking). definitely want to come back with friends for a later evening hangout!
they make a mean hot dog with some serious mustard and it is really tough to beat such a phenomenal bar game as giant jenga (wednesday nights). the drinks are tasty and with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials, three beers and a hot dog came out to just $25! a perfect way to wrap up surviving the first three days of the work week.the night i was there was a little odd in that the adjacent film lot had beefed up security and there were cop cars at both entrances with their lights on. my friend and i were actually pretty convinced that there was a dead body or, at the very least, a small meth lab on premises but decided to ask what was going on anyhow. thankfully, we were informed that the bar was, indeed, open though it is definitely something to keep in mind if you show up and it looks like an episode of csi.
love the decor and the live band at night. &nbsp;especially love the giant jenga competition they do, i'll give it a shot the next time i come back. &nbsp;even though they don't have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, they do serve a beer and a shot for $8 bucks all night long! &nbsp;worked out perfectly for me and my friend since she only wanted beer and i only wanted shots. &nbsp;we tried two different food item here, bacon caramel popcorn and the grilled cheese sandwich. &nbsp;the popcorn was good but i don't have much of a sweet tooth so it didn't call to me. &nbsp;the grilled cheese on the other was quite delicious. &nbsp;too bad we weren't too hungry that night or else we probably would have tried every item on their menu.
i forgot this place's name until i saw the review on home page, i am glad i recognize the photos. i loved this place, i didn't order any food, my bf did, fish and chips looks yummy, and some sandwiches look good too. the most i love about this place is because they have big selection of ale! i am an ale person! i love hoppy pale ale. they have a few choices there. service was great, he kept bringing me more ale, and reminded me <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was almost over if i wanted more. how thoughtful :)i like the decor so much, they have lots of british royal highness paintings, i recognize the tudors and ann boleyn, cuz i am so into their history. :p they have pool tables, gives u more things to do there.this place is good for a fun night out with other half or friends :)
came here on a sunday afternoon around 5 pm for a friend's birthday. this is an odd place.the best part is the bar. rows and rows of colored-glass bottles lit up from behind make an impressive backdrop to the bar, and it's really cool that it's in this little tucked-away room. the bartenders are really competent; they really know what they're doing as they mix it up! also, sunday's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are pretty awesome! i had the most delicious cocktail called a bella donna; it was like a vodka snow cone! super tasty! the bf got a huge mason jar of noble pilsner beer for about the same price.the strange part is the rest of the venue. it's like a circus tent set up on the asphalt of a parking lot, and there are tables and chairs inside the tent, but it was really dark in there. no lights at all. we had to go sit outside on the small patio for a moment to get out of that claustrophobic tent. even outside it was really dark. i couldn't see my friends' faces even when they were sitting right in front of me. finally after an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> of this, an employee turned on the patio lights. the grateful crowd clapped and cheered. also, it's cool that the bar is separate but the cocktail mixing requires time, so the line quickly built up and the small bar room grew congested with a throng of people. the line became so long that i completely gave up trying to order a second drink. it wasn't worth it to stand in that line.we stayed because it was a friend's birthday, but only for that reason.
i was excited to finally visit the spot and loved it upon arrival - there's a big free parking lot that leads right into the double-wide doors, which lead right into the heart of the bar, which sits in front of this amazing wooden mirror art. from the bar looking out, there are hundreds of colored glass bottles sitting on shelves along the large glass windows, filtering the light in their rainbow colors. there's seating inside and outside and best of all, upstairs. this is where the wild west comes in - sitting upstairs, i felt like i was in an old western shanty-town keeping tabs on all the locals. very cool.besides the $3 schlitz, villains also offers $3 bud lights &amp; tecates (which they had run out of). on top of that, they've got a wide selection of draft beers served in glass mugs for $6 - add a shot and it's only $8. for a medium-sized draft beer + shot, it's $10 and for a large w/shot, it's $16. prices go up for premium &amp; super premium drinks.not as budget friendly are the $10 wines by the glass, the $12-13 specialty drinks, and sadly, the awesome $9 sno-cone fix that villains is known for. pick any fruit and any spirit and they'll make you up a delicious grown-up sno-cone treat; i don't think i've had a better cocktail in recent days than the fantastic strawberry &amp; rum concoction i ordered. booze got lemon &amp; vodka, which was all right, but man, mine was better :).as we had dinner plans to visit wurstk&uuml;che just a few blocks away, we forwent the dining experience at villains, though i definitely plan to sample some vittles next time i visit. in the past, my <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tour partner has tried the grilled cheese with bacon marmalade and loved how crispy the sandwich was. some other exciting <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>-y food options include fire roasted corn on the cob ($4), bourbon bacon caramel corn ($5), wicked fries w/ parmesan &amp; parsley ($6), and indian peas - deep fried chick peas dusted with chili-lemon sea salt ($5). dios mio, i'm salivating just thinking about my next visit!!
food: 5 starsomg. i think the veggie burger was the best burger i've ever tasted! and what was up with those delicious fries?? i don't even eat fries and i cleaned my plate!service: 5 starseveryone was super friendly. from the bouncer, to the busser, to our bartenders. seems like they either left their hollywood attitudes at home, or management knew how to pick em! our bartenders let us sample the beers, they gave great recommendations, they were patient and nice about our party of 6 with separate tabs. this is what brings a place up to 5 stars! ambiance: 5 starsloved the decor. very unique, very chill (i left by 8:40 before the live music). a different vibe here, great place to just hang with your friends. &nbsp;price: 5 starsi think i was there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because you got a free shot with your beer! in general it wasn't the cheapest place, but it was definitely worth the money.
another great spot that doesn't advertise the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they host (5-8pm) on their website. we arrived around 6pm on a wednesday evening and only had one person in line in front of us. i noticed throughout the evening how ridiculously long the line grew. there also was only one bartender so people had to wait quite awhile. getting right down to business - the brussel sprouts here would be the main reason i rated this place a 4 (otherwise i would have gone with a 3). they come in at $5 a bowl during the hh and omg they are hands down the best i have ever had. i don't even like brussel sprouts. the villains burger was mediocre. we also tried the sliders which cost $5 for two. i would recommend getting 3 orders at $15 rather than paying $14 for the villains burger. the drinks from the hh were pretty phenomenal. at first i noticed how tiny the mason jars were. but the taste and strength of alcohol definitely made up for that! i tried the zoe rose and my boyfriend had the bella donna. i prefer the zoe rose which is slightly spicy. these drinks will set you back $8 if it's before 8pm. the third drink offered on the hh menu was the passion flower which i will try upon my return. the restroom for women (outside) wasn't the cleanest. they also had no soap! that always worries me a bit but i don't think it would stop me from returning to this bar.
i came here with a friend, she picked it. i had never been, she's a regular. they had a good selection of beers and although they ran out of the beer i wanted, the bartender was helpful and suggested something similar. my friend suggested we get some food bit i wasn't really hungry. i didn't want to be rude and agreed. boy was i glad i did agree. we shared a demon burger, wicked fries and a bacon marmalade grilled cheese.they were all great but my favorite was the grilled cheese with marmalade: i'm a sucker for sweet and savory!not only was the food and drinks good but i loved the decor and layout. i came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so they were a lot of people just out work. i'd come back at night but it is a bit isolated. i wish it were closer the other bars in downtown as it would be one of the bars i frequent when i'm bar hopping in dtla.
i seriously have no clue why this place has 4 stars! i am in utter disbelief. i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a friday with my co workers. my first thought was &quot;oh this is a cute hip place&quot; until i go to get my first drink 2 groups ahead of us. took us about 30 minutes. why? because these are the slowest bartenders in all of la!!! it was such a hassle to get drinks because of how long it takes. apparently this place is too hipster for any known liquor brands. whatever! the grilled cheese might give you a heart attack aside from a bad tummy ache and the runs! the only good thing about this place is street parking and the brussel sprouts! delicious! the service aside from the slow bartenders sucked! they people that brought out our food basically slammed the plates down and were bothered when we asked for napkins, ketchup and forks! for certain i will not be back. this place really deserves 0 stars!
finally made it to villians. i have to thank vixen's l.a. <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> for first tickling my imagination a year ago about this place. how did it take so long to stop by? what you don't read vixen's blog? here's a link to what she has to say <a href="/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vixenslahappyhours.com%2f2010%2f08%2fvillains-tavern.html%3fm%3d1&amp;s=fe17aa18a6577d38548096e67c129b075740d3ec38225ff0e2ecd0c1df6d0e8b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">vixenslahappyhours.com/2…</a>villains tavern does a good job of creating an experience. the entryway walks you across a narrow patio directly into the bar with its grand carved and mirrored back drop that looks gothic and was originally housed in a salt lake city monastery. isn't it ironic don't ya think. the spectacular headboard is appropriate for the spectacular cocktails unspectacularly served in mason jars.the bartender told me the owners are opening a new bar in an old church in silver lake in january 2012. sign me up!i had two cocktails both of the whiskey variety:astarte - refreshing whiskey with muddled strawberry and cucumber mixed with citrus and rose water (perfect for summer)belladonna - makers mark, citrus, with a glacier of ice and a bramble of blackberriesi also orders a couple major jars of beer served with the complimentary shot of whatever liquor you want. i chose tue new bulleit rye and great divide yeti an imperial stout.the food menu is solid. i had asada and fish tacos along with a basket of fries.the weather was perfect last night for the partially enclosed patio.the band hello trouble laid down some sweet country and rockabilly tunes for our delight.
i'll start with the good: &nbsp;loved the decor of the place and seems like a cool place to hang out and get drinks. &nbsp;but here's the bad: &nbsp;rude female bartender that didn't know how to make drinks. &nbsp;we ordered a drink off of their specialty cocktail list ($13), it was a lavendar blueberry something and at first she hesitated because she wasn't sure if they had all the ingredients, then after checking she confirmed that she did have the ingredients. &nbsp;then she proceeded to make the drink but kept referring to the menu to check the ingredients. &nbsp;we also ordered a few other drinks for my group of 7 people. &nbsp;i tasted my specialty cocktail and it definitely wasn't what i imagined, but i thought maybe it's an acquired taste. &nbsp;i had my friends try it and they all exclaimed it was disgusting and to return it. &nbsp;we went to the bar to return the drink and she gave us a hard time! &nbsp;finally she relented and said she would do it this time. &nbsp;i asked for a simple gin and tonic in return and she just gave me well gin and a very small pour, didn't even fill the jigger up. &nbsp;i would think that being a bartender she should at least know how to make the specialty drinks and if not be nice about it and offer a replacement without being a bitch. we had also ordered a red wine for my friend and it was stale, but after the poor experience with the bartender we didn't bother trying to complain. &nbsp;i may try this place again, but not unless it's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because the drinks definitely weren't worth the high price.
when i first heard from my friend that drinks come in mason jars, i wanted to check it out. what novelty! &nbsp;drinks come in three sizes of mason jars: small, medium, or large. apparently they are all obtained from different places, so i'm assuming they were mostly donated.i came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a saturday, so there was no crowd. cocktails were about $1-2 off, and i think the mix &amp; match drinks (beer + a shot) were half off. they didn't have a very exotic selection for these, just very basic beers and shots. they do have some interesting signature cocktails, but because i was dd, i didn't get a drink. i really wanted to try the inigo montoya though (&quot;you killed my father. prepare to die!&quot;)the ambience was very interesting. the whole place reminded me of a saloon that you would find in western movies, except it looks more like a cross section of a house with a yard on its side. there's a small second floor where i would assume shady business is conducted because of how dark it is, and the first floor has a large open area under a tent where there are more tables (this is the yard). the neighborhood can seem pretty shady, especially at night. there's nothing around the bar except for factories, but it does have its own parking lot.
came to villains tavern for a special event sponsored by &quot;this is not a pop-up&quot; which specializes in getting leading edge chefs around southern california to cook for a short length of time to show off their culinary skills &amp; imagination. &nbsp;the theme of the ayce was louisiana crawfish boil with sides such as sweet corn bread, dirty rice, grits with sauteed mushrooms, red beans with pork belly, french fries with cajun seasoning. &nbsp;the boiled crawfish &amp; sweet corn boil in the spice mix were great....very close to what you would find in west feliciana parrish in southern louisiana. &nbsp;the louisiana style crawfish boil spice mix is full of powdered spicy hot red chiles, garlic, probably allspice, cloves, cinnamon,etc which creates a complex, totally satisfying complement to the crawfish as well as accentuating the contrast of the sweet, fresh corn to the heat of the chiles. &nbsp;mexicans, i'm sure, can relate to this by &nbsp;sprinkling on dried chile powder called &quot;pico de gallo&quot; on their boiled corn cob.to pair with this feast, i decided to get a truly exotic concoction which i saw previously being made for another customer. &nbsp;the drink, i found out, was named after loki, the god of mischief in the pantheon of germanic/nordic gods. &nbsp;loki was a trouble maker and could sometimes fool even odin/wodin, the king of the gods, into doing something that could adversely affect mortals as well as the gods.loki was a mixture of various infusions such as honey peach, various citrus flavours, liquers, angostura bitters as a finishing touch. &nbsp;of course, the bartender was rather vague about the ingredients since some of these cocktails are proprietary secrets of the house. &nbsp;the bar-t put a snow come of crushed ice so it looked like a cold volcano &amp; added more angostura bitters as a coloring on top. &nbsp;he garnished with a single grey-green leaf of sage. &nbsp;loki was more like an herbal, citrus fruit driven tonic with sweet bitterness. it is certainly a thirst quencher for a hot summer, early fall afternoon. to top it off, it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices so i got $2 taken off so that it cost $11. &nbsp;not cheap, but with all the work needed to make the infusions, the price was justified. &nbsp;it was perfect in putting out the heat of the chiles in the louisiana spice mix, and it was a good palate cleanser between bites of the spicy cajun/creole louisiana cuisine. &nbsp;the mood at villains tavern is noir, lugubrious, brooding even on a bright afternoon, warm sunny day. &nbsp;in the dead of night, it would seem to be the ideal venue for the nosferatu's, vampires, &amp; the undead to congregate into the wee <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of the dark, dark night. &nbsp;be sure to wear a garland of garlic around your neck &amp; carry a gun with only silver bullets, and &nbsp;that may still not be enough.
i gotta claim hipster discrimination at this place. i live in silver lake but this downtown arts district gives up nothing to the sl when it comes to curly mustachios and men in tight fitting clothing. came with a fellow non hipster. let's just call him cal. cal is white, from iowa and likes to wear baseball caps. we had just come from golfing at the los feliz par three so i was dressed in some jcrew and plaid shorts -- hipster strike #1....cal's hat said ucla. cal was told to take off hat by bouncer in long locks that was reading some poetry because he probably visited city lights bookstore once or twice when in san francisco. even though fashionista male hipsters hoping to become the next steve madden were parading around in knock off ed hardy type hats with the bill straight... sports hat = hipster strike #2... bouncer said it was czu people get &quot;mad crazy about their team.&quot; cal points out there is no tv in bar as hipsters hate sports because they got picked last in gym class...we are then told they don't have full menu at the moment. only option is basically pulled pork and chip/fries... we came cause yelp said they have burger and its a gastro pub.bartender can't figure out how to get me side of mayo even though pulled pork came with it... finally after 2 trips back to kitchen i am told i have have a side of mayo. hipster in service industry actually had to do their job for the expected 25% tip = hipster strike #3. in all fairness i thought the pulled pork was decent but it was smothered in this spicy mayo that may have masked the taste. chips were cold and soggy... mayo was the best thing about the place. cal doesn't get hipster mayo so he had his plain and said it was dry and tasteless.on way out some guys in baggy hoodies and la dodger hats left. we pointed out to bouncer the dodger are also a sports team. bouncer said they know the chef... apparently you need a chef to serve one sandwich and fries. we asked bouncer if he was aware of the aclu. bouncer said he's never heard of them. should also point out bouncer is african america. cal tells bouncer he should put down the bukowski and pick up some malcolm x. we leave never to return. prosthe beers are ok is diverse selection but way overpriced for where they are in location. $10+ unless you get a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special like heiny light for $1 which saved the experience for us. conseverything else. too many hipsters. service with attitude and not a full menu on a saturday afternoon.
went here thursday for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work.pretty difficult to find and once you do find it, you'd wish it wasn't in this neighborhood.they have parking but their &quot;lot&quot; was full at 6 due to no marked parking spaces and people parking haphazardly with no regard to others.once you get inside the bar has a pretty good feel and neat decor. plenty of outside seating with propane heaters and a cozy upstairs seating area.it is a neat concept with mix and match beer and shot combination for pretty good prices. good selection of beer and liquor so no complaints there.my biggest complaint thought is the inordinate amount of time it takes the bar tenders to make their &quot;specials&quot;. each drink consists of no less than 10 separate steps and each is completed with a different type of liquor that is at opposite ends of the bar from each other.it's a neat concept that the bar takes time to craft these special drinks but the amount of time to complete these tasks is unacceptable.i needed a drink so i head to the bar (no waiters or waitresses) and thankfully only a party of two people waiting in line ahead of me. i honestly waited more that three songs playing on the radio before the bartender completed one of their drinks, tested it through a straw, dumped it out and started over.i appreciate their concern for quality control but this situation needs to be remedied. there were three bartenders at the beginning of my venture to get a drink and during this time, the line grew in extreme proportions.at one point, while there were ten people in line, one of the bartenders (who appeared to be a shift manager) stopped making drinks, pulled out his cellphone, and proceeded to converse with a patron and then headed upstairs without looking at the line of potential customers.luckily for me, the gentleman behind me in line was talkative and we started up a small conversation. one of my friends joined us after a bit because they came looking for me thinking that i had left after being gone for such a long time.the interesting thing was that i had ordered a burger earlier in the evening and was one of the best i've had in awhile. fries were a little overcooked but the burger was delicious with cheese, bacon, and some sort of cranberry chutney on it. the elapsed time from ordering the burger to receiving it at my table was less than the time it took me to order one beer at the bar with a line of two people and three bartenders.so, overall, this place has extreme potential. cool motif, good food, and good drinks. however, since they are a new establishment, i would recommend waiting a few months for management to train their bar tenders, figure out how to stripe a parking lot, and attach the granite tabletops to the table bases (watch out for loose table tops inside).
where the f-- am i? ----every halloween i always want to do something big, or at least something exciting. &nbsp;this year i was determined to have an awesome, original costume &amp; a great time since last year was a bust (stupid long beach). &nbsp;this year i was researching, researching, researching &amp; found the villains tavern off of someone's suggestion in the talk threads (seee, they are useful sometimes!). &nbsp;first off, v.t. you are definitely different, but a good different. why? one thing, you have some crazy ass drink concoctions. &nbsp;seriously bartender? you're turning my drink into a snow cone? what?! although the specialty drinks that they make are super creative, and tasty, it takes about 20 mins to make one. &nbsp;i think everyone in the bar was sober, but nonetheless <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. &nbsp;back to the halloween crowd--people dress up. i felt stupid wearing my olive oyl costume. if you plan on coming here for halloween, come dressed up...no joke. &nbsp;also, bring a flask, or pre-party because you will stay sober. &nbsp;in terms of price, it's pretty standard for los angeles. &nbsp;parking is valet/ private lot. &nbsp;the crowd is super fun, at least halloween night. &nbsp;the bar is awesomely decorated--especially for my spastic mind. downfall: the bathroom. two toilet's total. yikes. also, they don't serve amf's. what the heck?! i guess i need to class it up...another plus: they booked awesome bands. i felt like i was in new orleans for a couple of <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. &nbsp;the tarot card reader? nice touch v.t.! will i come back? for sure!
i used to think this place was pretty cool, but my friend left her credit card there on a friday night and i went with her to pick it up on a sunday evening. first of all we could not call because the voicemail was full and she had been emailing &nbsp;to inform them that she needed to pick it up with no response from management. so, we looked up the sunday <span class="highlighted">hours</span> and they read 3pm - 1am. so there we go on a sunday evening to pick up the card and the doorman will not let us in because it is a private party. we explain to him that we do not want to attend we just want to pick up the card. he then continues to insult us to say that we are taking this whole thing personal. number one, that is incorrectly said: the proper use would be, don't take it personally and number two when we asked to speak to a manager he said there are no managers here. now you mean to tell me that you are running a private party at this tavern without any leadership? really?! i have patronized this bar many times and have been very <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, but this has turned me away forever and i will let all my friends and anyone i know about this rude encounter. this is not a way to treat your customers.

awesome beer selection and good music spinning. good prices and chill bartenders. came early during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was super kick back. definitely will be back
cool place. one of three actual bars in chinatown, with street parking. i really like the craft beer selection although they ran out of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks fairly quickly. 24 beers on tap? great selection? dude. either way, you'll end up here one way or another, i suggest you come before the hipsters find out. great local beers and flights. chimay trippel, golden road hef, angel city, and a few more that i can't remember. &nbsp;and, it's clean!!! everything you could ask for in chinatown, plus easy parking, no traffic, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 5-9. also, it's right across from my office.
great place to grab a quick drink. i think the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is an awesome deal. i happened to walk in one day on free nachos day. the bartender i had, tom, was very helpful. was willing to make recommendations based on what kind of flavor profile i was in the mood for. very cool.they also offer flights...which &nbsp;keep in mind, can still pack a punch if you're not worried. i'm glad that this hidden gem has decided to make it's home in old chinatown. the neighborhood needs places like this.if the pricing and the service stay consistent, i will definitely return again. i've already gone twice. no complaints so far!cheers!
truly one of the best hidden gem in town as far as bar goes. the vibe is very chill, great selection of beers, and there are plenty of restaurants around if you get hungry. now, i'm giving this place a 4 stars because of two things: 1) the music is way too loud 2) cash only. nevertheless, i highly recommend people to check this place out especially during <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> or after <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, whichever works best for ya :)
i liked the old melody lounge, a divey beer+wine place with cheesy lights on the karaoke stage... but i love the new melody lounge!!don't let the drab exterior fool you. yes, from the outside it looks like a two-door garage in the suburbs &nbsp;but trust, you will be very pleasantly surprised once you get your foot inside the door!beautiful interior - dark wood, bamboo detail wall paper.cozy lighting - charming constellation of dozens of red lanterns overhead give off a soft glow. thoughtful furnishings - cute rustic stools with low antique-style chinese tables. comfortable upholstery along the walls. the beer selection - i kid you not, at least 30 beers in this place! they have a lot of local breweries which i especially appreciate - eagle rock, angel city, noble ale works, hanger 24 etc etc and they are constantly rotating and updating their selection!!pricing - the best part!!! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beers from $2.. and a very <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> indeed seeing that it goes from 5pm-9pm!! highly recommended for a quick drink by yourself (no shame), hanging out with your friends, or a chill date.
there need to be more bars like this. &nbsp;those red lanterns holy cow.i have never had greater respect for communism.on one visit here i got a discount on beer even though it was not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i was treated to cujo on the plasma screen. &nbsp;the owner (?) looks like one of the actors in that movie.another interesting visit was on reggae night, which makes me wonder if melody has a lot of recurring events. &nbsp;some of the lanterns were not lit but still plenty of maomao communism to go around.also the bathroom is pretty cool looking - probably worth mentioning because some bars have really awful bathrooms.
what a hidden gem... super cool interior with red lanterns hanging and well done lounging area with cool little tables and stools. beautifully done bar with amazing collection of vintage beer cans displayed throughout. the beer selection is impressive and for those that are on a beer budget they do offer tecate! the bartender was a doll and we ended up staying for more than one beer because we had so much fun talking to her and even chatting with other people wandering in. extremely friendly atmosphere. even a good place to have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> beer by yourself, it's my new favorite spot! cash only but there's and atm and parking out front on street. in the heart of chinatown!
hit this beer bar with my friends/relatives last night and had a great time. cool vibe from staff and the dj (actually, kj--karaoke night, but cool). excellent selection of draft beers with a till 9pm <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. within close walking distance of my favorite c-town chinese restaurant, &quot;full house.&quot; if you are rolling through l.a. it is worth checking out for great beer (figeroua brewery! yeah!) and a nice vibe. the bathroom is dark with candles. i thought they were going to start a seance in there :)
came here with a friend that lives right around the corner. around 6-8pm on monday and we were the only people in there for the majority of that time. so we got a chance to talk to the bartender who had a lot of different recommendations on what to try and even what beers to mix together. he gave us the noble naughty sauce milk stout with coffee mixed with the strauss peanut butter stout. what a dangerous combo! it tasted so good. i could definitely drink a pint of that easy. also tried a lot of the other beers on tap before ending up on the pumpkin ale. hey it's october. i had to. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is until 9pm which means $1 off pints. my beer was $5. plenty of beers on tap to try. i think there were around 20 when we went. and plenty of bottled beers and ciders as well. as for the ambience. it's dimly lit. clean. lanterns on the ceiling. a few tables and benches along the wall to chill out at. very laid back atmosphere. i heard it's super packed on weekend nights but if you're in the area on a weeknight and looking for some great beers to try i would recommend this place.

this is one of my favorite stops before a dodger game!there is a plethora of amazing beers to choose from at reasonable prices. no corkage fee during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (monday-thursday 4-7). the staff is incredibly knowledgeable about the beers.you can bring in outside food (pizza place next door) and enjoy a great beer with your friends. there are board games to pass your time. &nbsp;also, there is a drawer filled with notes left by other customers, that's fun to sift through every now and again. all in all, a great stop!
great little spot to try out some new beers with friends. stop by and check it out. $2 corkage fee per beer, if you stay and drink there. a huge selection of beers from all over the place and a very helpful and friendly staff.they also have a no corkage fees for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which is nice, and a pizza joint right right store too.
absolutely love this place, cannot recommend it enough.yes if you're looking to get crafty and make your own six-pack, this is the perfect beer store to do it. but i absolutely love the bar aspect of it. you get to peruse and pick a bottle/can of beer from hundreds and hundreds of different kinds of beer from breweries. there's a $2 corkage fee for every beer (beers can run anywhere $1.50 and up). so it ends up being a really good deal, great way to try new beers, and a fun place to hangout with people. they have a little patio and have a bunch of board games to play. ideal place to day drink and depending on the people, a fun date-idea.they have '<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>' monday-friday 4-7pm where there's no corkage fee. a great place to stop before or after a dodgers game.also it's byo-food...so you can bring you own stuff, or even order delivery and enjoy you food inside.
may be the best west la beer hole-in-the-wall since tda. all bottles are sold individually - perfect for when you want to try 12oz of a pricey brew without committing to the whole pack. the tap bar is limited, but well curated.great selection, decent prices and corkage free <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> mean you can open a bottle and have a seat in their cozy bar after searching through the shelves.if you are the kind of soul that searches in agony at cap n cork, trying to decide what bottle to choose, then you may know peace here. you can sit down and just try them all.
so glad this place exists. sunset beer company is always my first stop when i go beer hunting. i usually just make quick stops in the bottle shop during the day, and haven't had a chance to hang out in the lounge area yet, but it looks like a great place to hang with other beer folk. i've been on a mission to try a different beer everyday, so i'm thankful that they have such a wide selection of loose cans &amp; bottles. i've tried some wacky stuff here that i would likely never have committed to a 4/6 pack of elsewhere. staff is very helpful and friendly. it's actually surprising how many people work here, considering the size of the space. this would be a great place to bring a friend to split a bomber. $2 corkage fee is very reasonable. waved during <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> too. my only complaint is that it is tough to find parking. they have a very small with only 2 dedicated spots. both always seem to be full, it has 1 entrance/exit, so it's a pain to get in and out of during busy <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, and street parking is not always available in the area. other than that, this place is a local treasure.

i love this place. great wines, and you can tell the staff is passionate about them. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a must.
i absolutely love this place. so chill, no pressure <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i even met the owner. definitely will check it out again.
i went there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> wine ($5/glass) was really good. the food was good too, though a bit slow. it seemed to take forever for the woman next to me to get her cheese plate.
loved this place...they give you popcorn when you first arrive and let you try their wine for the night! we went in 2 minutes before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was over and the girl was super nice and told us that she will give us more time to look at the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and then come to take our order..that was very nice of her because other places don't do that. their sangria is good and strong! only 5 bucks on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!...all of their dishes are really good!
amazing service, wine and food selection. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>... was absolutely that... <span class="highlighted">happy</span>! try the mac n cheese and the papitas... td4!!!!
awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! very cute and trendy place. definitely want to go back!
good selection, solid <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, board games, movie and trivia night. &nbsp;10 out of 10. &nbsp;would bang.
complimentary bowl of popcorn? check. free sip of wine? yes, please! pour haus wine bar is a wonderful place to spend <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on any day of the week. i came here on a friday around 5 o'clock for drinks and eats with two of my friends. this is a hidden gem in the arts district that exudes a cool, calm ambience. they have a wonderful selection of wines and beers alike. our group absolutely loved the lambrusco which complimented the meal. we ordered several food items off of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> meal. greek nachos? solid choice, but nothing fantasic. bruschetta? so yummy! oxtail sliders? melt in your mouth heaven. flat bread? pastry puff delight!our group was so impressed with the service, food and drinks. after 4 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> appetizers and 6 glasses of wine, we found our bill to be a steal of 54$. this place makes you leave here satisfied and wanting more.
great selection of wines. super friendly, knowledgable staff. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is healthy and filling!
we come here often for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. this is a great wine bar and they have a variety of craft beers. their menu is good and always consistent. we will keep coming back for more !
always a blast here. truffle popcorn, free sip of wine when you arrive and great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you can also take your dogs on the patio which is just lovely.
great service. &nbsp;delicious 'truffle butter' popcorn and a nice ambience at night. &nbsp;kind of a dull place during the day (and their &quot;brunch&quot; specials leave much to be desired), but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in the evenings is fantastic.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> bites &amp; drinks for $5! and damn good bites &amp; drinks on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu to boot! in addition to the complimentary wine pour + truffle popcorn when you get in! pour haus, you had me at complimentary. i love this place! the bruschetta and oxtail tacos were delish! the complimentary pour was sooo good. the truffle popcorn was fresh &amp; flavorful. i gots to come back for brunch.
small, cute, great wines, great small foods, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. way better than the wine bar that used to be here. always mellow.
really 3.5 stars. &nbsp;great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: free popcorn and trial of wine. &nbsp;ended up with a very nice sparkling red that i really enjoyed. &nbsp;the space is cool and the service is pretty good. &nbsp;tried the bruschetta and charcuterie. &nbsp;a bit disappointed with the charcuterie, as the portions of meat and cheese were dismal. &nbsp;the bruschetta was, however, great! &nbsp;overall a good place to enjoy <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but the food could be a bit better.
ordered red wine samples from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, all the wine tasted great! their flatbread white pizza was really yummy!!
this is an excellent place for a girls night. it was the perfect place to have a glass of wine, munch on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> items, and actually be able to hear each other speak. when you first arrive, they give you a small taster of wine and free popcorn. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was great and we really enjoyed the flatbread white pizza and papitas bravas. the oxtail tacos however were disappointing as they were unnecessarily oily. i literally squeezed oil out of the tacos. for dessert, we had the warm chocolate cake, and this caramel pudding. both were delicious and the perfect way to end our meal!i think the only disappointment was that a couple of waiters and waitresses that came by took wine and food that was not completely finished. they took it so fast we didn't have time to ask for it back. to be fair, it was almost done, but we definitely wanted to finish our wine/food completely.otherwise, i had a very pleasant time at pour haus!
i really like this place, they have a great selection of wine and beer and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food is very good. relaxing place to go hang out after work!
love this spot. my second time in here and still had the same amazing experience as the first time. great customer service and great wine selects. also <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4-7 with great eats, great wines and good people.
pour haus has a wonderful <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>- one visit and i am a fan for sure. they have a nice selection of wines, beers, and cheese, airy and open (yet indoor) seating, and are super friendly (and provide complimentary popcorn to munch on with your wine!). food-wise, we tried the pepitas (well received) and the bruschetta (lightly seasoned, very simple) and we were <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with our choices. i would love to see a few more food options on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, but i guess wanting more is a good sign! future plans include a return trip to try the oxtail taco, or even better for brunch of dinner.
love this place. &nbsp;the menu is really creative with lots of healthy options. &nbsp;the staff all seem to really know their wines. &nbsp;makes for a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> option. &nbsp;and half a block from biscuit co, toy factory, and brick lofts.
oh my goodness, i can't speak highly enough about this little gem! i went on a saturday night around 5:30 or 6pm and it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> until 7! great deals! the service was flawless! the manager poured us some different wines to taste here and there. we asked about a cab and he said he had a delish full bodied merlot blend that wasn't on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but opened it for us anyways (and at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price)! so good! we snacked on the oxtail tacos and flatbread artichoke pizza. yummy. we even got free popcorn! it was so nice and relaxing. everyone was super sweet and they even had board games for us to play! we chose scrabble :]we will be back in a heartbeat.
3.5 starsman, i was soooo excited to try this place and i was so disappointed when i was meh about it. :(parking: 2 hr street parking right outside until 8pm, then no time limit for the rest of the night after 8 pmcame in during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4-7 pm) and ordered 2 things: greek nachos &amp; potatoes with a creamy chipotle sauce on top.wine: 4 stars! great selection of wine options, including a flight of 3 wines for $12... great deal! lots of different wine selections, will definitely come back for more wine! food: really disappointed but i really do think it might be because i ordered the wrong things... but i guess for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price, i shouldn't really complain but the food was pretty plainwill give this place another shot and hopefully order the charcuterie &amp; tacos next time and will report back! 3 stars for greek nachos &amp; potatoes
a true gem. stopped by for a drink before dinner elsewhere and ended up having a couple of glasses of wine and appetizers. what a find! great service, awesome appetizers. during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, can get a white wine or red wine for only $5 a glass. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> appetizers were also reasonably priced. couldn't stop talking about it the next day at work, can't wait to go back and next time it'll be the main event!
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (4pm to 7pm) at this place is the best. &nbsp;$5 dollar wine by the glass....but the best is the cheese and meat plate. &nbsp;8 items for $25 (i think). &nbsp;what an awesome deal cause the cheese is really good. &nbsp;i will be visiting to get <span class="highlighted">happy</span> again
love this place so much! i always bring new friends here for their great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and wine! the truffle popcorn is enough to keep me coming back over and over!!!we came upon trivia night and that was so fun!great place to chill, have good food and be able to actually hear people.recommend the smore dessert or the crepes were big and great for sharing. tried the grilled cheese one night and it was just ok. love the white pizza best!
me and my mister managed a date downtown for a grand sum of $20, including tip! how's that for frugal? many thanks, pour haus, for rewarding our <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of perambulations with a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> wine and scrabble bout!pour haus has that typical poured concrete urban look to it, with high ceilings and the typical urban hipsters dudes pouring the vino. there's a nice little patio for your imbibing pleasure if you've brought along your pooch or it's one of those sultry los angeles nights. adjacent to this is a garden where they clearly grow some of the produce used in their gastronomical creations.twas quite nice to be greeted with a sample our (just a wee taste) of their sparkling offering for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, a lambrusco. i ended up getting the regular red, which was just a basic glass of red, nothing remarkable, but hey, it was a $5 glass of wine in a cool, clean environment, so i have no complaints. we were also greeted by a nice bowl of truffle cheese popcorn, which the mister devoured with much gusto. he was even offered a second bowl of aforementioned popcorn.a plethora of board games provides many options for mental engagement. my poor mister, thinking he could defeat me in scrabble just because he bingoed out early in the game. what can i say? he's a novice at few things, but scrabble is definitely one of them.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is daily from 4 - 7, and you can select from a red, white, sparkling or a beer for just $5, plus there were an assortment of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> priced bites you could also try. there are some vegan things on the menu as well, but we did not partake...
i'm not much of a wine drinker but i can still appreciate this establishment. the atmosphere is very modern and relaxing, reminds me of new york. enjoyed the soppy joe sliders, small bites at a fair <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price. also, they have quite a few local california craft brews in bottle for all you beer drinkers like me.
i attribute any weight gain in 2013 to pour haus.i come here wayyy too much. my weekly &quot;meetings&quot; here involve 3+ glasses of red and at least 5 bowls of truffle popcorn. that popcorn. i swear it's actually crack. i've tried a couple food items (bruschetta, oxtail taco, flatbread) and all were good but nothing wowed me like the popcorn...so i just eat infinite amounts of it and wash it down with $5 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> reds. i'm sure they're losing money because of me but whatevz.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> till 7pm daily...though they keep having all night <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> gaah so bittersweet. also the employees are awesome and the outdoor courtyard is adorable. it's a great place to meet up with friends but also totally kosher to sit by yourself and read a book.
really enjoyed my <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at pour house. we were immediately greeted with a complimentary taste of a sparkling red and a small cup of truffle popcorn. &nbsp;lucky for us, we arrived just in time to take part in the $5 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;we opted for the bruschetta (heavy on the garlic...the menu described) oxtail tacos and more of that delicious sparkling red. &nbsp;the oxtail tacos, though deliciously tender, really lacked flavor. &nbsp;some salsa, tapenade or plain ol' hot sauce would've given it the kick it was missing. &nbsp;from there we designed our own charcuterie plate with 2 cheeses and 2 meats, surrounded by cornichons, guava compote, dried fruit, &nbsp;honey, nuts and olives. charcuterie plates make me very <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. :)there was a trivia game going on in the bar, that we all managed to get sucked into, as well.i will definitely be back, pour haus. :)
this place is too cool. &nbsp;i took my girlfriend here for a pre-birthday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;we tried two wine flights and several other wines as well as a bunch of food. &nbsp;everything was great. &nbsp;even when we didn't like one of the wines, they replaced it free of charge without issue. &nbsp;my favorite part is they have tons of board games to keep you amused. &nbsp;we played bones (dominos) for a few <span class="highlighted">hours</span> and just enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere.
what a little hidden gem in the hustle and bustle of dtla!<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $5/glass (select wines)$5/appetizers (select ones)simply amazingi came here yesterday for a girlfriends birthday - we were a group of 9, arriving just as <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> started (4pm)!we got seated outside (which i was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> about since the weather was nice). we quickly grabbed our favorite board games (yes they have these for free!) and sat down, only to be surprised with complimentary sparking red wine and cheesy popcorn - such a treat!we then got a bottle of that same wine for the table and picked out almost all of the <span class="highlighted">happy</span> house appetizers to try for the table. we ordered: noshes, small artichoke/onion pizza, the potatoes (sorry i forgot the name!!), bruschetta, greek nachos, grilled cheese and soup, and grilled veggies. i have to say, all the food was delicious (except the soup, which they said was tortilla soup but looked/tasted more like pea soup!) don't expect the portions to be big, but the quality is good and it comes out hot!the service was great too, this russian lady was helping us (i think she was the owner maybe) - she was super nice and tried to make sure we had everything we needed! she had a great staff as well.if you're in dtla, and looking for a place to grab a glass of wine and sit back and play some games with friends, this is your place!
i absolutely love this place! an amazing hidden la gem! &nbsp;affordable and excellent wine selection. they also offer beer and soju for you non winos. <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> is every day from 4-7. brunch $6 or bottomless drinks for $20. they have a verity selection of board games one can play and cute outside patio one can enjoy!
a new favorite. i recently visited this wine bar a couple of weeks ago after work and i am definitely a fan now. it's a small place with a pretty decent selection of wine and beers. the food was veggie friendly which i appreciated and also pretty good. they have a sweet <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and even board games you can play with friends to make for a fun night. did i mention free street parking as well?
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with my co-worker and loved this place. cute little spot tucked away in the outskirts of downtown. we found some street parking really easily. there are a ton of board games inside if you want to play some and they have a cute little patio on the outside.it was a beautiful day so we opted for the patio. they bring out a complementary bowl of popcorn for you to much on - and always ask if you want to refill it. yum! they also started us off with a complementary tasting of wine which was really nice as well.since we were just there for a quick <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, we opted for a flight of wine sampling. i went for the white and it was realtively cheap i think $10 or $15 for 3 wines - which isn't bad at all. i liked just about all of the ones i tried. we also went for their greek nachos which were great. definitely nothing like regular nachos but they tasted good and healthy!
i used to be a regular here when i was working in dtla, almost at least once a week. i miss those times. im a little far now from both work and home, pour haus cant be no longer my week bar. but id love to recommend to anybody who are near.perfect alittle cozy wine bar with great ambiance, friendly staffs, nice little free first rambrusco, cheese platter, outdoor seating at the patio for sunny <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, nothing can go wrong. just a little warning tho. if you are new to the area, don't freak out. you are not lost, you are at the right area. it can be alittle too ghetto but you know art district. you bump into couple bums shouldnt be any surprising. park confidently but close to the bar and run into the door! you'll have a great time there.
pour hous is not for the poor....that's if you and your friends like to drink a lot! the venue is really cute and cozy. &nbsp;during the summer the patio is a perfect location for evening drinks after a long day at work. the free popcorn is great, especially because you end up getting a drink to compliment this savory treat. &nbsp;the food was good, not great but good enough for the price. i came for brunch with a group of friends and i will say, i could have done without. &nbsp;there are way better places for brunch. &nbsp;the food was decent but the drinks were just lacking. i recommend this place for a nice, quick and cheap <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work.
pour haus is in a cute little one block stretch in the industrial area about a half a block away from church and state. there's not a lot of street parking so park in the parking lot across the street, it costs $10. don't try to find street parking more than a block away because the neighborhood gets a little dodgy. you will be poured a glass of lambrusco right when you walk in and brought a bowl of popcorn. there's only a few spots outside, and about eight tables inside. we went on a sunday afternoon at 3:00 and there were plenty of places to sit. this was right in the middle of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> where they've got great specials. glasses of wine and small plates for $5. you can also do a wine tasting of three different lines for about $12 or you can buy a bottle for anywhere from $24 for the lambrusco up to $80 for higher end wines. we ordered the bruschetta and added on the additional burrata cheese and the greek nachos. both were delicious but if we had to pick one we both would've chosen the bruschetta. the staff was super friendly the ambience was relaxing we would definitely come back
a big group of us went here for a friend's birthday brunch last year. the place is cute, not very big, but they were able to seat us all inside at some high tables. they have a large selection of games to play, so we enjoyed a couple games of cards against humanity. those were the positive points. i don't know how their dinner menu is, but avoid the brunch here. they do offer bottomless mimosas, but we discovered that they were very watered down. this wasn't just conjecture; one of our group who got there first ordered a mimosa, but they misunderstood and didn't realize he was planning to do the bottomless deal. his mimosa was significantly better than what we were served for our entire meal. put it another way: we ate and drank from about noon until 5ish, and none of us had more than the slightest buzz. fail. the food also ranged from mediocre to just terrible. a couple of us ordered the tortilla soup, and it must have been the worst tortilla soup i have ever had. there was almost nothing in it! chicken? that's a joke. they hardly even added tortilla strips. the mac-n-cheese was paste-y and lacked flavor. the croque monsieur was just average. the only thing that saved this meal was our fun group of friends. the games helped distract us from the &quot;meh&quot; food and drink. i've been back once since then, when friends chose it as a meeting point for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i guess the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> isn't that bad, but there are so many better options in la.
this wine bar is so quaint and charming! i'm a bit hesitant to write this review, as i want to keep this place all to myself! great service, as well as a great selection of wines. (ooooh, the malbec!) &nbsp;the ambiance is super chill and cozy. the perfect place &nbsp;for some tapas and wine! this little gem is so close to my work, so i might be here frequently for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
excellent selection of wines, cheeses, and other gourmet foods at reasonable prices!don't miss their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, 4-7pm. wine and apps are $5! can't beat it.staff was super friendly, we had to rush out to see a movie before our food was ready and they gave it to us to go, free of charge! very kind of them.
i love this place. the ambiance is unpretentious and super cute, the wines are fantastic, the owner totally knows what she's doing, and the staff is always knowledgeable and super friendly. they don't push anything, and take you seriously if you want to understand what you are ordering. &nbsp;the nibbles are super yummy, love the cheese selection, and the patio is adorbs. totally great choice for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ($5 glasses of vino) but the flights are so good and so reasonable that coming at any time is a great option.
great place to hang out for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i loved the huge beer selection and nice size wine selection too. &nbsp;i love that it has a bar area &nbsp;with also tables and chairs to gather with friends to play some board games or have some of their fantastic tapas style appetizers with your drink. &nbsp; it's not big inside it's a comfy small size pub like feel to it with the dim lighting. &nbsp;it's away from the busy la down town crowd, &nbsp;we hit this place before taking off to see the laker game, great stop and would do it again on our next trip to the game.
lively neighborhood spot. &nbsp;very cool that they welcome you with a complimentary snort of lambrusco. &nbsp;excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals and very generous pours, however, the oxtail tacos seriously left something to be desired, the popcorn was kinda stale, and the $5 beaujolais didn't seem to be making anyone very <span class="highlighted">happy</span> (i think the wine was a little too warm). &nbsp;i did, on the other hand, enjoy my $5 viognier very much.
omg! &nbsp;i heart this place. i found pour haus wine bar when i was scouting a place to throw a party. &nbsp;what a find! &nbsp;its cool and casual and inviting. &nbsp;they have a beautiful wine selection and yummy snacks and food to chose from. &nbsp;i am especially a fan for their cheese selection. &nbsp;they give you a complimentary bowl of delicious truffle oil popcorn and a splash of bubbly red wine to welcome you! &nbsp;such a lovely touch. &nbsp;they offer wine flights and a nightly <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but even regular pours are reasonably priced here. &nbsp;i recently booked the place the for a party i planned- hosting about 25 people. &nbsp;the owner worked with me to chose the perfect menu and drink options. &nbsp;the catered food was fabulous and the wine and service was great. &nbsp;everyone loved it and raved about how adorable the place was and how much they enjoyed the evening. &nbsp;they even let me bring my own decorations. &nbsp;i really couldn't have asked for a better place. &nbsp;everything was perfect.i love to just drop in here any night of the week. &nbsp;i recommend this place for a night out with friends or just you and your favorite wino. &nbsp;pour haus wine bar is truly a great option!cheers! xo
on the increasingly inaccurate industrial in downtown in one of the many charming warehouse brownstones one will find pour haus. &nbsp;poorly named, but fully stocked, it is downtown's arts district answer to a wine bar. &nbsp;a small pour of wine 'to start you off' is a nice touch and a useful <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> offers $5 wine, beer and food specials keep the good feelings going. &nbsp;5 small cookies can be yours for $1 and while not the best cookies, they will cost you the smallest bill in your wallet. &nbsp;and hey! the popcorn's free. &nbsp;opted to for two wine flights ($10) one white, one red which netted me three pours brought out whenever you finished the last. &nbsp;i was especially impressed with the beer selection and the charcuterie / cheese plate options were rather daunting in a good way and priced incredibly well. &nbsp;again thank you downtown la.
a decent wine bar.my friends and i stumbled upon this place after a recommendation from a friend. my friends and i usually like to order a bottle wine. this establishment is different in that they do not have a wine list. they have their bottled wines showcased against the wall and you just walk over and look at the wine and pick one that you like. the prices are on the bottom of the bottle. they have a fairly decent wine selection. the staff was extremely friendly and nice. they also gave us our space without giving us the stink eye even though we ended up staying there for awhile. some of the things that makes this place unique are their complimentary truffle popcorn (which is actually pretty good), a free tasting of one of their dessert wines when you are first seated, and the fact that they have boardgames. kind of weird seeing board games at a wine bar but it was quite entertaining. my friends and i ended up playing cards of humanity... not a good combination while drinking wine... haha :)the downfall was their food. we tried a whole bunch of their appetizers off their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu (<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> daily from 4-7pm). we tried their greek nachos, oxtail tacos, mac&amp;cheese, slaw salad, flatbread, sloppy joe, and smores. the food wasn't bad but it wasn't particularly good. all of the dishes were average at best. with improvement on their food this place has potential to be awesome!
cute little place in the industrial area (dtla), quite hidden. &nbsp;i would have never of thought that someplace like this existed in this part of town.came here after work around 6pm weekday. &nbsp;not many people at all. &nbsp;got served with complimentary glass of wine right as i walked in. &nbsp;awesome, especially after a long day of work. +1wine: great selection. good for hh. $5food:bruschetta - this dish was probably the best out of all the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> dishes. &nbsp;should have gotten two plates of these.cheese &amp; charcuterie board - good. can't go wrong with this.tacos - decent.flatbread white pizza - dish was small. it was bland, no flavor. &nbsp;dough was off. shouldn't have ordered this dish.greek nachos - not what we expected. flavors didn't go to well together. probably come here for drinks, but not for their food.
pretty cool little spot near the art district/ greyhound station...came here to check out the wines, since my gf loves her wines. &nbsp;so its $10 bucks for 3 tastings. &nbsp;otherwise you can buy a glass of wine at $7. bottles were going for $20-25 each. &nbsp;they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and glasses go for $5.food is also available. not a big menu. didnt try the food, but menu looked promising.service was spot on. &nbsp;as soon as we sat down, our server came over with a small bowl of popcorn plus we both got samples of one of their house wines.all in all, good little place that needs to be checked out.
perfect place for wine; it's always a good sign when you're greeted with a tasting portion of wine (the selection of the day) upon sitting down. &nbsp;a friend and i came here not too long ago for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, for which they have some pretty great deals.we came on a thursday and i really thought it would be busier. &nbsp;there was only one other party that came in during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which is surprising considering the quaint atmosphere of the place. &nbsp;i like that they &nbsp;have board games - i think it would be really fun for a larger group, especially considering how barren it was in there.my biggest knock on the place is the food. &nbsp;maybe we caught them on an off day, but the truffle popcorn that they served (both before and right after they made a new batch, remember we were pretty much the only ones there) had a stale texture. &nbsp;the flavor was good, so i ate it... but apparently i'm a masochist because each kernel was chewy on the outside and almost hard in the middle, not crispy like popcorn should be. &nbsp;we also ordered the greek nachos, which again was fine flavor-wise, but the presentation was definitely lacking. &nbsp;it looked like something i could have made at home (i'm pretty sure they made it in a toaster oven of some sort). &nbsp;it came with the foil underneath and the cheese looked like just regular store bought cheese that they heated up on top. &nbsp;at least it was cheap since it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but i really don't think any establishment should serve food like that at any time of day, regardless of price.i'll probably try it out again to give it another chance since i do like the vibe, but probably not for a while.
awesome awesome wine. &nbsp;very cool ambiance (dim lighted, sophisticated yet clean looking), great and friendly service, and more importantly the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 4:30-7pm on weekdays rocks. &nbsp;there is a limited food menu that basically complements the wine, but nothing hearty enough to fill you. &nbsp;we ordered 3 dips with pita bread which consisted of an asparagus sauce, a tomato type sauce and a hummus. &nbsp;all delicious. &nbsp;thankfully they are now having food trucks every thursday and friday. &nbsp;ludotruck (check ludo lefebvre's fried chicken truck) was the first truck to step up to the plate and park next to le pour haus. &nbsp;(delicious chicken). &nbsp;you can also buy full bottles of wine and i believe they are decently priced without the huge markup.great environment to catch up with a friend or a few friends. &nbsp;right next to church and state.
super good. &nbsp;4.25 stars. yummy snacks. &nbsp;the top of the &nbsp;free popcorn was stale, but they made more soon after arrival. &nbsp;the service was great. &nbsp;the wine flights are generous and reasonably priced. &nbsp;the brownie bites were great and i loved their selection of cheeses. &nbsp;the waiter/ sommelier didn't know the food well and the cheese plate was stingy with the fig jam and truffle butter. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> seems like a great value, so we'll be back for that. &nbsp;loved the recommendations for wine to take home. &nbsp;great service all around. &nbsp;will be back while in town. &nbsp;enjoyed their board games, but bring your own if you are a serious gamer. &nbsp;they have yahtzee, scrabble, connect 4, etc. &nbsp;no settlers or 7 wonders :0(. seattle's card kingdom still tops the games, snacks, bar list.
holy crap. &nbsp;this is dangerous.first of all, the area is so freaking cool. i love this part of downtown, semi arts district, semi industrial. this little stretch of it, specifically, is super cute with church &amp; state right nearby and a few other cute establishments.pour haus was easy to find, and it was the perfect post opera stop. &nbsp;we posted up at the bar at around 11 pm on a saturday night and got two flights, both were incredible. the wines were super fabulous, there was a great dj spinning some tunes, excellent service and pretty good food. we got the kale salad, the oxtail tacos (they're small, get a few), and stuffed mushrooms. &nbsp;the wines though. seriously, some of the best i've ever had at a wine bar. &nbsp;we coasted through our flights and then ordered glasses of wine that we loved from the flight. and then we bought 5 bottles of wine. epic fail for the bank account, epic win for our tummies, our tastebuds, and our marriage.i love this place and recommend anyone who likes wine and the downtown area to check this out. one of the best discoveries in a long time! can't wait to come back for trivia, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and their monthly wine educations that sound incredible.
$10-$14 wine flights available!! we came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> when they have wine specials, no food specials, but we thought the flights were a better option---they started us off w/ a complimentary taste of the lambrusco (carbonated red wine) yum! we almost bought bottles to take home w/ us!---free popcorn while we were perusing the menu, too bad it was stale---4 for $14 cheese/charcuterie mix n' match plate: comes w/ sliced baguette from bread lounge, crackers, fig jam, dried dates &amp; cranberries, green &amp; black olives, mixed nuts, cornichons, &amp; i think apricot paste... &nbsp;no charge for extra baguette!.. my favs were the tallegio &amp; robiola cheeses... but they didn't have too many to choose from---enjoyed my rose flightnote: place was cute but completely empty when we came! wine bottles galore on display &amp; for sale! i noticed a stack of board games on the side.. i wonder if you can play these...
a few travel blogger friends and i decided to meet-up at this place. i love this place! great wide selection of wine!! pour haus is in the arts district in dtla the place is difficult to find as it is tucked away in the very small street on industrial street. after making a few turn arounds i finally found the place. i found parking at the street as it was early enough. at night though there is a paid parking lot you can park at. we went on a saturday during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. wine and appetizers for half off- great deal! lots of food selection but i would have to admit the food was a-ok ( -1 star for that) but a few are good for vegans and vegetarians and light-eaters. other than that the wine selection is great!the crowd is as diverse as it can be. artsy, hipster looking, and older crowd, diverse is best! our waiter was awesome! so friendly and took care of us. a++ for customer service. i have been recommending this place to the rest of my friends.
while the receipt still says swill automatic, this place is definitely a new wine and beer joint in the arts district. as i scoured for parking on a tuesday at 6:00 p.m., i found that the best option was to pay to park. i thoroughly enjoyed giving my car to a valet who then moved it 30 feet into a slot for me. parking gods 1, me 0.seeing as how many people seem to really like this place, i will highlight what i was critical about during the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> visit. what i found slightly concerning, to begin with, were the prices. while the arts district boasts a very kitchy and higher-than-average food scene, i felt like pour haus could have been more competitive. they have plenty of wines and a decent beer selection at good prices, but i feel like their price to quantity ratio is off. i suppose we should have figured out how hungry we were, and how large the portions were. either way, we had to order more and paid a little bit more than expected.greek nachos: while i saw these as a hot mess, they were actually quite stuffing. the nachos were basically toasted flat bread with lots of yogurt oozing off the sides like ninja turtle slime. i recommend this for those who want to fuel up.the mix n' match standard: i am not sure if i really liked this platter, as it seems to be the thing people order while sipping on wine, yet it's not really a filler-upper. it's a great conversational group of items that you can snack on without looking like a slob, but you'll probably be disappointed with the lack of taste in cheese, jams, and olives. this is only worth it if you're trying to impress someone, or coming here to snack.stuffed mushrooms: very much like stuffed eggplant, you'll note these will go quick. they are, however, oily.oxtail taco: probably my favorite dish in the whole place. now this is food, and i'm <span class="highlighted">happy</span> i found it here. the beef will fall apart as you try to eat it, and it will ooze with flavor as you bite into it. consider wearing a bib or black shirt. or just eat it in a corner.while i suppose the dishes are best for 2-3 people or that individual plates may be the way to go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i would hope that their beer selection increases the next time around to more than what has now become traditional ipa and light (stone, stella, racer 5, etc.). although i am not sure about their wines, i can recommend that you certainly try the oxtail tacos above all other things, and take your time to park. you may also want to note that the noise level may be higher on weekends, but for a tuesday night it was great. i hope to be back here again, with better knowledge as to what to order so as to get the most out of my experience.
hidden gem. found this place on a yelp search for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot since just recently moved here. place was great - service excellent, wines/beer were very affordable and food was delicious. will definitely be going back and would recommend this place to anyone. perfect for date night or meeting friends. there is supposedly an outdoor patio too but didn't see it. next time!
pour haus wine bar is located in downtown la. it was rated &quot;best downtown <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; by la weekly. they pride themselves in fine wine, craft beer, and gourmet food. the moment we entered we were greeted immediately. then another server asked to check our ids. she seemed rather stern at first but later on grew to be friendly. their menu is mainly of a tapas style cuisine ranging from french, spanish, and meditteranean that changes throughout the year. interesting subheadings on the menu including noshes, snacks n stuff, the precursors, the substantial, and the finale. their happiest <span class="highlighted">hour</span> menu is only $5 per dish. choices on their happiest <span class="highlighted">hour</span> menu include bruschetta, oxtail tacos, greek nachos, pizza, veggie grill, papitas bravas, noshes, dips &amp; pita, grilled cheese and soup, and bowl of mixed berries. they also have lunch specials and a brunch menu.their wine menu has a pretty good selection including flights of the month, rhone varietals, and bordeaux varietals to name a few. our server started us off with a sparking red wine from the happiest <span class="highlighted">hour</span> menu. popcorn was also served on the table. i also tried a red wine which was rather smooth with some tannins. later on, i had a sauvignon blanc which was slightly acidic and sweet. we ordered some food from the happiest <span class="highlighted">hour</span> menu. the oxtail tacos were okay, even though they were meaty it was still lacking a bit of flavor. the mac n cheese was good although it could have a bit more cheese flavor. the dips and pita were also good, i liked the red pepper feta dip the most as it had a little spice to it. all the dishes arrived rather promptly.they also have a great selection of games on the shelves. this includes cranium, connect 4, trouble, checkers, cards against humanity, scrabble, mastermind, risk, and many more. we ended up playing cards against humanity. i won the game because apparently i happen to chose the best cards. parking can be a bit difficult to find. there's not much available unless you're able to park across the street or the streets around the area.overall, i had a great time here. food was decent but the wine and service was pretty good. plus, the games available made it fun too. recommended to go for the wine and games! i'll be back for another visit.
i might have given 41/2 stars, but it leans more to 5 then 4, so there ya go.  this place is reasonably priced and has a good selection of wine(you can purchase it too!). i love the truffle popcorn, whoever complained about it being stale....it is tossed with truffle oil, so no it probably wouldn't be crunchy, but hey...it's free and quite tasty. i love that i can buy a pretty good bottle of wine for less then $25 bucks! and you get a free tast when you first sit down!  really enjoyed the charcuterie and cheese platter and the zucchini/squash salad. the mac and cheese is hit or miss, great flavor but occasionally not thick enough. riblets are good, always tender. hummus dips are yummy. and we aways get the smores to finish up our meal. the menu definitely plays to a more shared or tapas style.  terrific beer selection, it changes a lot. and their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is fantastic! i think there is a dj on the weekends.trivia too! don't recall the night it is, but it's a fun crowd.
i really just wanted to see what all the five-star fuss was about. i enjoy the softer side of the drinking scene: &nbsp;small, quiet, low lit, romantic places where you can actually go and enjoy the company of the person you're with. &nbsp;that is le pour haus. &nbsp;located on a one-way street in the middle of industrial downtown los angeles outskirts, the tiny wine bar is just perfect: for dates, for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, for a light snack, to enjoy the flights, to banter with the friendly wait staff.the menu is pretty impressive, and i liked that if you chose a wine that was for sale (yes they have bottles of wine lining the walls that you can pick from), they would un cork it for you and you have the option of taking the entire bottle home with you. there were three flights to choose from, i picked the $10.00 australian flight:taltarini lalla gully reisling (white)hesketh &quot;usual suspects&quot; shiraz (red)killakoon killerman's run sauvignon (red)for snacks we had:peppadew pepper poppers: stuffed with goat cheese and chives, prosciutto and provolone.ribblets: pork ribs in a house blend of seasonings.the peppers were an interesting taste, served cold in olive oil, it was a bite that burst with flavor. &nbsp;the ribblets were also quite tasty, when they were served on the bone, i initially thought &quot;oh, no....&quot; but the meat just fell off, it was tender and nothing you had to fight with or create a mess out of. &nbsp; also a food truck is parked outside that belongs to the bar, so if you got food from it you were more than welcome to bring it inside.such an adorable place, amazing staff (!!) i can't wait to have another date night here!
love this place, it's a total gem. came here last weekend before hunger games yeaaaa at la live. bf and i got here and it was amazing how incredibly shady/ghetto the entire area was but there was just one street, industrial street that was nicer. we got really lucky and parked right outside their door. thank god for my car! cuz honestly very few cars could fit in that space. anyways, parked for free very easily, and walked in. it was pretty empty but it was only 7. (we missed <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> by 2 minutes, sad) we walked in and were greeted by a delicious splash of spanish bubbly and truffle popcorn. honestly though it was a nice gesture, the popcorn was a little stale and not crunchy anymore. (half star off)bf ordered a glass of the spanish bubbly and i ordered a flight of australia for a specific riesling. it was all sooo delicious and great. we ordered all three of the snack plates. one was delicious ribs with the perfect amount of sauce, the second a plate of teeny tiny peppers (cherry tomato sized) stuffed with cheeses in olive oil. the last was stuffed mushrooms which was definitely my favorite. the peppers came second as i normally don't eat any kind of pepper but this was not so spicy/peppery and only packed a tiny bit of heat towards the end. i would recommend all three items though but if you can only get one, cheese stuffed peppers might be a good idea, more unique. anyways the wine flight was just delightful, the pours were generous. the lights were dim and perfect for winding down (especially after suffering from tension migraines for days from stress at job) they have board games and bottles of wine for sale, priced reasonably. service was also great and our server very friendly, but i took half a star off for letting my glass be empty for too long. i finished off my first pour but had to wait a bit until i made eye contact and flagged him down to get my second pour. next time, i plan on going when i'm not in such a time crunch, wear comfy clothes, order a bottle and sit down to beat my bf's ass in board games.
pour haus is a fun place in dtla. as soon as you enter, you're greeted with a complimentary tasting of wine. i'm not a big wine drinker, but the house sweet wine of the night was delicious. i forgot to ask what it was, but i was pretty set on having beer for the night anyways.their beer selection is awesome. they have a huge chalkboard wall full of choices that will satisfy even the pickiest of drinkers. not sure, ask your waiter, they can give you the 411 on everything offered and what they taste like.for food, i had one of jerome w's oxtail tacos. they came in a serving of five and had a good amount of spice to them. the bruschetta was pretty amazing with the bread being nice and toasted served with a big pile of tomato and garlic goodness on top. on the menu it warns you that they are generous with the garlic - and they aren't kidding around. my breath was probably kicking after that bite.for my own eats, i got an americano sandwich that had short rib and a horseradish cream sauce. it was well worth the price and they didn't skimp on the meat. i'm not usually a fan of horseradish, and it wasn't too overpowering and i actually enjoyed it. the best way to describe this would be that it's like a great grilled cheese with meat that has a spicy kick to it. i'd order it again.service was great. the guy taking care of us was attentive and always asking if we needed anything else and clearing glasses/plates almost immediate after they were emptied. even with a big group, everything went smoothly!parking is sorta difficult. if you get there early enough, you can find parking nearby, otherwise be prepared to take a little hike through some not so fun parts of the neighborhood. it's pretty close to tent city, so there are a lot of homeless people, which is fine, but you'll probably get asked for money every five feet.there is a valet parking lot across the street for $8... i was being cheap and didn't want to pay. be careful with the $5 valet that's nearby, it closes at 10pm. luckily the man was nice enough to let me know and that i should park my car elsewhere.all and all, i had a great time and would definitely come back and recommend to friends that were looking for a nice spot in dtla! they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during the week and can accommodate large parties of people, just call ahead and let them know you're coming!
what a great spot! &nbsp;we stumbled upon <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ( i thought it was just during the week). &nbsp;i started with a glass of napa sauv blanc recmmended by owner, lorena (delish-i bought a reasonable priced bottle). &nbsp;my friend got the soju mojito, and she loved it. &nbsp;we split the plata tapa.....which was a bunch of small bites (nuts, dates, dried cranberries, cheese/crackers/salami, a couple stuffed peppers, and olives). &nbsp;we also got a 6p crostini that was tasty and freshly made. &nbsp;then i moved to a glass of the malbec and we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. &nbsp;the stuffed mushrooms were incredible.....we got 2 orders!! &nbsp;i ended with a glass of cava any my friend got another mojito. all that for the bargain price of $53. &nbsp;a great little gem. &nbsp;definitely out of the way if you are not in the neighborhood, but so worth the drive. &nbsp;sophisticated, clean, and classy. &nbsp;i loved the vibe here and felt like i could have stayed for <span class="highlighted">hours</span>. &nbsp;great job lorena!!
the-little-easy-los-angeles-2
great place for a date/drinks/dinner/maybe even dancing. the cocktails are strong and the food is tasty. it just needs a little more seating and a better <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
i came here with a coworker on a tuesday night for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and it was pretty much empty. there were a lot of option for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and food, but dont' expect to pay <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. they were really expensive. i don't think there was a drink on that menu that was less than $12. otherwise, the quality of food and drink were really good. we had the mac'n'cheese and the debris fries. they were amazing, but just too much for us together. if the prices were a little bit more reasonable, i would want to come back. but, it's not really worth the cost.
definitely a great addition to dtla. you have to float to the back room. i've been there a few times now and the drinks are phenomenal plus i'm a sucker for new orleans style cocktails.this is my second time eating there and before i had the jambalaya this time i had the kale plus the red beans and rice. i am not sure if that was the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but it was $5 for each one- amazing!!!!it's on 5th &amp; spring and for sure its a hit.
came afterwork for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. definitely hidden spot and you would never think it was there considering all the weirdness going on around. as in weird people. it's close to the metro line so that may be why? i ordered shrimp tacos, which had nice flavor but the shrimp inside was very tiny. my friend ordered shrimp po boy which was a good size. she said she liked it. we also ordered beignets with lavender chocolate sauce the flavor was on fleek! super delicious! i would definitely try this place again the atmosphere is new orleans vide. i almost was tempted to try out the swing on the porch. lol. maybe next time.
effing amazing. &nbsp;i wouldn't geaux on a friday or saturday night, but it's a kick-ass change of pace for weeknight <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;legit food, authentic beverages and a disneyesque vieux carr&eacute; courtyard at the end of a crazy corridor in the back. &nbsp;thankfully, it's nothing like the douchey pretense and overpriced-yet-underwhelming fare at not-so-nola inspired royal (n&eacute;e five0four) or p&amp;p. the only way to make it more realistic would be to bring in some southern frat boys, naked titties, chinese-made trinkets, garbage, lucky dogs and hand grenades. &nbsp;on second thought...
the choice to go here was very last minute, and was the last stop to a great day of exploring la:)we got here right at the beginning of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i can only rate this place according to their bar at the front, and was not able to experience their food and unfortunately their live jazz music as well!i had the sazerac. i am a fan of whiskey and cognac based cocktails, and thus, this was a great drink to have and given the fact that we were at place called little easy (big easy aka nola) and it was a live jazz music joint, i thought it was a good time to have that cocktail. first time having one, and the bartender did a great job. it was strong, but made well enough that i was able to taste the other ingredients which included the orange peel, bitters, and of course the cognac. i had a craft beer that was tap as well, which was legit. so they get stars for have some decent crafts on tap!! my friend had the alcoholic root beer, which i thought was very sweet, but not bad!overall, the service was ok. i will be back to check out one of their live jazz nights. i was told this is usually on tuesdays and thursdays. this place definitely has potential to be a &quot;hidden gem&quot; type of bar. i recommend this place to all, especially if you like jazz music, which is hard to find in la.
fun place, went on a &quot;chubby tuesday&quot; (every tuesday except mardi gras). &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all night made the prices more in line with what i expect. &nbsp;(16 bucks for shrimp and grits is a little hard to swallow). &nbsp;ambiance was excellent, staff was friendly, the band was good, the back bar with the fountain is very comforting. the build out is beautiful and simulates the french quarter, but it's almost too nice, too precise. &nbsp;they need to let the cleaning lady go on vacation for a while till you get a little of that stale beer and vomit smell that encompasses new orleans (but hey, it's nice to eat in a place that feels really clean too). &nbsp;the bartender was friendly and knowledgeable on the menu, but she had never visited new orleans. &nbsp;note to the management, once you find your core staff that sticks with you, you should fly them to new orleans for a little team building exercise.the band took my request even though they were ready to go home, and really made the evening feel like home, and they could really play.and they can make a good sazerac.i got loud and boisterous and they not only tolerated me but seemed amused.the catfish po boy was deeeerrrriciouus, and the leidenheimer bread was the icing on a perfect piece of fish, just how it should be.it felt like home.
love it here! i was a little skeptical about it when a friend suggested we go here based on the fact we we're only going to go because he had free drink tokens, lol. but turns out, this place is the bees knees and i love it here!if you're not looking up while walking on 5th, you'll miss the sign. but the big indicator is the security guard sitting out front on the stool. the front is modest but when you walk in it feels like you're somewhere in new orleans.. or at least that's how i felt. i can't be 100% sure since i've never been, hahaha! there's the bar area with about 10 or so seats if you wanna get intimate (so to speak) with the bartender or just there for a couple of after dinner drinks. but for those of you with larger parties or wanting to get intimate with your date, there's another room in the back.tuesdays are all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!! you're welcome. i know that's the real reason you're scoping out the reviews baby. ;) $2 off all beverages.what i came for and highly recommend: booze &amp; beignets!! i wasn't too enticed over the set cocktails list but ask the bartender for their recommendation or let them know what you like and i am pretty sure they can make you something that fits your taste profile. or i am just incredibly lucky?
darling newish bar that feels equally downtown and french quarter. big tacky drapes, oil portraits and chandelieeeeers. nice and spacious when you walk in, and a labyrinthine corridor leads to a courtyard with a gurgling fountain. they have live jazz three days a week, more like a diversion than bona fide entertainment, but no cover, and it's good. so is the food. the blackened catfish tacos were amazing, the best fish tacos i've ever had. red beans and rice were good, but i was hoping for classic dirty rice like zatarain's. these were more spanish style with a brisket based sauce. debris fries were like waffle fries poutine, the closest thing to the real thing i've had outside of canada, with yummy pan drippings. cocktails are about like what you'd have on bourbon street. i got a sazerac, not a hurricane. p&amp;p wins for frozen drinks, outdoor seating and a late night food <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but little easy is more fun to get drunk in and has better food and service. i love kat the bartender, who also works at the love song bar.
osso-dtla-los-angeles
enjoyed: interesting space, great menu, awesome fried chicken, beaverdusa punchmeh: empty, saying there's a &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; is misleading, incredibly low lightinghit up this spot on a thursday after work hoping to catch their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but soon found out that there really isn't such a thing. no drink specials and i was promptly informed that the kitchen doesn't open till 6. if you checked out osso's website and saw their &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 5-6pm tues-fri&quot; just know that that's a lie.i do have to say that i very much enjoyed the cocktails i sampled, which was the east 180 and beaverdusa punch. between the two, i lean towards the herbal-strong beaverdusa.in regards to food, my party ordered:* beef biltong: good, but made me want the real thing.* onion rings: decent and came with a sesame dipping sauce.* foie gras torchon: decent. osso's jam was a nice addition.* wax beans: very much enjoyed this dish, though the served portion could have been larger.* hamachi crudo: personally, i felt like this dish was over-complicated and neither the pho broth or basil made any noticeable impact on the taste profile.* fried chicken: awesome. this was actually a surprise, but that may have been due to my open expectations. nicely seasoned breading and incredibly juicy meat.beyond the food and drink, i was incredibly surprised that my party was one of just two groups in osso the whole night. i think that their food definitely deserves stronger patronage, but maybe it's their location or that they're new? if you're considering to check them out, i'd recommend satiating your curiosity with a visit.
osso, a vulgar latin word for bone. perhaps this place wanted to be a rib joint. oso, is spanish for bear, which could be a typo as the place is truly bare. the menu on flimsy paper has an image of a rat sired by a beaver and sprouting snakes from its head. what does it all mean? oh, so who cares? this spot is located in the warehouse district which is seedier than a bird feeder. park in back and maybe no one from the third world medical center will belly ache after 5:00 pm. two <span class="highlighted">hour</span> parking on the street and hope they leave the fancy lug nuts from your beemer. is this a bar with snacks? well, yes. is it a serious restaurant with a small cocktail program. yes, that too. the place kinda doesn't know what it wants to be as if chaz bono came up with the concept. the interior is your basic industrial shabby chic and has all the atmosphere of the last scene in a &quot;b&quot; crime thriller where the former alcoholic detective does mortal combat with the serial killer russian drug lord. you know the look, concrete floors, plaster missing to reveal the former incarnation. you have entered the world of noir dining. the place is large and opens onto the street with a commanding view of the roadway overpass and prime seats for the sharks rumble with the jets over turf. of the four snacks they were 86 on two of them. i was resigned to a bowl of house made salt and vinegar chips. they got hoovered before the drinks appeared. no matter, just order more. the hola chingo was cimarron tequila blanco, lime, blueberry cordial (very aussie, or make that very osso-ey), and bubbly wine all in a frosty tall glass. i'll have two and someone please hail the uber driver.there are seven listed &quot;cocktamologist&quot; signature concoctions, a small list of craft beers, and a minuscule wine list. no worries , you'll find something interesting. the menu too, is small but the kitchen is all business and very serious about what they are sending out. the chilled wax beans with dill kefir, candied almonds, and smoked cured yolk was unusual &nbsp; and unusually good. tart, refreshing and as summery as the perfect picnic. after that, the eatin' got down to real business. the patty melt would have made john montagu, the 4th earl of sandwich, smile so wide his whiskered lips would've been touchin' his ear lobes. house baked rye bread, thick juicy beef patty, caramelized onions, cheddar and swiss and served so hot and melting it needed oven mitts to hold it.next came the fried chicken. brined, buttermilked (probably), and fried so crisp, biting into a that moist breast might crack all those crowns you're still making payments on. is this the best fried chicken in the city right now? yes, no question. (sorry ludo.) all the competitors will just lay an egg next to this version. worth every nickel of the $35 for a whole bird. dessert? bring cookies from home. maybe this place opened up for the staff to enjoy, and they do and if you like it too, that's a plus. the servers aren't professional but they are willing, genuinely outgoing, welcoming and <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to please. you want full service, a somm, a large menu close by? hoof the 7 blocks to bestia and beg. you want strait ahead, down home, no foolin' really good grub, you've arrived. note to self: 20% is automatically added, so ave your change for the parking meters. the note is prominent on the menu and they tell you up front. take a lesson maude...which which requires a jewelers loop to read the fine print. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; funky neighborhood, small limited menu? no matter, osso, is oh so good.

this is a great bar. i went in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a tuesday. everyone is really nice. they played david bowie and had lots of vinyl albums. they're aces. next time, i'll go at a more populous time. also if you have verizon lte, expect a lack of signal, inside.
my wife and i happened to come across this place thanks to the instagram page 'happeningindtla'. we had such a good experience here. i highly recommend it. the bartender, nathan was top notch and so friendly. they have a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, very good drinks and great food. we will definitely be back.
whilst searching for a fun <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot to visit with mis amigos, i came upon the love song bar in a yelp search. thanks, yelp! i am <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to report that the love song is hipster heaven just south of skid row, gentrified enough to feel completely safe, but still gritty enough that it's not a scene (yet). the setting is vintage and unique (i so hope they keep that upright piano in use every once in awhile), <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are decent, and bartender is friendly. he seemed a bit off his game the night we visited, but it wasn't disastrous or anything. just sort of a having to order twice and then getting the wrong drink kinda thing. it didn't bother me: bourbon is bourbon. the seating is ample and comfy, lots of pillows. definitely a great spot to hit if you like to drink in a low-key and cozy setting!
it is sure nice to see broadway undergo a measure of revitalization. &nbsp;the creep has been slow, but really apparent as of late. &nbsp;the love song bar is a notable outlier on the street, and a fine bar. &nbsp;it expectedly has the hipster vibe with young bearded fellows about, and an old school <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu with drinks based on your grandparents' favorites, and at pleasantly reasonable prices. &nbsp;the d&eacute;cor is a juxtaposition of cool, turn of the century wood bar on the right, complete with deer antlers, and an almost mid-century feel of green lounge on the left. &nbsp;oh, and the bar has a nice collection of vinyl in lieu of a jukebox, where you can select an lp and play it on one of their turntables. &nbsp;bring your own if you like... &nbsp;the folks there have none of the pretense apparent in some other bars staffed by the lumbersexual types, and are simply welcoming and friendly. &nbsp;hit them after four for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and enjoy five dollar cocktails. &nbsp;oh, and don't miss the chance to check out the wallpaper in the men's room.
i remember reading about the love song bar on la eater and making it a point to come check it out one day. my friends and i were walking along the street on a friday afternoon around 4-5pm and spotted love song and we decided to go in. the place is on the small side but very very cool! great leather booths along the side with tables and the bar is along the left.we happened to come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (yay!) mon-friday from 4-7pm. we had two rounds, beers and cocktails and just hung out and played chess. good beer selection on hh and the cocktails were on the strong side. super comfy, with pillows, not crowded so we could stay a while. more people did show up closer to 6-6:30pm.bathrooms are in the hallway between love song and prufrock and you can see the huge indoor stage!

came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;great place for the price!
$3 brownie during the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was worth it.
awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, love this place after work!
great meeting place! great drinks! and wonderful customer service!we chose everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu! and everything was delicious! cocktail drinks are pricey even for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but they make them strong.i would recommend for the ambiance! and everything it has to offer.
great place! &nbsp;great drinks, good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the appetizers are perfect snacks especially the wasabi fries.
go for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! i recommend the ming wings and wasabi fries. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are a deal and a half. extensive beer and whiskey list. &nbsp;their bar area is chill and the patio is dope. heard their regular menu items are good too, but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> stuff keeps me <span class="highlighted">happy</span> and keeps me coming back.
great bar! great food! service is a little slow when it's busy but that is understandable. this place is great for a good time in little tokyo! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too!
been here a couple times.. though only for sunday's all-day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;good service, nice outdoor seating, and wide selection of beers. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food was good gastropub cuisine.can only, but would recommend sunday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to anyone looking for a good gastropub.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here rocks! in my opinion, the bees knees is the best cocktail on the outdoor patio <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. we started <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> indoors and moved out to the patio after a drink. they had a different hh drink menu outside, not sure why. love the patio area, super chill and cute. the sliders were ok. my friend liked her burger and wasabi fries. the hostess was extremely friendly and the server was ok. server inside was way more attentive. i'll definitely return for the drinks and cute atmosphere.
this place has an awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and they have a great beer selection. the ambience is very mellow and sundays are the best to come down
a really cool spot downtown. great food, and an even better <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. you have to hit up the sunday all day <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the bartenders were great and the atmosphere was chill. i will be back, often.
love love love this place. have always had a good time here. wasabi fries! you must get. they make good cocktails. i had an old fashioned. come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. before 7pm! there is an indoor bar with tables and tables outside with a dj.the bartenders are friendly and cool
cute place, especially for an after work <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with coworkers. really like the back section outside.
nice alley converted to outdoor sitting area. my coworkers come here many times. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is very nice and the ambience is great
the food is delicious for the price that they charge. i wish i came for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the drinks are expensive if its not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i had a great time with my friends.delicious food! wasabi friesfar bar burgerming wingsshrimp tempura rollbacon fried ricestreet parking or valet parking. no free parking.
omg what a gem in little tokyo! my friend and i were seated outside and did i love the atmosphere! i love the red-brick-east-coast apartment alley-esque vibe &nbsp;the servers were really kind and patient. made the lunch much more enjoyable~i had the b.l.a.t. burger and my friend had a tempura roll. both are very filling! the burger was cooked well and freaking huge. my friend had a cocktail and it had rum and pineapple and nutmeg? it was quite delightful! i had an ipa and you never go wrong with it.they don't have <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> on saturdays &nbsp;but their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu seems solid! definitely pay a visit during their <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>!tldr: look out for wasabi fries and <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>
this spot is quite a hole in the wall. i came here on a sunday and it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, how perfect. we sat outside, which had a chill atmosphere especially with the hanging lights. for two, we ordered the wasabi fries ($2.50), ming's wings ($5), and cheeseburger sliders ($5). the fries were good although i'm not a fan of wasabi so i didn't particularly enjoy the sauce. it was subtle so i still ate with mixed with ketchup in the sauce. the wings were dusted with spices and they were good sized pieces. as for the sliders, they were the least flavorful on the menu but it came with nice presentation of the three little burgers. i like the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing on their menu though. i also had a moscow mule ($6) which was good, but i wish it came in a tin can as it should. i like the environment of this place and would be back for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu.
great hidden gem in korea town. atmosphere is amazing at night, and you can't beat the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
family and i decided to have a nice out in la and my uncle mentioned far bar for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. this hidden bar is a place i'll definitely come back to! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great. finally tried the yetti. ;) and their bar food is actually really good. my cousin and i split the blat and pb &amp; j &amp; b burger. the pb &amp; j won my tastebuds over. so delicious !!! service was good for being understaffed.
sorry far bar....raising prices on the same mediocre food and taking one of the best items off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>? sadly we won't be back. the service is underwhelming and too many other options in little tokyo.
this place is ok...better to go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. beware! the online menu prices and in restaurant menu prices do not reflect the actual prices! we showed up on a sunday for &quot;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; which the website claims &quot;4pm-close&quot; that's false. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 9pm-close. we found this out once we got there. our total bill came out more expensive than the prices on the menu...shady. i've been coming here a while but my last trip here was shady. can't say i'll be coming back soon. the food isn't bad, pb&amp;j&amp;b burger is great, drinks are pricy. i like the outside seating area, cool ambiance, just watch out for the sudden price changes on ur bill that don't reflect the actual prices on the website or the menu in the restaurant. how are you supposed to know the actual prices?? maybe somewhere down shady st, and get ripped off blvd.
through a hidden alleyway, this far bar is a hole in the wall / gem. <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> are excellent here as well. they have an extensive beer/spirits menu. good food, great vibes... what more can one ask for?
kings win!!!came here for king's victory game on friday.park by fu-ga, only $5 dollars.awesome place to watch sports.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is a pretty good deal.$3 - sapporo drafts $4 - pork tacos - pork was very soft and flavorful. the slaw on top added a nice crunch.$5 - ming's wings - the wings were crispy and seasoned well. would come back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> again!
good place to go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! in a little alley in little tokyo with string of lights to keep it festive. rolls and the famous wasabi fries are some recommendations to try.
my wife came here with some co-workers for some <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks &amp; liked it so much, she brought me here a week later. we came to sit outside on the patio in the back, which is well hidden. you must walk down a narrow, dark walkway in between two brick walls to get there. the normal eye would never know its hiding back there, unless you're a basset hound, but once you find it, you'll be glad you did. the patio is littered with lights hanging between the brick buildings. it has a relaxing ambience thay doesnt try too hard but it certainly has some cach&eacute; if youre lucky enough to find it. &quot;you tell a chick you been someplace it's like bragging you know how to find it.&quot;the inside bar is nothing much to look at. its literally a hole in the wall. but if you keep walking to the back, past the bathrooms, the adjacent bar seemed cool. lots of people relaxing, reading the paper or chatting it up with each other. anyway, i digress. back to the patio for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they had a variety of options with good prices. spicy tuna $5, cheeseburger sliders $5, wasabi fries $5. we tried them all and loved them all. but the topper that sold me, hook, line &amp; sinker were the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> old fashioneds ($7). they really know how to make them. i was pleasantly surprised because i am really picky about my old fashioneds. they use buffalo trace bourbon, which i have seen but never tried, but they definitely made them the right way. plus their moscow mules ($7) were classic too.i am rarely in that area, especially for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but i will definitely make it a point to return.
fantastic location. the far bar is behind this narrow little brick alley and entirely outdoors with simple white lights strung across in the air. awesome <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices for everything from well drinks, to asian beers, to $3 for a huge plate of wasabi fries and numerous other food items i can't remember. $6 bacon old fashions. really friendly servers! oh, and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on monday is 3-close!!!! other nights <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends at 7pm. the only thing that prevented them from being 5 stars is the servers were a wee bit slow, but awesome!
try the burger with wasabi fries for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! show your metro card for a 10% discount!
the food here sucks. no sugarcoating that. the 3 stars is for the bad food/good vibe combo. hit up the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and chill in the alley outside. cute place to hang out.
the samurai burger!!!whiskey all around!! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!cool vibe! cool little alley way entrance!!what else can you ask for!?love this place!
cool bar in little tokyo, down the street from the gold line metro stop. if you're in the area stop by for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. good drinks, good bar menu. i'd recommend the moscow mule, spicy tuna rolls and the hot wings. make sure you catch the metro back before midnight.
great relaxing, peaceful scenary. decent prices on drinks and the wings weren't bad. the service was the best though. a fun place to be for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
try this restaurant for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the pork tacos are scrumptious and flavorful. &nbsp;the korean shirt ribs are ok, but the wasabi fries are very good. &nbsp;they also makes great, fresh mojitos.
i really like this place especially for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. totally worth coming into dtla area for. the service is great and ambiance is casual and diversed. &nbsp;the chicken wings and wasabi fries are delicious. i usually try and find street parking or park in the lot nearby for $6. it's a cool spot to meet up with a friend or two and catch up.i definitely plan to go back. i just wished their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was until 8pm. that would be perfect!
we came to this place at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it was pretty busy and loud. we had some sliders sushi and wings. the sushi was...well...it was not bad ...but not very good...the sliders were boring and not very special... i missed the nice taste. the wings were fresh made but without any taste ...it tasted like they were just fried with garlic without giving anny spices. well im not sure about this place ...the service was very good everyone was frienldy and i like the spot and the atmosphere but im not sure about the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food so ill rate it 3 stars.
good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and the service was not fabulous, but for the amount of people here on a monday night, the was no excuse. food was good and drinks were strong! &nbsp;a ok in my book :)
far bar's $7 wasabi burger is the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal in a few mile radius. &nbsp;big juicy burger with wasabi fries makes me a frequent, and <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, customer
had the california roll in tempura batter. it was so delicious. great drinks, great food. perfect little spot for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink and bite to eat.
good place to get wasabi fries! very yummy. $3 for a side of wasabi fries. we came during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so i wasn't sure if that was the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special or not. you can get fries along with a burger for $7. good price for beer as well.place is a little hidden, in an alleyway in litty tokyo. you have to walk through the alley to the back in order to get to the place.
forgettablei went here because of yelpers' gushing reviews about the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i was at the far bar on a friday night. &nbsp;i had a $13 pear cocktail - for that price, i was not that <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. &nbsp;i also had some red wine. &nbsp;my waittress seemed more intent on chatting with her coworkers than keeping her customers <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> offers a basket of fries for $3; order that, which is the foundation for a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp; be sure to order wasabi on the side. &nbsp;i have no idea what the management were thinking when they serve fries with sauce drizzled on top; &nbsp;fries are meant for dipping. &nbsp; i also had the crab cake sliders which were okay but needed some sauce - maybe some chipotle mayo or thousand island. &nbsp;why go here when little tokyo offers so many other choices for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>?
fun place to hang out after work to wait out traffic. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is a great deal. the bacon fried rice is fantastic!they have a full on whisky bar and a huge selection of bottled japanese beers and craft beer.
look for the sign &quot;far bar&quot; and an open door, that leads to an alleyway between two small stores... down the alleyway is the restaurant far bar.when you find it, definitely try their far burger and wasabi fries together ($7 during <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>) and it's amazing!!!their burger was thick and juicy, and their fries were crispy and the sauce delicious, though messy.their ming wings and their sliders were good too. i recommend coming during their <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, some of their appetizers are $3- $7. and their drinks are cheaper too (thus, <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>).i'm definitely coming back here... just need to find parking and the venue itself.
love this place! we recently dined here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and everything was absolutely delicious. i recommend the wasabi fries, cheeseburger sliders, and they also have a burger that has a tuna patty and ginger. so good.
the service has gone down hill.. so much so that i have just about stopped coming here or suggesting this to friends as a place to check out. it's nearly impossible to get someone to wait on you, check in on you or refill drinks. they also took the far bar burger off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, which was my favorite, consistently prepared well and a great deal! i guess i just can't find any reasons to come back... sorry far bar!
another bar that i frequenti really like their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>~on sundays and mondays, starts from 3 til closing!and the other days (tues-friday) only 3pm-7pm!wasabi fries - its offered on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu! i recommend you to order it. so good. especially their wasabi aioli? and its only $3 during hhcheese burger sliders - self explanatory. decent for hh price!garlic buttered edamame - well buttered with garlic, indeed. pretty good~ ultimate bacon fried rice - one of my favorite dishes here. comes with egg on top! pretty goodi've tried their burgers couple years back and i remember it being good!
-sunday night review-what's best about sunday besides the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, it's quiet and chill here! not exactly happening, but i love that you can meet a friend here and simply catch up!<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>sunday/monday all day tues - fri 3-7pm$2 off asahi, kirin$1 off all beer (including my favorite espresso stout)$2 off of liquor hh burgers m-w $5 burgersi would say the best night to come catch up with a friend is monday with hh all day and a &nbsp;$5 steal with the burgers!
i'm rounding up because the patio is so great. perfect for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or a chill evening. pretty good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and extensive beer selection. the food is a little hit or miss, some items are very good like the wasabi fries and the wings but some are just ok like the mac n cheese. i tried the bacon old fashioned expecting something infused but it was literally a slice of bacon resting in an old fashioned.
i love everything about his place in little tokyo. the fact that it had access to the metro gold line makes it very accessible for people in different places is la. one you go through the allley you get an great bar that has an awesome atmosphere, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food and drink menu.
you can enter thru a super narrow side entrance in between the buildings and you'll find great little spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. stopped by to watch monday night football. had the hh $5 specials: pork tacos, spicy tuna roll, &amp; dumplings along with a $3 sapporo draft. all excellent and delicious! jack the bartender was very accommodating and attentive. great customer service. highly recommend and will definitely return.
loved this place...quietly tucked into a little alley way in jtown...great food, good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices and even better dranks.
amazing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the appetizers they offer during that time are delicious and a great price. beautiful place, looking to sit outside next time i'm here. 2 drinks, 2 appetizers i left with a bill of $11 and happily drunk :) and the staff is awesome btw
i love this bar-a group of us went here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a warm summer night and it was great. plenty of great choices in food-we had wasabi fries and sliders and various shared plates. the house wine was cheap at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and not bad, but really it was the setting that was great. it's unusual to sit outside in little tokyo and not be right on the sidewalk. i haven't eaten inside yet but maybe once &quot;winter&quot; comes i'll give it a try.
okay-- to summarize:- great outdoor ambiance- fun electro music - good drinks- fun bartenders- delicious <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (chicken wings, garlic wasabi fries!)- super close (to me)i'd like to think of this place as &quot;my local bar&quot; :p
great location. perfect mood for a date. sunday and monday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> all day long. great food and wings. really nice place to hang out. great part of dtla , love little tokyo
go here on sundays, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is all night and the sapporos, old fashions are really kick ass. &nbsp; great fresh sushi and live band. &nbsp;i love this joint.
service was awesome and the waitress definitely knew her alcohol. she recommended me a japanese whiskey that was very smokey, but smooth. she was very attentative and it also helps that she is very good looking.highly recommended if you are in little toyko and looking for a quick drink. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is insane!
honestly at first, when it was mentioned that we were going to a bar in an alley way, i wanted out. but when i peeked through the narrow alley, i was surprised at how beautiful the patio was, adorned with lights hanging from the sky.we came for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, just for drinks. our server was nice and promptly came to take our order. unfortunately, she informed us that they ran out of their bacon old fashion. what?? my thoughts were that maybe they just ran out of the bacon. fair enough. but it was only 9pm on a sunday night! fine, fine i won't get upset because i still ended up with their craft beer of the day: lagunitas ipa, which happens to be one of my favorite ipas. for $4, you can't beat that! everything on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is less than $7! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is tuesday-friday 4-7pm and sunday-monday 4pm-2am. it's a great place to take larger parties or to even have an intimate night. i absolutely love the ambiance and location. tip: it's only a few shops down from daikokuya and morugame monzo! great place for a second stop of the night.
the sunday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> totally redeemed my first experience here. summer 2012, i came and was reluctant to even check in because i had horrible service, rude encounters with the bouncer and hostess, but last night's second chance was well received. the sunday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> has great food and drink selection. last night i had a pretty stiff old fashioned and $5 spicy tuna roll. i even forgot my wallet and was able to pick it up with all money and cards still inside! great ambiance and friendly service, i'll say third time may even be more charming!
i love this place! it's cool and has a great vibe without being too crazy. they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on sunday's and monday's, good drinks and good food. i have yet to try a bad dish here, actually. my personal favorite is the far bar burger- a must try.
from my experience yesterday i would give it 1 star.1. no service. they weren't even busy yet we didn't get our order taken for 30 minutes. 2. we ordered a bottle of cab. took 30 minutes to come out, because they were chilling a chardonnay.... when we ordered a cab. we even pointed to the bottle on the menu, our waiter even repeated the order back3. when we were trying to pay to leave the waitress seriously ignored me 5 times. she was right in front of me. she was too busy eating something. overall far bar used to be such a cool place. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but, what's the point of having a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> when your workers don't even pay attention to the order.
another crowded <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>****************************************there is a huge cool looking &quot;chop suey&quot; sign on the side of this historic building. &nbsp;its probably for the purpose of looking hipster, &nbsp; but i was sort of hoping chop suey would actually be on the far bar menu. &nbsp;its not. &nbsp;darn. &nbsp; the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is pretty decent:wasabi fries: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bpork tacos : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a- (surprisingly good. get pork)mings wings: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b cheeseburger sliders: &nbsp;c+ (not good. dry)the interior design is pretty cool. &nbsp;it preserves the early 20th century feel but with added flat screen tvs. &nbsp;there is also a charming outdoor patio with cool hanging light bulbsbut it gets pretty crowded and that ultimately affects service. &nbsp;living in dtla, i am developing an insidious disdain for crowds, &nbsp;especially for basic bar food. &nbsp; after a tough day at work, last thing i want to do is hassle with crowds. &nbsp; so it will get dinged a star. &nbsp; sorry thats just how it goes. &nbsp;i don't think i will be back for a while.
far bar is always a cool place to show friends who've never been. with it's back alley entrance and stringed light ambience, the bar feels like a secret you're letting others in on. &amp; it's always a good place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> if you happen to be in the area. the star of the menu is definitely their cocktail section, though i usually grab a rotation of japanese beers whenever i'm there. i usually grab the far bar burger with wasabi fries (just for the deal of it) during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> too.though i've been here enough times to taste several things on the menu, nothing has been too memorable. the food is ok/good, not great. i really come here to drink and chill with friends with the game on the projectors in the background &amp; some pretty surroundings. that being said, i wouldn't mind eating here pretty often if i lived closer.
i would have given this place 4 stars if it weren't for the extremely slow service during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the environment and layout of this place is wonderful. there's a really cute ally area that's accessible from the street or from the bar.i will definitely come back to see if the service is any faster.
- craft beers. win.- <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with pint of craft beer for 4 dollars. win.- sexy bougie hipster ambiance perfect for date kinda place. win.- kinda slow service. not really win.- in an alley way. sexy. win.- far bar burger and wasabi fries. oh lord win.
far bar is always my go to place when i'm in need of wings, yummy food and drinks. they have the absolute best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ever!!!! i always ask for my amazing waitress crystal. she is theeee best!! she always makes me feel so taken care of, &amp; it's always truly a blast when i come here.
i love love love their wasabi fries! soooo bombbb!!!! i usually come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but i always have to get a side of wasabi fries. bartenders are friendly and actually talk to you! so that's always a plus! one of my favorite bars in los angeles!
come here on a sunday and order from their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu (which is all day).just get the wasabi fries and the chicken wings (wings are $4, and you get a good amount of them). my god the chicken wings are so good. get 2 orders of those and some hot sake (which is $7)
fave spot in lt. 1) the patio is magical.2) i'm a sucker for hanging lights and brick walls. reminds me of outdoor bars in portland or brooklyn. 3) whenever there's a live jazz band or music...yes. 4) <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is won-der-ful.
short and to the point. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> has changed. no more far bar burger. regular priced wasabi fries have increased in price and over all prices have been increasing. this is due to new management. it is still a good deal but you can find better deals down the block. honestly not as good of a bargain as it used to be. which is sad and might make loyal customers find other alternatives.however, food is still pretty killer and will continue to be my favorite bar / food place.p.s : sean stop changing stuff up!!!! it is good as it is.!

outdoor patio for brunch or <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!this place has a great outdoor patio that gives me brooklyn feels. tempura french toast is where its at. pair with their beer specials and you could chill here all day or night. it has been empty or super low key every visit making it a great chill spot to watch a game or hang and catch up with friends.
the place to be from 4pm-7pm! i love the vibe at far bar... very lax. great place to hit up after work! they have good munchies for super cheap... all ranging from about $3-$5! they even have their far bar burger with a side of wasabi fries on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu for a mere $7, what a deal! i only tried one of the chicken wings and thought it was pretty bomb. their wings aren't drenched in sauce like i'm used to, but the seasoning is goooood; not to mention they have the perfect crunch. now for the important part: the drinks! large sake = $7, sapporo on tap $3! 1 set of those and you're straight for all of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. apparently the guys next to us didn't think that was enough... they got us an order of the bacon old fashioned! thankful they did because i got to try it and it was delicious!!! but what killed me was the rounds of hennessy. really? hennessy before dinner? this would've won me over like maybe a couple of years ago but man i was just tryin to chill on sake and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> turned into turnt the fuck up <span class="highlighted">hour</span> really quick. let's just say i had to take a nap that friday night........... and i didn't wake up until 11:30pm to go out again. haha. fail.
i was late to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, can you believe that?! lucky me, my sisters kicked off the evening and became fast friends with our server before my arrival. i was welcomed with a big smile and a menu. it was clearly past that time but our server graciously said she'll honor the hh pricing on food and drinks for me. sweet!<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: tuesday-friday (3-7) and sunday-monday (3-closing)i had a moscow mule and though it wasn't served in a tin cup, i couldn't be more happier with how good it tastes. no skimping on the alcohol plus for $6, there's really nothing to complain. a couple more of these babies and i was definitely in a <span class="highlighted">happy</span> place.for drinking food, i got their wasabi fries for only $3.50. fries are thin cut and crispy, maybe frozen from a bag, but i don't care because the wasabi dipping sauce was genius. they should certainly work on the portion size of the dip because halfway through the fries, we wiped it clean. ming's wings ($5) on the other hand had a sweet and savory marinade which was delicious down to the bone. &nbsp;being <span class="highlighted">happy</span> on a friday at an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> of <span class="highlighted">happiness</span> in our own little booth, it's hard to whine about anything except, the pace of things could really be quicker in terms of our food and drinks getting to our table. otherwise, the place was bustling and everyone was in good cheer. yay for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
i absolutely love this place!! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is awesome, $4 craft pints, $4, wings, and everyone seems to love the wasabi fries. back to the their beer selection, it's awesome! it changes all the time.
great little bar tucked away. can get a bit crowded and hectic, but great if you're here when it's mellow. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 4-7pm i think every day of the week? i know i came here on a sun, and there was hh. they even had a band performing on sun night. cheap bites for hh.
i'm sure that based on the liquor selection and the regular menu, this place is pretty solid. but i stopped by for a quick <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> session the other day, and i just wasn't impressed. it was extremely crowded on a friday evening, which is understandable. but while i was waiting to speak with the hostess on the patio, some skinny guy with a hipster hat steps in front of me and asks her for a table. it turns out that there was one table top left and she gave it to him, leaving us with the choice to wait or sit at a communal table, uncomfortably close to the people next to us. annoying, but not a big deal.we ordered a few things off the hh menu including the wasabi fries, ming's wings, and the spicy tuna rolls. the wings were pretty tasty and a good value for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but the wasabi fries that everyone raves about were quite lackluster. they were just regular fries that came with a wasabi dipping sauce. i don't actually know the definition of &quot;amazeballs&quot;, but i'm pretty sure that this is not it. the spicy tuna roll, on the other hand, was simply horrendous. mushy rice over stale nori, wrapped around a dark red substance that would be an insult to call tuna. it was literally inedible, but at least the server saw that we left it untouched and took it off the bill. i don't actually think the food here is that bad, because i saw someone next to us order the bacon fried rice, which looked pretty delicious. but the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here seems crowded, unorganized and rushed with mediocre menu items. the next time i stop by, if i do, i'll be sure to avoid the busy times so i can get a better experience of this place. p.s. don't ever order the spicy tuna rolls here. ever.
in love with this place! they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-7pm and the menu is pretty decent. the must thing to order is the far bar burger with wasabi fries. soooo good. it is only $7. what a steal. came here with my gal pals on a friday night and it was packed during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. luckily, we were able to get a table and be seated almost right away. service was good. food was good. parking on the other hand is a huge problem here. little tokyo in general is a hassle to visit since parking is just so bad. but if you are going to venture here after 5pm, i usually parking in a $4 lot on 2nd street next to pinkberry. i will be back here to grab a yummy burger! :d
stop #2 on our...2 stop bar crawl. don't judge me, i'm a grandma.i couldn't find the drink i ordered on the menu, but anything with jalapeno calls out to me. honestly, it was one of the better drinks i've had. i was surprised by the quality of it considering we are literally sitting on patio furniture in a brick alley (ambiance is pretty great though).our waitress was super nice and funny. she requested that one of us leave a credit card because people have been dining and dashing lately. people are the worst!i'd come back for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or a light dinner. good selection of bar eats!
great location. &nbsp;great vibe. &nbsp;great beer selection. &nbsp;need anymore for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> joint? &nbsp;i love that the patio is tucked away behind some buildings. &nbsp;really gives you a &quot;big city&quot; feel in the middle of la. &nbsp;definitely a place to come with people who are out of town, close friends, or a special someone (?).
came to far bar after work on friday with co-workers. we go there around 4:30 and it was not too busy. ordered food and drinks from the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. the food and drinks were great, but the service was not. we would have to hunt down our waitress to place orders, and when we did place orders, it would take a long time to receive them. one of our beers was sitting at the bar for a few minutes before she brought it to our table. i ordered a drink and when it did not arrive in 20 minutes, i had to tell the waitress to cancel it because i we had to go. if this place was to increase their service, it would easily become one of my favorite places for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because the food is amazing, and the drink variety is great.
young downtowners drinking up their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>full bar, mainly outdoor patio seating and a few seats at the indoor bar, great bartenders, jazz-eclectic-electronic.. often times live music
didn't spend much time here but it gets a 4 star so far. &nbsp;mac n cheese balls were fantastic ! &nbsp;i loved their specialty cocktails. forgot what i got but it was fruity and fun. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was good. &nbsp;it's hidden and a cool atmosphere, i preferred the outside. &nbsp;a definite stop for anyone in downtown.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials are awesome. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">hours</span> are sunday and monday 3pm - close; tuesday thru friday 3 pm til 7 pm. &nbsp;items range from 3 to 7 bucks. &nbsp;the $7 item is a hamburger served with fries. &nbsp;i haven't tried it yet but i hear that it's good. &nbsp;things i tried and liked were the tofu tacos ($4), ming's wings ($4) and wasabi fries ($3). &nbsp;my favorite <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink is the bacon old fashioned. &nbsp;basically its an old fashioned infused with bacon but the best part is they use a stip of bacon as their garnish!
worst experience ever. keep going. just keep walking. kitchen nightmare. no drink refills. we kept ordering things and then after plenty of time to make the item - we find out they don't offer it anymore. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>? nope.brunch? nope.half the menu? nope.sushi? nope.
went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and was told at the bar that beer was $2 &nbsp;off, so we ordered beers from a menu on the counter. turns out those beers aren't on special, and were the listed price. &nbsp;really, where can you get decent beers for under $5? i can't stand paying 6 pack price for one beer at a bar! also, yet don't have food specials. not a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
my friend and i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. he got one of the beers, and i ordered pork tacos and wasabi fries. the tacos were great. i was not expecting them to be that filling! the meat was well-seasoned, and there was a good chunk of meat in each one. the fries were great. the wasabi aioli they came with complemented the fries really well. i want to come back here and try the other things on the menu. usually &quot;asian fusion&quot; places kind of turn me away, but this was great!
this place has the best burgers i've ever had! the flavor is like no other, it's so flavorful and comes with grilled onions and some crazy flavorful sauce. the meat patty is like half a pound of juicy heaven in your mouth. come for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and it's $7 for a burger with fries!
cute little spot in little tokyo. &nbsp;kinda hidden. &nbsp;entrance is between two buildings, looks like an alley way. &nbsp;came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. decent prices.wasabi fries - ok. still wanted my ketchup/ranch to go with it. &nbsp;wasabi was a bit strong on the first bite, just a heads up. &nbsp;the french fries were nothing special, seemed like the ones you buy frozen at a grocery store. &nbsp;looks like the mcdonald fries...cheeseburger sliders - good. nothing special, tastes like any other sliders out there.ming wings - &nbsp;the best dish out of these three. &nbsp;would def. get an order of these chicken wings again. cooked perfectly and crispy.great prices for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.but they didn't have the bacon old fashioned available.... the sole reason why we can here, kind of disappointing.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is the reason most people come here and i can't disagree. there's lots of items on the menu that become more sensible between 4-7pm. some of the things we ordered were ming's wings, pork tacos, sliders, and of course, wasabi fries. the fries are the talk of this place but mine got soggy fast but no big deal since i eat pretty fast as well. it was nothing more than another food challenge for me. it's a hidden place so you will miss it unless you look for the red door!
we stopped by to check this place out because we liked it being tucked away in a mysterious back alley on little tokyo. &nbsp;we've always passed by and wondered what it was like...we found out it's ok.the patio area/alley is substantially smaller than we expected, the entire place is in pretty tight quarters. &nbsp;the live music was awesome and the crowd was mellow. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food was ok, nothing special, but nothing terrible. &nbsp;the service was ok.overall, i'd probably go again if a friend suggested it, for the live music, ambiance and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks specials (which was decent) but not for the food.
i love this place. it is my new go-to place for good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and appetizers. i came here last friday night with friends for a late dinner and pre-gaming before bar hopping in downtown la and it was just as good without <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. drinks were a little pricey without <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ($6 for beer, $13-14 for mixed cocktails), but the food was amazing. my friend got a gigantic burger (don't remember which one, but i think all the burgers are equally good) for $8 and it came with fries. it came really quickly and smelled delicious and was absolutely mouthwatering. (during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, it is only $6 for the burger and fries). my other friend ordered the far bar roll, 8 pieces of yummy goodness with spicy dynamite sauce - best combo ever! i shared a loco roll with another friend. it was gigantic and just as good, if not better than the far bar roll. i didn't get wasabi fries last time, but they are delicious too and only $3 during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.last friday was the first time i've sat in the actual restaurant, because it was so cold and windy outside. it was nice to get indoors to stay cozy, but &nbsp;it was very crowded and dark. i prefer the outdoor seating, because it is so pretty with lights strung above and heat lamps beside every other table. i'm definitely sitting outside again when it's slightly warmer!
fiancee and i came for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on friday night and the drinks (moscow mule and a mojito) were just so so. &nbsp;the far bar burger with fries is quite a good deal for a tasty burger! &nbsp;the wings were not my favorite... a little dry for my taste. &nbsp;the last thing we had was the spicy tuna roll... and it was quite spicy. &nbsp;i did enjoy that roll! still a good spot... but it has lost a little bit of its charm.
deliciuous craft beers and $5 gourmet burgers on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu! doesn't get better than that in los angeles. the manager, kyle, is awesome and very helpful when selecting menu items. ps...try the wasabi fries!
great place to watch a game, monday night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> goes all night which is perfect for monday night football. &nbsp;food is ok, wings are tasty, but with all little tokyo has to offer, may want to do food elsewhere
the far bar isn't hidden any more! they remodeled their extended room and put a full bar there with a handful of tvs. a good place to grab a drink if you're waiting in line at daikokuya or to even come during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! one drink that did surprise me was their bacon old fashioned. i'd recommend you try it with a side of their garlic wasabi fries. :)
seriously, why is my beer missing an entire inch? this keeps happening and far bar is quickly falling off my <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> list. careless. instead of having a hostess at the front you might want to invest in better bar staff. &nbsp;waitresses also tend toward dgaf attitude.
cute outdoor seating, the display of lights in the patio area is beautiful. &nbsp;the service is good, and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu is not too overwhelming. &nbsp;they have some good beers on tap at a reasonable price.the far bar burger was good, spicy tuna roll, mings wings. &nbsp;the wasabi fries lack wasabi, but hey it's fries! &nbsp;i love fries.location is great, little tokyo is a fun place to people watch and hangout with friends.
i like the atmosphere. food was ok. you'll probably have to pay for parking which is the case for all places in this area. service was slow. i was with a group and one of my friends literally did not get his burger into the rest of us was finished with our food.kinetic potential is a great light ale.the food is pricey. the far bar stack sushi is $13 is tiny. its like size of a playing deck of cards 2 inches high, with spicy tuna making up only a small part of the top. i recommend if you want to come here, do it during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> otherwise come here for the beers/cool atmosphere and not the overpriced food.
cool, relaxing spot for a drink. large cafeteria style tables/seating in the middle, with more intimate tables on the sides. the bar display is grand - organized, spot clean, and plentiful. bartenders are fast and good-looking. my favorite drinks were the gin-gin mule ($10) and the dottie daiquiri ($10). both refreshing, i couldn't choose a favorite. the gin-gin mule is spicy in a good way, great refreshing kick of ginger and lime! the dottie is creamy horchata-rum drink with specks of ice for texture. i really enjoyed both - the best parts of my afternoon :) we also ordered the downtown sour ($10) - its the prettiest of all the drinks, but too sour/sweet for my liking. i wanna come back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! appetizers start at $5 and cocktails $7!
cerveteca-los-angeles-3
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;fresh raw oysters for $1!
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;(daily from 3-7 pm) &nbsp;the sangria is excellent, the oysters were fresh and delicious, and everything we ordered was very impressive.the ambiance is a cool industrial feel, and there was plenty of parking when we went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.service was excellent. &nbsp;try the mexican corn and the street dog!closed on monday!! :)
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, great food. surprisingly good $1 oysters during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as well. definitely a place to check out next time you're in the arts district.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is awesome!!!! 4-6pm!! can't say no to $1 oysters.. drinks were good too!!friendly staff.. can't wait to go back.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tacos and beer is everything. great crowd. amazing service. such nice decor. i shall return!!
just happened to be in the area at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the portions were really generous and the combination of flavors imaginative and delicious.
this place has a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;it runs from 3-6pm, and the food and drink specials are ample, delectable, and affordable! &nbsp;i love seeing a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu with not only a wide variety of drinks but also enough nosh to fill you up and keep you from getting too drunk. &nbsp;we both got the sangria, which was yummy although not very strong at all. &nbsp;for $5 though, it was fine. &nbsp;we also got oysters ($1 each!), a chicken taco, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger with a side salad, and the chicken wings. &nbsp;i enjoyed everything! &nbsp;the burger might've been my favorite, juicy and flavorful, yum! &nbsp;the space is great too! &nbsp;casual yet classy. &nbsp;perfect for a nicer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;parking, which is always a dealbreaker for me, was not too hard. &nbsp;i arrive around 4:50pm, and i was able to easily find street parking in one of the slanted spots on 3rd street. &nbsp;there were quite a few spaces open too, and i didn't see any signs for time limits, so i assumed it was and open free-for-all. &nbsp;score! &nbsp;plus, with a number of other restaurants and bars within close proximity, this place is great for the beginning of a night of bar-hopping, and maybe even second (or third!) dinner later in the evening! &nbsp;i'll be back!
consistently great food. tacos, amazing. turkey burger, amazing (better than beef actually...hmm!), <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $1 oysters, usually great. just go here, blindly point at something on the menu and you'll be delighted.
fun spot! good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and dammmmnn that chorizo burger is nuuuttss!located in a hidden alley you'll feel like you found one of l.a.'s hidden gems.
went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;had the $1 oysters and the birria taco, and then finished off with some ribs. &nbsp;i recommend all 3. &nbsp;michelada was spicy and on point. &nbsp;sangria was great.
this would have been a 5 star if they had a better beer selection for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (they had pbr and an ipa from angel city), but what can i say, i have a beer bias.great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! i repeat, great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food. (it's from 4 to 7, glad it goes to 7.) the wings were great and it comes with a blue cheese dip, good portion too. the popcorn shrimp was just that, popcorn and popcorn shrimp with butter and a great spicy dipping sauce on the side. the street dog? yum! i don't like yellow mustard, which it had, but there was so much going on with the ketchup and mayo, grilled onions and peppers, and diced tomatoes all topping the bacon wrapped hot dog, that it was still great! but what really impressed me was the dollar oysters. that's right, quality oysters for a dollar at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. they had 3 different offerings at a dollar each. they had a lime wedge and a lemon wedge, ketchup (odd), shredded garlic, and a spicy mignonette on the side.the red sangria that they had for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was great too!this location is slightly obscure but worth seeking out.
great place for a fun dinner. food was great. it won't disappoint. great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the portion sizes are generous. the tables aren't too big watch out when ordering half the menu. good service. the burgers and street dogs were my favorite items so far.
the restaurant is in very cool location in the la arts district. one of my new favorites! the food is really tasty and unpretentious. the staff are friendly. a great experience! highly recommended! btw $1 oysters during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>
excellent environment. the servers are attentive and engaging. my beautiful wife's pickiness was accomodated, thank you chef. the meal was fantastic. i'd love to check out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
listen. as a longtime east-side foodie, i just had to weigh in. holy cow, what an experience. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on sunday. when everything went wrong they worked hard to make it right. #generalmanagerchriswulff. four stars.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. only till 6:00 thank fully i read another yelp review. it says 7:00 on the site. also they feature a lot more items on the online <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu vs. the one they gave you. overall didn't seem worth the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> price. best was the taco but $5 for one? spicy margarita. yes. cheese pot $7 pass. patatas bravas. yes. calamari + nothing special shisito peppers $7 could do without.a lot of tvs playing the game. nice venue. easy early if you find it parking.
i really dig this place. it's very intimate and has a minimal rustic feel to it. &nbsp;i went for the first time on a weekday and just missed <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so i was pretty bummed. <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> ends at 6pm, get there early! my mood was quickly elevated by the quick and attentive service. we ordered the sangria, a barbacoa taco, a fish taco, the patatas bravas and the mexican corn on the cob. everything was delicious! the tacos were perfectly seasoned and made with handmade tortillas, yum! the patatas bravas were full of a light and crunchy, salty goodness. the mexican corn was good, but my local elote man makes them better. the prices are a little high... tacos are $5-6 dollars each.
so far i've only done <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here but i have done it a few times.i live nearby and i was complaining to neighbors about all of the restaurants coming in being too pricey. &nbsp;a few people told me that i should try the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at cerveteca, so i did.$3.00 pabst blue ribbon tall boys.that's enough for me right there. &nbsp;i keep telling restaurants that they should have at least one beer around this price for locals who want to stop in regularly and chat with other neighbors. &nbsp;if your tab (just for beer) is $20 - $30 for 2 or 3 beers, then it's not going to be on my &quot;regular spot&quot; list.i had heard that the tacos were good so i tried a barbacoa taco. &nbsp;at $5 per taco, i thought that was pricey for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;the taco is pretty big and it's mostly meat. &nbsp;it is pretty good but i'm used to the tacos with meat + onions and cilantro, east of the l.a. river for a dollar or a dollar fifty each.the l.a. street dog. &nbsp;$5.00. &nbsp;excellent. &nbsp;bacon wrapped, like a real &quot;street dog&quot; but it's all made with proper ingredients (not like the cheapest you can find stuff that is sold on the street). &nbsp;it has so many toppings &amp; sauces on it i found that i needed to eat it with a knife and fork because my face was just getting covered with ketchup &amp; mustard, kinda like a hungry 4 year old.fried calamari with shishito peppers. &nbsp;$7.00. &nbsp;again, i thought $7 is a bit pricey for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu but i really enjoy this one and for the neighborhood, $7 isn't so bad lately. &nbsp;i have had this one a few times and it's always really yummy.oysters. &nbsp;$1.00 each.wow! &nbsp;i've had these a few times and they've been great.fresh, great taste, great price.i like this place but i don't know if i will visit off of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.my last <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> visit was great but came out to $30 (with tax &amp; tip).
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in all of downtown!!!$1 oysters from 4-6pm daily (yup even on the weekend)!! they've been serving fanny bay oysters which have been decently sized and oh so fresh. patata bravas are also very good.. their version of french fries but a thicker cut with soft, mash potato-y filling. i've had the popcorn shrimp as well which came with popcorn and battered, fried shrimp. not bad for the price but not enough shrimp in my opinion.drinks specials are decent with your beers, specialty cocktails, and wines. the waiters always come by a couple minutes before the end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and ask if you would like to order another <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink. now that is awesome service! i've been a couple times for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and it's been pretty empty. go now before everyone finds out about it! ---parking: free street parking and valet on the weekend. for valet enter on 1st street.
came in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and had a great time with my coworkers! i ordered a mimosa but i can't drink orange juice so i asked if they wouldn't mind using cranberry instead and they were so pleasant about it! i can't wait to come back with a date and actually try the food!
very cute/casual restaurant. &nbsp;i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and dinner for a company holiday party. &nbsp;mainly had appetizers and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menus to start. &nbsp;the $1 oysters were a hit! &nbsp;served with all oysters essentials (horseradish, tartar sauce, etc.) &nbsp;tater tots were just.. potato tots. &nbsp;the elote was also one of my favorites. &nbsp;popcorn shrimp was interesting.... it really comes with popcorn! there's parking all along the front of the restaurant but you have to enter from 2nd st. cause it's a one way alley. &nbsp;otherwise you have to street park. &nbsp;their valet starts at 5 pm. they have many vegetarian/gluten-free options if you give a crap about that stuff :].i didn't have any cocktails but i saw a lot of interesting drink garnishes (passion fruit, dragon fruit, and other exotic looking fruits.) &nbsp;sangria sucked though - you have been warned. &nbsp;for dinner i had the grilled cornish hen. &nbsp;wasn't too bad - reminded of el pollo loco /: &nbsp;.. wish i chose something else like those big gigantic burgers my co-workers had. &nbsp; not sure if i would come back just for dinner though. &nbsp;i recommend coming here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
went here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> yesterday with my coworker. great $1 oysters and delish barbacoa taco. the cocktails have to be made with soju because of lack of liquor license and they also have sake which was nice accompaniment to my oysters. friendly service, nice atmosphere. i'll be back!
tacos are bit pricy but overall the food and service were good. come by during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for their taco tuesday. shared the cheese pots with some friends. tortillas had a nice toasty corn flavor and the dipping cheeses were nice and saucy and chunky. i forgot the menu descriptions but i remember one having nopales (cactus) in it, the middle a creamy cheese and corn, and the last one had what looked like chopped up poblano peppers. for $13 , cheese pots were yummy and hearty app for sharing.
this review is for the $1 oyster <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;definitely bang for your buck if you're looking for an oyster bar. &nbsp;the oysters were fairly fresh (as compared to oysters i've had straight from the farm and schucking it myself) and delicious. &nbsp;the ones we had that day were big ones (although smaller ones tend to be softer and smoother), these were quite good.drinks were good as well and good prices for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i had the house sangria $5 (sweet, fruity), and hubs had the shot in the box $3 (cold sake), and ipa beer.service was great. &nbsp;it didn't take too long to get the oysters or drinks. &nbsp;from my experience, when there's $1 oyster <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, it tends to take forever just to get your dozen or two of oysters. &nbsp;we were in and out of there in one <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and we ordered 3 and half dozens for 4 people, calamari, and drinks. &nbsp;staff was very nice and friendly.love the ambiance, very chill and the place decor is definitely downtown la. &nbsp;it's got that brick wall for industrial city feel with a bar. &nbsp;place is cool enough for a laid back hangout without it being pretentious or hipster. &nbsp;would definitely go back again.
what a neat converted space in an old brick building. &nbsp;looks like it was a warehouse before it was converted into a restaurant.food was great. &nbsp;my friends and i made it just for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;we got some calamari, oysters, and a burger each. &nbsp;the oysters were tasty and plump. &nbsp;i'm not a fan of sad flat oysters. &nbsp;the calamari good. &nbsp;the burger is where it's at. &nbsp;a good medium rare burger that was juicy and tasted like it was freshly ground (a few nice small chunks of beef in the burger)service was good and mostly quick. &nbsp;definitely an option if you're in the arts district looking for some good food.
what a surprise. &nbsp;we were supposed to go to americano but it was closed. we were amazed with the flavors and presentation of all the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> dishes. the outside urban landscape of the artist district with downtown skyline in the background make for a amazing visual.
usually ordering from here for take out and work lunches on weekdays. service is speedy, food is always great. we are on a mission to try every menu item, as so far everything has been amazing! favorites include: mac &amp; cheese... veggie tacos... and of course <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for a street dog &amp; beers!
i discovered this place this summer:i really like their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - try their tacos and add rice and beans you won't be disappointed - burger is huge in my opinion, shared with my sister and it was very filling w a drink-street corn is yummy worth trying but seems overpriced for size- chilaquiles are worth a try i-bubbly on hh menu worth a try not to sweet and just the right amount of flavor
great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. have only been at that time, so can't speak too much to the menu. buuut, i can praise the helpful and patient staff both behind the bar as well as on the floor (we moved as more ppl arrived). i noshed on a few apps -- and liked them. mostly, i just worked my way through a dozen oysters and was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> as a clam. fresh, tasty, nice accouterment. and i really enjoyed some refreshing summer wine. i think it was a pinot grigio, really don't fully recollect. what i do know is that it was a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> option, and delicious in its own right.i'd love to come back for another hh or settle down for a real meal. relaxed, playful vibe permeates the slightly industrial feel. park in the long lot shared with other connecting establishments, or wing it on the streets. the latter worked for me.great place to meet up with a group, or hang out with just a bud or a date. fun and fresh.
i went there for the first time the other day for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and was sadly disappointed. they have $1 oysters (very small) for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but i don't even think they're worth that price with the terrible service. &nbsp;all the food we ordered was pretty lack luster, overpriced and i hope this review helps shed some light on where some improvements might be made.we ordered the following:sliders (2 for $7) - my boyfriend ordered one of each, he didn't like the barbacoa (dry) and the pulled pork was ok but not worth the price (you can get 3 sliders for $6 at umami burger's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> just down the street and they're of higher quality, better prepared and taste better)insalate rode with salmon - the salmon is a $7 add-on, i thought this was a bit steep for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> salad and it came out slightly burnt and dryla puente backyard burger ($10) - again, not really sure what justifies a $10 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> priced burger where there is nothing exotic or particularly expensive about any of these ingredientsnothing we tried really stood out to either of us as anything more than just &quot;okay.&quot; &nbsp;it was also extremely loud in the venue - so much so that my boyfriend and i had a hard time understanding each other at times while sitting directly across from each other. &nbsp;it also took us over 30 minutes to get our waitress to give us the bill and finish paying. &nbsp;she kept walking past us and ignoring us. &nbsp;we finally had to flag down a kitchen staff member on his way back into the kitchen to get him to get her attention. &nbsp;keep in mind, the restaurant was only a quarter full at this time (about 6 tables seated).it was really disappointing and i expected more for the price considering what's comparable just down the street and even next door (americano has sliders at similar prices, but their sliders are more unique meats like ox-tail and taste better than cerveteca). &nbsp;probably won't be coming here again.
the menu at this place fills a big <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> void; oysters, ceviche, tartare - very tasty, very raw, and therefore very healthy. &nbsp;you've got standard hh items and then you've got these additions that make this place one solid destination for high quality seafood; great addition to the 'hood.helpful and friendly staff is a plus.
stopped by to use a bathroom &nbsp;ended up having an excellent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> meal...super duper fresh oysters and great fried calmary plus great local beer on tap!!! i wish we were hungrier so we could more dishes. .service was great too..would be back soon !!!!
nice place. &nbsp;immediately greeted at the door. all i wanted was some takeout. ordered within 3 minutes of walking in.awesome! &nbsp;then i saw the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu &quot;4-6pm - oysters $1.00&quot;. yes please. &nbsp;i'll have some while i wait for my food!oysters came very quickly. &nbsp;they're shucked right in front of you. &nbsp;they come beautifully served with sides of hot sauce, freshly grated horseradish (yum) and red wine vinegar with shallots. oysters were firm and meaty. &nbsp;i'll be back for this <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> special, for sure.for my dinner i ordered the side beet salad with arugula and goat cheese ($8,) a side of black beans ($4) and a side of plantains ($5)beet salad was perfect. &nbsp;great beet to cheese ratio. &nbsp;balsamic vinaigrette did not overpower.black beans - i didn't think such a small serving of black beans should be $4. &nbsp;i still don't, but the rich flavor of the beans made me forget about the price. plantains were a letdown. &nbsp;they didn't really have a lot of flavor. &nbsp;they either weren't ripe enough or they were not cooked long enough to really let those sugars take hold. &nbsp;i did not devour these like i am known to do.i mean, i still ate them, but it was more of a &quot;meh, i should eat this since i paid for it&quot; instead of a nom nom nom kinda thing. &nbsp;i'll definitely be back here. &nbsp;nice atmosphere, good food, attentive staff and great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials.
i absolutely love this place! everytime we've been here the service is always spot on and it's always <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which is the plus side all the time! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu offers a good amount of options to explore what cerveteca has to offer. the calamari is cooked perfectly, crispy, and goes great with the fried shishito peppers. the barbacoa tacos are the best! super authentic made me think i was visiting my grandparents. i really like that you can order the fresh oysters individually as well since i tend to be the only person who eats oysters when my friends and i come so i usually order about 3 to myself. for my entree i tend to stick to the ribeye steak and get the mac and cheese and root veggies as sides. the mac and cheese is always delicious i love that it has bacon chunks not bits and that it's pairs well with the steak. if you're ever around, stop by. i promise you won't regret it!!
i'm so <span class="highlighted">happy</span> we happened upon this hidden restaurant in the arts district. it was down a street with just a sandwich board pointing to it. they have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> every day and we got several <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food items as well as a jalape&ntilde;o margarita and beer. &nbsp;the margarita was not made with tequila as they probably only have a beer/ wine licence.the food was awesome! the cheese pot was my favorite. three servings of different melted cheese with peppers , corn and other mixins. came with chips and guac. yummmm!!!the burger was really good too. also got the salad and the mexican corn. plenty of food for two. &nbsp;we will definitely be back with friends. only problem with the arts district is there is no parking!! all these great restaurants and shops are popping up &nbsp;but nowhere to park. we have given up quite a few times trying to go to pie hole or the shops around .it's a war to circle forever to find a spot and that's with a long walk. oh well i guess you really have to be committed. cervateca is definitely worth the drive a parking spot hunt though.
hidden in downtown la, this place is such a little gem! we had an awesome time at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with $1 oysters on national margarita day! i tried their classic and spicy margaritas and they were delicious! ask for tahine instead of salt, it's awesome, trust me. their calamari and street dogs are also on point! loaded with peppers that you wouldn't find on the streets of la. loved the lighting and its a great spot to hang out no matter the weather! (it was raining when we were there) it's indoor, but has an outdoor feel because of the open space and redwood furniture. really sweet spot for small plates, cocktails, and good conversation. highly recommended.
i absolutely love this joint! it is exactly what dtla needed! service was friendly and very attentive. the food was out of this world! the bacon in the mac n'cheese!!! omg it is the best! i was there after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but my friends that were there for it said it was delicious and well priced. i would definitely come back and try more of their big dishes. i ate my whole mole enchiladas plate so that is a very very good sign
the second i heard the $1 oysters were on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, i was sold. i had no expectations for this place but i left impressed. i love how down to earth our waitress was. not the typical jaded, worn out, dry la waitresses and waiters you typically come across. the oysters weren't your typical plate of chilled oysters. the limes, lemons, horseradish and red wine vinegarette that comes along with it completes the entire oyster experience.cute little small space at the end of the well known street where you can find wurstkuche and other big arts-district cafes and restaurants. overall, we had a beautiful night and will be returning soon. :)
$1 oysters for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>?? get out of here with that. ;) service is hit or miss. my first time there was horrible. the hosts had a lot of reservations so sat a five top with a baby at a table for four.... we ordered so much food that they had to combine the table next to us to accommodate every thing. oh, did i forget to mention that the restaurant was near empty? it was still three fourths empty by the time we left. ribs are awesome. oysters yum, but side sauces are .. different.spicy marg is great but all their special drinks are made with sake. i don't mind it, but beware if you aren't sake drinkers.omg-- bartender is super hot btw. i would sit at the bar and just order for days to look at him. and he is nice ** drool face **
i wanted to love this spot due to their unbeatable <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>..but there is a lot of room for improvement. they served a glass of wine to my friend and it had a huge crack on it. how scary. the chicano cheese pots had 3 watered down cheeses..the only good dipping sauce was the guacamole. the $1 oysters were delicious however, they tried to take our tray away several times when we weren't finished with the oysters yet. i will most likely come back and give them another chance, perhaps try things on the regular menu like the mac &amp; cheese.
like a lot of other reviewers have been saying, cerveteca is a great space with great potential. however, to me it fell flat in too many areas. it seems like the highlight of this place is the $1 oysters, but that's about it. some friends and i came out for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> last night, and i was excited because i love the food at eat drink americano next door and was hoping to find a similar experience in quality. first of all, what kind of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends at 6? that isn't <span class="highlighted">happy</span> at all. especially with the location being so far removed from where anyone with an office job actually works, getting to enjoy anything before 6 is unrealistic. i work in downtown and all of the <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> within walking distance and near metro stations go at least until 7. that, combined with the way everything is marked up so much after the clock hits 5:59, doesn't really give me any reason to trek out here. the menu includes all of your typical, trendy &quot;gastropub&quot; fare that you can see on any menu at any new restaurant these days; nothing special. many things i like, but the same things on any menu. i agree with another reviewer that a 10% decrease in price would make so much more sense. $13 for a small dish of mac and cheese with bacon ($11 without bacon) isn't very reasonable.my table ordered the calamari (which was lightly fried and served in a small frying basket), which was a little bland; i only had one. we also ordered the chips with guac and salsa, aforementioned mac and cheese, and a salmon taco. the mac and cheese was a baked dish of shells with not enough cheese melted on top, but my favorite part of the meal were the huge, thick, juicy chunks of bacon. as for drinks, the sangria was sweet and refreshing, the shot in a box of cold sake was really cool for the presentation, and the beer variety is pretty good. my friends who made it for the oysters told me that they were of excellent quality. i just hate leaving restaurants feeling like i got ripped off, which i did. service was pretty disappointing as well. these servers were my least favorite kind.... the kind who hover until you order, then disappear once you have your food. our water bottle sat empty most of the meal, and we had to go to the bar to ask for menus for friends who joined later, order drinks, and get our checks. a little more menu focus, reasonable price points, and more engaged service could really make this place something special.
so, i joined my boyfriend and his friends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at this new gastropub that was formerly r23 in the arts district of downtown la. &nbsp;the dimly lit venue has hardwood floors and a brick wall interior &nbsp;with a small intimate feel to it. &nbsp;i was excited that i made it in time to take advantage of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which, on the menu and site indicate ends at 7pm. &nbsp;but learned upon attempting to get our hh priced drinks in, that it actually ends at 6pm they just did not update their menus or site (disappointing and misleading) as we thought we had more time to take advantage of the great prices. &nbsp;needless to say, we were able to get in a few drink orders and take advantage of some of the hh food prices. &nbsp;service: &nbsp;i was greeted with a smile and each server that came to our table was warm and friendly. &nbsp;it took a while to get our server's attention when we were ready to take care of our bill as the restaurant had gotten busy and filled up quickly. &nbsp;food and beverages: &nbsp;there is a raw bar, &nbsp;wide variety of ceviche, tacos, burgers, chicken wings and charcuterie and cheeses offered but i only ordered the patatas bravas and the sangria which i thought were both alright. &nbsp;the others at our table ordered the dollar oysters prior to my arrival and were drinking beers. &nbsp;they stated the oysters were pretty tasty and enjoying the beers accompanying it. &nbsp;a couple of the others ordered the burger which was pretty tasty and my boyfriend said his chicken taco was pretty good. &nbsp;i thought it should be for $5.00parking: &nbsp;there is valet offered but if you take the time to look, adhere to the parking signs, there is street parking available and metered parking during the <span class="highlighted">hours</span> indicated.
we came here on a rainy sunday afternoon for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which starts at 4 and ends at 7. nice place for a sunday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in dtla. i thought the decor and styling of the restaurant was nice, but it was so dark i could barely read the menu! they have tv's in every corner, which is confusing because this isn't really a sports watching destination. we started with the chips, salsa and guacamole. the chips were not warm and i honestly couldn't tell if the salsa was made in house or came from a jar. we tried their version of a margarita, which was disappointing because they are not made with real tequila, they are made with agave wine and were too sweet in my opinion. this was really a let down, especially after becoming used to the amazing (and cheaper) margaritas at yxta down the road. we ordered the wings, calamari and half a dozen oysters from the hh menu. the wings were great, sticky, sweet and a little spicy, especially when paired with the diablo sauce on the side. calamari had a nice light and crispy batter and came with a vibrant yellow sauce that complimented the calamari very nicely. the oysters were some of the best hh oysters i've tried in la, the only problem was they were tiny! overall, if i'm wanting some margs, chips and salsa and mexican food during hh..i'll go somewhere else.
i stumbled upon this place through instagram &amp; they had me at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $1 oysters everyday! it's in the art district in downtown la. it's a cute, trendy, casual, busy little place, w/ a large bar, friendly attentive staff/servers. me &amp; the mister had a dozen oysters, mexican tots (forget exactly what they are called but it's like french fries), and fried calamari. we paired this meal up w/ a apple sangria &amp; spicy margarita which happens to be very good. haven't found a particular meal that's to die for but u can't beat the price- but we will be back to try something different.the pricing, staff passed good vibes, ambience, service, cleanliness, were pretty good - i tipped over 20%
they have a raw bar so you'd expect great &quot;raw&quot; food right? wrong!! i ordered mamas cerviche, which the menu says contains whitefish and shrimp. could have fooled me, i couldnt find any fish or shrimp in this cerviche. if it was in there it was so finely diced that you couldnt taste nor see it. what a total burn. and the service here was totally annoying. the waiter continuously asking if we were done with our plates. its not like the place was crowded and they need the table. off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu i also tried the patatas bravas and the mexican corn on the cob. nothing great about either of these. i've had better elote at many other places. this place certainly has potential but its not worth going out of your way for like i did. $14 for a cerviche that contained very little fish and no shrimp killed it for me.
came for dinner on a sunday so parking was easy peasy. we found a spot on the street and didn't have to pay but. had a little trouble finding the actual restaurant but when you eat in the arts district, always assume the place you're looking for is hidden in an alley somewhere with minimal signage. the place was about half-filled so we had our pick of tables.we split the yellowtail ceviche, agua chile. i loved the yellowtail and the agua chile was good too but not for those with sensitivity to spicy foods. my mouth was on fire after the first bite. i ordered the pescana de la veracruzana (red snapper) as my entree. i was already kind of full from a late lunch but it was delicious. the garlic w/ arroz ajillo was super tasty too. honestly, my leftovers tasted even better the next day than at the restaurant. maybe because all the flavors from the fish, rice and tomatoes had seeped into one another. anyways, i'll definitely try going back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or something. i'd want to try the oysters.
checked out cerveteca on a sat evening. &nbsp;parking was available on the streets but they also have valet if you are less inclined to walk. &nbsp;no reservations but was able to be seated immediately. &nbsp;our server was decent, not overtly friendly but not too cool for school either. &nbsp;detoxing from alcohol so i will have to return later to review their cocktails (which looked amazing). &nbsp;now onto the food!1. appetizers: &nbsp;yellowtail mango ceviche. &nbsp;served with fresh cut jalapenos and housemade chips. &nbsp;delish if you are a fan of the sweet/savory with a little hint of spice flavor palette. 2. main course (me): &nbsp;fish tacos &nbsp;so bomb!! &nbsp;i really liked the housemade corn tortilla, there was a thickness and texture to them unlike anything i've had. &nbsp;but the star of the dish was the cabbage/slaw. &nbsp;there is a wonderful aji flavored dressing in the slaw and it just went wonderfully with the fish.3. &nbsp;main course (husband): &nbsp;chorizo burger. &nbsp;i got to take a bite and it was juicy, spicy and very flavorful. &nbsp;hubby full enjoyed it to the max. &nbsp;also ordered the thick house fries, which is essentially fried potato cubes. &nbsp;fried nice and crispy on the outside and soft potato goodness on the inside. &nbsp;cerveteca..i will return to take advantage of your <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> $1 oysters and try some of your colorful cocktails!
the food here is great. really good. the service however, subpar. i usually go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and have had most things on the menu. being that it's one of the few places in the arts district to eat (before one sante fe opened this past spring) my friends and i would frequent this place. i would recommend the la street dog! really really good. anything really is great and food wise you can't go wrong. but like i said the service, not so great. every time i have been here the service would go down a notch, until it hit rock bottom. the food (although good) would take forever to get to the table and a few times my food would come out a solid 10minutes later than the rest of the tables. the bill has been wrong a few times by charging us for stuff we didn't get as well. all of this usually happened when half the restaurant was filled with people, so it wasn't too busy. i would give it 5stars for the food, 2 for the service.
my friend and i were in search for something new to eat before attending a kings game and even though this wasn't walking distance, it was still close enough and discovered by my friend using yelp. it's a little hard to find, especially if you're trying to find it on foot like i did after taking the gold line to the little tokyo/arts district station.first the food. we started off with the chicano cheese pots. the taste of this appetizer was just as good as the name of the dish. it came with three different types of cheese dips and all three were yummy. it also came with guacamole. the guac was good but i wish there was more. my friend ordered barbacoa, chicken, and veggie tacos and was very pleased with her selection. i ordered the la puente backyard original burger and definitely enjoyed it. it definitely changed my mind as prior to eating this burger, i believed nothing good came out of la puente =d. it's pretty much their version of the standard burger with all the traditional fixins with the patty cooked to your liking. the two things that really impressed me most about cerveteca, was the fact that they had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on sunday, which made our meal way more affordable than we had originally anticipated. just make sure you order before 7. the other was the decor. they did an awesome job converting this space into a trendy spot that fits into the gentrified area.
hit or miss with an expansive menu - there is something for everyone. service was stellar considering we had a large birthday party of more than 20 people.delicious mac n cheese featuring pasta shells and thick bacon. the pulled pork sandwich and the enchiladas were a hit with our large party, but i didn't try any so i am only rating what i tasted. yellowtail ceviche and uni calamari pasta did not live up to the hype - left me hungry and unsatisfied. the ceviche was bland and lacked citrus/acid and the accompanying tortilla chips were nothing special. the uni calamari &quot;pasta&quot; tasted plainly of ponzu, and tasted more like poke. would have made a better appetizer than a main entree.ribeye was decent, large portion but could have used more seasoning. would like to come back for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, the raw bar, the tacos, the chorizo burger. dragon punch makes for a pretty cocktail served with frozen dragon fruit ice.
we came here on a whim friday night for dinner. place is really cute, situated in a very &quot;happening&quot; part of arts district / little tokyo.services: our server was lovely - attentive, polite, nice. food: we got few appetizers, tacos and an entree:* oysters -tasty, a little pricey but good. * yellowtail ceviche - ok,i love ceviche. this one was just ok. first of it was more of a crudo as fish was sliced. second - the amount of jalapeno in comparison to the fish was overwhelming. mango was a nice touch - but overall not worth getting* baja fish tacos - great tortilla, nicely cooked fish* baby back ribs - mac &amp; cheese with pork belly was amazing! it was really tasty. garlic green bean were also very very good. ribs itself had a good flavor, but looked more like regular ribs and were not cooked enough. for me ribs should be falling off the bone and these were not. * drinks - great selection of beer, wine, sake. all in all - decent place and will def be back to try their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
when waze said to take a left at alley, i thought is the restaurant on a street called alley or is it on an alley? &nbsp;yep, located on an alley squeezed between buildings with artsy graffiti. &nbsp;parking spots had cones, but when you pulled up to a &quot;valet&quot;, it was $5. &nbsp;he proceeded to back up the car, to one of the cones, move the cone, park the car and handed us the keys. &nbsp;i had made reservations online and purchased a deal thru giltcity (deal was 2 margaritas, shared appetizer, 2 entrees &amp; shared dessert for $65).we walked in and they immediately took us to our table. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was wrapping up. &nbsp;has a warehouse feel to it and its loud, but casual &amp; open. &nbsp;our table had one of us in a booth, while the other seat was on a wooden stool. &nbsp;(i had the booth, so no idea on the comfort of stool.)they have only beer &amp; wine here, but i decided try their spicy &quot;margarita&quot;. &nbsp;made with agave wine, this was the best tasting &quot;margarita&quot; without tequila i've had. &nbsp;it was spicy, but not too much. &nbsp;for our appetizer, we tried the calamari &amp; shishito peppers. &nbsp;breading on calamari was bland &amp; husband didn't like. &nbsp;i thought it was average, but the peppers were prepared just right, but we only got about 3 peppers. &nbsp;i did like the leche de tigre dip.for my entree, i got the chorizo burger. &nbsp;this was very good. &nbsp;chorizo(pork &amp; beef) patty, oaxacan cheese, aioli, &amp; a fried egg on a brioche. &nbsp;yum. &nbsp;its served with potatoes or a green salad. &nbsp;i got a green salad with the house vinaigrette, but they switched my salad with my husband's salad, so i didn't eat it. &nbsp;husband got the pulled pork sandwich and thought it was very good.for dessert, we got the tres leches cake. &nbsp; &nbsp;i've had much better. &nbsp;so instead of wasting my calories on tres leches, i ordered a couple more of those spicy margaritas. &nbsp;overall, my burger was delicious hence the 4 stars, but i would say this is more of an afterwork hangout with friends/colleagues versus a date night spot.
went there for the first time last friday during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;i do not drink alcohol so i decided to try their pineapple water; it was delicious! &nbsp;had a salad with grilled salmon. &nbsp;salmon was fresh, made with a crusty outside which made it very tasteful. &nbsp;my friend tried their mac and cheese which was topped with crispy bacon. &nbsp;word of the wise: &nbsp;if you are watching your weight, don't try it, you won't be able to stop eating it until it's all gone! &nbsp;we also had their bbq wings. &nbsp;i was impressed when i did not taste the vinegar in the sauce as i always do (in other places). &nbsp;they were very tasty, and will definitely have them again. &nbsp;parking was a little hard to find because we got there before 5:00 p.m., and their valet service does not start until then. &nbsp;it did not take us that long to find a spot on the street though, and we had to walk one block only so i am not complaining about that. &nbsp;the ambiance was friendly, all the waiters and waitresses were efficiently helping each other out so our glasses were never empty, and they checked on us often. &nbsp;will definitely go back in the near future!
i came back to try this place again and i definitely had a whole other experience. everyone was really friendly and courteous which was great. i was a little nervous at first because of my experience last time and you know, going to a place after writing a negative yelp review feels a little strange, but it was definitely worth it. i took the owners recommendation and tried the platos grandes- ribs. it was amazing, the meat slid right off of the bone and the mac and cheese it came with was to die for. we also got the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cheese pots which were also very very very delicious. i also can't forget about the arnold palmer i ordered. it had a hint of mint. it reminded me of the mint julep from disneyland (which i love) it is so refreshing. i don't know what else to tell you except yvonne and her family (all these dishes are family recipes) must be wizards or something because all of the food here is magical. (hahah)any cons from this trip? nope, it was a great experience and i was very pleased at how apologetic everyone was about our previous experience and i agreed that it may have just been a weird chain of events.i am excited to come back here with more co workers since i can tell that they would be able to seat our crazy bunch.
all across the board whatever you order is going to be delish! my favorite picks would have to be the hangover soup and of course the bacon mac &amp; cheese! you can never go wrong with their michiladas either!! mac and peter( bar backs) make the best michi's. ideal location for any time of day if your coming for breakfast or brunch order a beer battered waffle it's served with a side if honey glazes bacon that makes you wanting more. there is a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so be sure to check this place out if your in the art district downtown. &nbsp;i cant wait to see what the owner has in store for his next launching. here at the downtown location they have a seafood bar which is very different from their venice beach location. the location in los angeles, is more of a lounge for after work locals and someone who wants a great meal in a nice modern industrial location overlooking the dtla skyline, perfect to start here and bounce around the town. highly recommend this place!!
originally i was planning to go to little tokyo to do another dine50 mission, &nbsp;but i ended up following a small group into this place. i absolutely love it!i was situated at the bar and sat next to the owners' father and mom. they're down to earth people. the mom (wears a &quot;chef mom&quot; hat) would make sure if i was okay and explain about what went into to the sauce that came with the calamari. the dad would talk about how his son, oscar, owns three restaurants...clutch, cerveteca on rose avenue, and also has one food truck. before i left, he told me that he's usually at the rose avenue location and that it would be nice for me to eat and drink with him during brunch times. he's awesome! i'll probably take up his offer one day. &nbsp;ambiance/decor: a bit dark and loud, but it is expected for a restaurant/bar. furnishings are on the modern side.service: loved the service! staffers were very nice and patient. explained every food item that i was inquiring about and the food came out at a decent rate.food: i made it torwards the tail end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! i'm glad i made it! 1) oysters: can't say no to $1 oysters. plus, the server told me they were big and fatty that day. so i told him half a dozen please! very fresh and good think i didn't taste any sand! the oysters came with a red wine vinaigrete and tapatio sauce, lime, and horse radish shavings, i liked their red wine vinaigrette sauce, but didn't care much for the horse radish shavings :)tip: put lime and tapatio (hot sauce) or the red vinaigrete sauce on those suckers! you know the drill! :)2) fried calamari with shishito peppers... $7: pricing on this is a bit on the pricy side, but i have to give them brownie points for presentation. the calamari came out in a small mini fryer and some of them overflowed to the plate. the shishito peppers and the sauce that came with this app. gave the calamari a spicy kick.. basically, its a concoction of amarillo chili and garlic.would definitely come back to try other things on their menu!
wow. what an incredible meal we just had tonight. there aren't too many restaurants i have been this impressed with in a while. from their fresh seafood to amazing grilled meats, everything was prepared to perfection! &nbsp;since they offer a fully stocked raw-bar with a wide variety of ceviche we decided on sampling their peruvian ceviche (basically salmon crudo topped with a sweet/savory salsa) served with a side of popcorn. it was nice and refreshing, though a tad bit sweet. i personally prefer my raw seafoods a little on the simpler side, just dressed with lemon/lime and a pinch of salt, nothing more. also ordered a half dozen oysters served with fresh grated horseradish, mignonette sauce and tapatio. wish they offered spicy cocktail sauce and tabasco for those oysters instead of tapatio. during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (daily from 3-7pm) oysters go for $1 a pop! such a steal!! we followed our raw seafood appetizers with fried fish this time opting to try the baja beer battered cod fish tacos w/aji, crema, slaw &amp; salsa. one of the best fish tacos i've had. perfect crisp battered cod. for entree i opted for their grilled lamb special of the night served w/garlic rice and a choice of side. went with the brussels sprouts w/bacon. to die for! haden't had lamb taste so delicate like this before, grilled to absolute perfection, melt in your mouth tender. those brussels sprouts w/bacon were also quite amazing. they were topped with some sort of insanely delicious sauce i wanted to drink up with a straw.fire grilled churrasco ribeye steak w/chimichurri was served w/garlic rice and choice of side. another incredible perfectly grilled protein of the night. honestly, i highly recommend ordering their meats vs. ceviche. it's that mind blowing good. don't get me wrong, the ceviche is also quite tasty, but their meats were far more superior. let's not forget to mention the best mac n' cheese of all time! made with organic cinghiale pasta, bechamel, cali-cow cheddar cheese, goat cheese, panko bread crumbs, bacon. i was lost for words. ended our meal with dessert, the cerveteca sundae - fried ice cream with fried plantains. felt somewhat like a churro ice cream sandwich. pretty tasty way to seal the deal.there wasn't much we could nit pick to complain about. highly recommend stopping by for an unforgettable meal, and highly recommend ordering their grilled meats as they were executed to perfection! location wise they are in the heart of the art's district, a bit hard to find. spot 'eat drink americano' and you'll find them in the same complex a few doors down. they've occupied the former r23 sushi joint.
cerveteca should settle in nicely into the neighborhood once it gets its sea legs.located next door to another neighborhood favorite of mine, eat drink americano, cerveteca shows promise. &nbsp;the interior is simply laid out and has a mix of raised seating areas and standard tables. &nbsp;the red brick walls lend an industrial feel to the space. &nbsp;the music is at volume where you can hear the other party talk to you, but you will have to speak in elevated voices throughout the evening. &nbsp;in other words, a great place to hang out with friends, but maybe not the best for an intimate date.the menu has a good mix of mexican inspired entrees and appetizers with a ceviche raw bar for good measure. &nbsp;we ordered the yellowtail ceviche, which was just ok. &nbsp;there was too much ponzu or soy sauce seasoning and the yellowtail wasn't in small chunks, but rather large strips. &nbsp;i ordered the grilled salmon tacos, which come two to an order. &nbsp;overall, a solid dish with lots of shredded cabbage and toppings. &nbsp;these are a good size and will fill you up just enough without feeling too full. &nbsp;the organic chicken enchilada with tomatillo sauce was a bit of a disappointment. &nbsp;first off, the dish was very lukewarm in temperature when it first arrived. &nbsp;second, it's just two enchiladas with white rice on the side. &nbsp;it seemed like a bit of a letdown. &nbsp;when a manager came by to ask how we were doing and we noted the enchilada dish he was apologetic and kindly comped the dish even though we were fine with paying for it.cerveteca has a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-7pm and seems like a perfect place to come for drinks and appetizers or a light dinner. &nbsp;there are enough tv screens to watch sporting events, but are not too intrusive to make it feel like a sports bar by any means. &nbsp;the manager/staff obviously seem to care about the food and overall dining experience so my kudos to them. &nbsp;cerveteca is still experiencing growing pains, but with a little more time could be a great spot.
3 1/2 starscame here for dinner with a friend. it's a big hard to find at first, but it's right next to eat drink americano. there is some street parking, but luckily we took an uber. the inside itself is real nice, i would say industriel chic. a bit cozy, dim and romantic. they have a pretty good selection to choose from the menu. from raw bar, burgers, tacos and main dishes. i would say a bit mexican food mixed with peruvian._red sangria ($10) this was good. nicely sweet, and not too strong or bitter it was the perfect sangria to start the night. i would get this again! _baja fish tacos ($5) (1 each)beer battered cod, aji, creme, slaw, salsa. this was pretty good. the fish was nicely battered, lots of slaw and good amount of creme and salsa. it was good but i think it's pretty pricey for 1. i've had many fish tacos that were just as good, even better for half the price! _tacos de barbacoa ($5) (1 each) braised shredded beef, guajillo, cilantro, red onions, mama's salasa. this was just okay. the beef was juicy and a tad spicy. we did eat the tortilla, because we did not want to get too full before our entrees, but to me this was just soso. and for $5 it was not worth it. the tortilla is warm and soft._herb basted game hen ($21) achiote, thyme, rosemary with arroz ajillo, choice of side, bread or tortillas. nice presentation, pretty big entree for one person. i'd say 2 can share this as well. the hen was cooked perfectly. nicely grilled and juicy. the marinade was a bit citrus like and a tad sweet. the rice was so fluffy and tasty! the bread that came with it was nicely grilled and crisp but the taste was a bit like burnt gas. the red salsa on the side was great! not too spicy but the right amount of taste to go with the hen and even drizzle on the rice. for my side, i got the maple brussel sprouts w/smoked bacon. this was so good. if you don't like your veggies, then try this because you just may change your mind. the brussels were cooked perfecly, the maple sauce was sweet and thick and with the thick bacon bits, you get sweet and salty. _churrasco ribeye steak ($28) fire grilled, chimichurri, served with arroz ajillo, choice of side, bread or tortillas. so initially my friend ordered their special of the day, which was the lamb chop but they were all out so we got ribeye instead. this too came out huge. the ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare, however the taste was off. i don't know if it's the marinade but my friend was not liking it. he said it tasted like gas. i took a bite and knew what he meant. we asked our waitress if it was made over a gas and not grill but she said no. what ever the case it had a bad aftertaste and he is one to never bring back the food but it was to the point where he just was not enjoying it. our waitress was nice to take it back and exchange for another dish. we got there other special of the day, which was the branzino._branzino special of the day. i'm used to having branzino already served fillet style, without any of the bones, but this came as the whole fish, which was nince but a huge hassle to eat as there were bones everywhere. the taste was good, branzino tends to be a bit bland but so good to pair with sides that have lots of flavor. overall i don't think i would come here again, ,unless a friend wanted to come or it's a birthday. the tacos were overpriced, and the entrees tasted a bit like burnt gas for some reason. maybe it was just us but i think i expected too much from the reviews. i would maybe come check out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu since i did enjoy the red sangria. service was good.
cerveteca is a super hip and absolutely delicious latin joint in dtla's arts district. &nbsp;great food, stellar service, nice ambience...this is a must try!=food= &nbsp; &nbsp;1) chinese chicken kale salad - don't ask why i had this at a latin restaurant, but i'm actually glad i did! &nbsp;kale, cabbage, carrots, green onion, mandarin oranges, toasted sesame, onions, cilantro and chicken. &nbsp;yum! &nbsp;the chicken could've been a little more tender, but it was good regardless, and i'd get this dish again! &nbsp; &nbsp;2) tacos de barbacoa - it comes with 2 tacos of braised shredded beef on house made corn masa tortillas, guajillo, cilantro, red onion, and salsa. &nbsp;i didn't get to try the entire thing, but i was able to get a taste of the braised shredded beef. &nbsp;it was so delicious, juicy and tender. &nbsp;i was actually kind of bummed i didn't order my own. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) half a dozen oysters - delicious and fresh! &nbsp;they have cholula, horse radish, lime, and red wine vinaigrette. &nbsp;the oysters that they had were from mexico and a bit more firm than others, but still......so good. &nbsp;i can eat oysters for days. &nbsp;it's such a shame that i didn't get this for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...only $1/oyster! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4) cerveteca sundae - yum! &nbsp;fried ice-cream and plantains. &nbsp;there's also strawberries on the side! &nbsp;i love that the ice-cream and the plantains balanced out each other in terms of sweetness (you wouldn't think so, right?)! &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;5) organic chicken enchiladas with mole - very good! &nbsp;i really like mole and haven't had mole in so long that the semi-chocolaty sauce was perfect to me. &nbsp;just the right amount of savory with the hint of that chocolate. &nbsp;it's definitely not for all, but it was definitely for me!=service=i've been here twice and the service was spot on each time. &nbsp;everyone here is very friendly and helpful. &nbsp;i've had waiters sit down next to you to have small conversations with you as well. &nbsp;food came out in good timing, and we were always being checked on to make see if things were to our liking. &nbsp;we even stayed past their closing once, they were still so kind to us! =location/parking &amp; ambience=the only thing about this place that i'm not used to is the lighting. &nbsp;it's very dim, so in the evening, it's quite dark inside. &nbsp;perfect little place to catch up with a few friends and grab food and drinks, or even for a nice date! &nbsp;it's located in a little alley next to eat drink americano, and so close to wurstkuche. &nbsp;there's parking all along the streets and about 2 or 3 spots right in front of the restaurant in the alley. &nbsp;if you come during prime eating <span class="highlighted">hours</span>, you'll find it harder to locate a spot, but it's definitely not impossible...and everything's within parking distance.=final verdict=they have great service and delicious food! &nbsp;i love this place and will be a repeat customer again and again!
i went to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> today for the first time and was very disappointed with the service. &nbsp;it began with our arrival around 5:30 we were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. &nbsp;we received our drinks in about 10 minutes and placed our orders of 10 oysters, a taco, and wings around 5:40. &nbsp;other parties began to arrive and placed orders for drinks and food. &nbsp;one particular &nbsp;party sitting across from our table received drinks and food within 15 minutes. i also noticed the same table was conversing &nbsp;with other wait staff and giving each other a high five before there food quickly came out. 5:40 turned to 6:15 then 6:25 finally i asked our waiter if she could check our order. &nbsp;the manager then came to our table and apologized for the service and said an incident occurred in the kitchen and we'd be getting our food soon. &nbsp;we received &nbsp;a 3rd of our order at 6:35 then another item came at 6:40. we finally received what i'd consider the easiest item to prepare, the oysters, around 6:50 and water was also finally brought. &nbsp;the food was decent but the owners should strongly consider examining the efficiency of it's staff. &nbsp;i also noticed the manager texting on her phone during our service. i hope this review helps the owners and other customers because the place has potential but with bad service like this can ruin an establishment.
loved this place! i'll summarize first and then i'll go into the details. food: super tasty and down-right delicious. no fancy concoctions of various animal parts mixed with french techniques and this and that. straight up food made like grandma made it if grandma had a cool, hipster-type sous chef! ambiance and service: cozy, super chill, but without taking itself too seriously; only dedicated to making your experience absolutely delightful, which they did!went with the family after watching a show at the wd concert hall. after a search on yelp (of course!) i realized that most places didn't open for dinner until after 6, when all the cool, non-family types apparently go out to eat. since i clearly don't fall into that camp, i chose cerveteca because it was open earlier than that. as we walked in, they immediately noticed my little ones and pointed out that they had reserved a table with bar stools for us, but we could choose to sit on the lower tables if that would be more comfortable for the kids. we moved to a table with short chairs right in front of a large open window with the most incredible view of what's happening in dtla right now: in the forefront a fence with barbed wire and walls filled with murals and graffiti, in the background the la skyscrapers. our server was super friendly! it's always tricky when trying new, off-the-beaten path places with kids because you're not sure how &quot;kid friendly&quot; the place or the service will be. and by kid friendly i don't mean that i expect the menu to have chicken fingers (yuck!), but that the service will be welcoming and most of all, accommodating. welcoming and accommodating these folks were! my son asked for chocolate milk and our server paused and told him he didn't think they had any, but that he would go back and see if they could create something. my son was <span class="highlighted">happy</span> and satisfied and although they couldn't whip up the chocolate milk, he did bring him mint lemonade and when my son's face shriveled upon tasting it (it was a bit sour and tart for a 6 year old), our server took it back and added some simple syrup to make it sweeter. how awesome is that?!!ok what we ordered: pulled pork with papas bravas tator tots for my 11 year old who couldn't stop licking her fingers and stuffing her face. the pork was juicy, marinated in spices, and then the sauce kicked it all up to another level! the tator tots were like little pillows of heaven (yes i tasted everyone's food!). my 6 year old had the mac n cheese which were oven baked sea shells that tasted like the mexican version of &quot;sopita&quot;: pasta lightly pan fried with onions, garlic and tomato sauce and then cooked in chicken broth. it had manchego (i think. it was a tasty melting cheese) and goat cheese melted over it with a light crunch. amazing! the husband had the chorizo burger: it had chorizo. enough said. i had the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce with a side of plantains. the mole..........it's so hard to make good mole, to make it &quot;just right.&quot; the only other place outside my mother's kitchen that makes excellent mole is &quot;la casita mexicana&quot; in bell and now cerveteca. it was the perfect blend of sweet, smoky, cocoa-ey and with a kick. the chicken was juicy, tender, tasty. i used the plantains to &quot;lick&quot; off any trace of mole left on the plate - it was that good!no dessert, although we really wanted to! we just couldn't possibly stuff any more food into our faces. because we got there at 5, our drinks were priced at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices which was awe-some! can't wait to come back!!
the-must-los-angeles-2
best sangria! everything on their menu is delicious. i love the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> wings. wine wednesday every wednesday for sure! friendly staff.
i was pleasantly surprised by this place. &nbsp;came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during the week. &nbsp;had great, great service! &nbsp;the staff is casual, but very attentive and on top of it. &nbsp;the food was much better than i anticipated and we were able to try almost everything from their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu, and it was all delicious. &nbsp;their sangira was great as well, and a nice choice of wines for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.good atmosphere with outdoor seating. &nbsp;this is definitely a place to be for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;their prices are very good as well. &nbsp;i would give this place a 5, but would like to try their full menu first.
cute place to hang. love their <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. good food. great services. and very organize and clean restaurant.
the must has an incredible <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with a wonderful selection of wine. &nbsp;the service is attentive and extremely friendly!
good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with tasty sliders and beer specials, friendly people, great indoor-outdoor set-up. looking forward to coming back.
first time here. &nbsp;good selection on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;would definitely come back!
pros: &nbsp;great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink prices and decent location. cons: &nbsp;slow service and mediocre food. they're overpriced, and the last time i visited, i ordered the green bucatini. my pasta was over cooked and the sauce tasted like pur&eacute;ed kale. i recommend going there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> rather than for dinner.
great service in a quiet location. we came for friday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (ends at 7) and were seated in outdoor patio immediately.white sangria was refreshing and fries were average.
review for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only:<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-7pm (mon-fri)snack menu is limited like all <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. drink menu had quite a selection from sangria $6 to wine to beer to spirits.the white sangria has a sparkling peach taste and the black sangria had a hint of blackberry. place is not crowded. things worth ordering: -drinks -smashed latkes (smashed tator tots) comes out super hot!-duck liver mousse with 4 tiny crostini and pickles (liver mousse was pretty tasty, just not enough crostini for the amount of liver mousse they give you) if you like pate, it's worth a try for $5.-friescons: parking street parking is worth it if you find one that has a meter until 6pm if you are going here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! otherwise, you'll see some meters that say parking from 4pm-8pm, each <span class="highlighted">hour</span> cost $4. that's more than what you'd pay for parking in the flat rate parking lot of $8.00. street parking is a hit or miss! if you're lucky you'll find one that's free.borderline to the sketchy part of dtla
great food + drinks every time. always playing good music and <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is everyday, wow! cheers!!
cholo fried rice, do it up!update: i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the well whiskey they serve for $6 a glass is amazing! a whiskey on the rocks (actually, the one big square rock) for that price is a steal.
mac n cheese with goldfish crumble are to die for! super yummy! great service! love their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! can't wait to go back
love this place! love the wine! love <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! love chris and chrisi!! love the atmosphere! it has become our weekly spot for girls night for all these reasons. chris is just an absolute sweetheart, very attentive and always has a smile on his face. if either of them ever go anywhere, we will follow!! while the food is tasty.. there aren't many options for small snacky share plates. love the latkes!! but other than those, most entree items are priced rather high and too complicated for having sips at the bar with friends... and the latkes are only on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
the must is a must go to! visited on a saturday afternoon while venturing through downtown la. we had about 6 people in our group and were seated immediately. we made it for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> just in the nick of time! the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu had a decent amount of beer selections to chose from. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu also offered mac &amp; cheese (with goldfish crumble) which was to die for! the mac &amp; cheese was delicious!! the goldfish crumble adds a complementing crunch to the cheesy mac. the must has a relaxed vibe to it which makes it a fun spot to grab a drink and/or bite to eat with friends. the indoor/outdoor design to the restaurant allows you to enjoy the outdoors while sitting inside or vice versa. the decor is creative and retro. overall, great spot in dtla!
dropped in to try <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - sliders, wings, salad, and one of the gourmet burgers (entr&eacute;e). &nbsp;the food was pretty good, although i did not truly fall in love with any. &nbsp;what i did like was the atmosphere, vibe, and service. &nbsp;it looks fancy, but everyone is pretty laid back. &nbsp;good lay out, good deals for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and good assortment of beers, cocktails, and wines. &nbsp;when i heard the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> starts at 3 p.m., i was thinking this just might be a new spot to hit up after work. &nbsp;definitely the type of place to hang out with friends. &nbsp;the servers were all cool. my type of place to chill and it is walking distance to some cool lounges and bars.fyi, got there at 7 p.m. and it was pretty empty. after an <span class="highlighted">hour</span>, the place was packed. &nbsp;tables were reserved. &nbsp;i suggest making reservations if you are coming for dinner or with a big group. &nbsp;gets a little warm in the summer. &nbsp;had to step out a few times.
stopped by this place last weekend with my girlfriends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and we were so glad we did! their white sangria is so yummy and delicious, this is a must try! since we were there during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, we took advantage of their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu and ordered 4 appetizers and they were all just bleh. &nbsp;oh yea, the waitress that served us was super sweet and nice, even though she looked super busy running all over the place.i would definitely come back to this place for drinks!
nice <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;chill vibe! &nbsp;interesting wine list with something for everyone and cocktails if you are not wine inclined. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> nosh is tasty and the big menu looks like there are some fun choices! &nbsp;the staff is always smiling and seem to really enjoy their jobs. &nbsp;it's quiet enough to have a conversation if you go early and i can't wait till it warms up to check out the patio. &nbsp;i will be back!
great place to hang out with friends, a casual laid-back, dark and cosy atmosphere. perfect place to head over for drinks after a long day at work. this is my second time here, came on saturday night and dining area is not crowded. we booked the tables at the bar area and it was way too stuffy in there that many of us were sweating and decided to walk out to the patio for some air. overall, i like the place, wine, and food. will be back to try the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> daily from 4-7pm.
atmosphere amazing!! the staff, friendly and the food is so so so good. drinks, super delicious!! great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. this is a &quot;must&quot; see place!! dt's hidden gem!!
i had a wonderful time going to the must for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a weekday afternoon. this place has a very hipster vibe, exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant located in dtla. i loved the warm atmosphere inside and the seated setup, plus the option to sit outdoors on the patio as well. the place wasn't too crowded and there were even some people with their computers out doing work. might make for a good study spot in the middle of the day! we ordered everything off the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu except for the cholo fried rice, which was delicious! but probably over priced. expected a larger portion for the $16 we paid to split it. loved the latkes--so salty and crispy! and the sangria was berry-good! haha. would check it out again!
was looking for a new place to go downtown with a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that lasted until 7 pm. &nbsp;this is definite a great place.. loved the d&eacute;cor and the staff was friendly.only problem.. it's on the edge of skid row. &nbsp;i felt a little edgy walking 50 feet from my car to the place in broad daylight. &nbsp;it was much better when i walked back with my companion.they have a cute little <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.. i enjoyed their house red. &nbsp;i also thought the bartender (kristy) was awesome and helpful. &nbsp;also tried their potato fried pancake things.. it was so good that my companion ordered a second order. &nbsp;i only had maybe three of them out of the 35+ my companion ate. &nbsp;i also had their chicken slider.. pretty good.. would have liked to get something a little healthier and grilled but it was fried to perfection. &nbsp;oh.. and i am not a fan of the mayo... but i guess it's with the entire unhealthy theme.will have to try the food here since it looks pretty delish based on these reviews...
i would say this is a must for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.. if you work in the area, it's a really cool spot to check out after work. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices are something i can't argue with here!$4 beers, $5 sangria, and discounts on the appetizers!!came here for a birthday dinner and we ordered different dishes to try family style. &nbsp;the portions were kinda small and hard to split among 5 people so i wouldn't recommend it if your're hungry...my favorites here were the appetizers: jalapeno hush puppies and their mac n cheese is bombbbbb (this is truly a must to try). from the entree i liked the &quot;yo mama's chicken&quot;. &nbsp;the glaze/sauce on it is amazinggg but its $20 for the plate..food and drinks took a little while to come out. waitress confessed that she made mistakes which prolonged our wait for food, however, she was pleasantly nice and friendly about it. &nbsp;parking is available in a nearby lot (around $8) which is a lot in my opinion. i luckily found street parking a few blocks away so that's another option for parking. nice environment inside. love their patio lighting and indoor set-up. they play 80s movies on a projector on a wall and have magazines against the walls and armrests on their couches!i would come back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only is my point. &nbsp;a bar called &quot;lash&quot; is next door where you can get in for free too so i'd recommend checking out that spot afterwards if you want to keep partying! &nbsp;i'm always on the look out for great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spots so if you know of any with great food and prices, let me know!! :)
came to this nifty little bar for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> yesterday night and i was not disappointed. the ambience of the bar was very relaxed but had a nice dash of class to it. the layout is also really cool and cozy. i walked in and sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and attentive i really enjoyed his company as i was waiting for my group. next the food and drinks were all delicious and i cannot wait to come back for the wine tasting we discussed with the waiter who was very friendly and lots of fun!
great place to try on a saturday afternoon. &nbsp;they have a great saturday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with great prices on drinks. &nbsp;the food was not impressive but the decor is so stinking cute and charming and with drinks flowing, you kinda are just ok with the food being just ok. &nbsp;:) service was great. &nbsp;next time, i'd love to sit on the patio or bar area. &nbsp;will definitely come back maybe for lite nibbles. &nbsp;oh and fun and cheeky wallpaper in the women's restroom. &nbsp;;)
i really liked the hostess and the wait staff. it was kind of busy but the food seemed to be flowing out from the kitchen. we ordered the following, in this order:cholo fried ricekale and shrimp salad5 cheese plate.hers where the problem began, the cheese plate comes out first. but after an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> the other two dishes come out. they where very apologetic and even discounted my bill, but i was full after waiting an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> and the results of the food, where really just average. again mistakes happen so i'll try them again for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere nice. they have a great patio and friendly employees.
what a delicious, fun and comfortable addition to downtown la. the environment is fantastic, easy going, and modern, as is the decor! the wait staff was incredibly personable, helpful and funny. we went on a sunday night during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, which was a really amazing deal. we ordered one of everything on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu because it was such a good deal. we had the tater tots (which were more like latkes, in a good way), macaroni and cheese (with goldfish!), hush puppies and schnitzel sliders. everything was well-prepared and delicious. the dipping sauces were top notch! for dessert we had the fluffer nutter and monkey bread. don't get me started on the fluffer nutter! argghhh so good. also, sunday night is game night. they bring out a million board games for everyone. how cool is that? i love this place.
interesting place, appreciated the decor and ambiance. i arrived at 3 pm so lunch was over, but dinner was not available yet. bummer. only the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu was available. accordingly, i tried all of the snack items. they were all pretty yummy. ordered the black sangria as well, which was delicious. i would like to go back to try their lunch/dinner menu, it all sounds really good! parked in the $8 lot right next door to it, probably could've found street parking.
great weekend brunch spot -- i loved sitting out on their patio. their brunch menu is also really interesting -- the huevos &quot;in your face&quot; was a little underwhelming, but the biscuit benedict was great. their &quot;answer to boring mimosa&quot; is &quot;bottomless sorbet sparklers&quot; -- basically a scoop of colorful fruit sorbet on top of sparking wine. they also sell a bottle of bubbly for $16 if you want to order a side of o.j. and make your own mimosas instead.we found a meter right out side the restaurant, so parking was easy.i'd like to try out their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> next!
decided to try this spot out over the weekend after receiving an email from yelp mentioning some of the best places for macaroni. went during their brunch/<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> transition. although we waited about 10-15 minutes to be seated while our table was being cleaned and had four different servers ask us if we had been helped (communication is key - everyone should be on the page regarding their customers), the rest of my experience was pleasant and the food definitely made up for any lack of service in the beginning. as suggested, i had to try their macaroni. orecchiette pasta, a mix of stringy, white cheeses and topped with goldfish crackers. i love the whimsical addition of the goldfish but the flavor is totally dependent on the cheese mix. perfection - seriously one of the best! i was so impressed with their mac, so i tried additional bar snacks like their smashed tater tots and jalape&ntilde;o hush puppies. the taters were deliciously salty bits of crunchy potato pancakes and served with garlic aioli and ketchup. the jalape&ntilde;o hush puppies looked like donut holes, but were dense corn fritters with jalape&ntilde;o bits that paired with the honey butter dip. these <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> bites went well with their white sangria. a refreshing white wine beverage with a hint of peach liqueur. i definitely recommend trying their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and bites and all for a total reasonable price.
cool little spot in an area that's on its way to being super cool. &nbsp;the space was a bit small and the decor was good but nothing that really stood out but the staff was nice, they gave the right amount of attention (not too much or too little), and they have a good <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;would definitely go back if i'm in the area and am looking for a chill place.
ambiance is probly the number one reason for the 5 stars. i'm a sucker forgreat atmosphere. it's on a side road of dtla great wall graffiti to look at across the street. the cholo fried rice was fantastic, mac and cheese is off the chain and the chicken was really good with lemon garlic spinach. go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and save a few bucks on drinks, their &quot;well drinks&quot; are top shelf.
this place is phenomenal! the wine selection is so unique, the food is fresh from farmers markets, and the specialty cocktails are executed with exquisite balance and perfection. the first time i visited here it felt so comfortable, welcoming, and exciting at the same time. i ordered the cholo fried rice and ever since then it's been hard to venture to try something new, but each time i do, i never regret it!!!always ask for the daily specials because they are always fresh and local. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 3-7, combined with the elegant patio is exactly what i crave after a long day at work. to top it off the servers and bartenders are friendly and knowledgable!
i love the must!drinks: generous sized cocktails for decent prices. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> massive glasses of sangria are a steal at $5 a glass. food: i've been here three times in the last month and the food has been consistently excellent. as many have said, the cholo fried rice is a stand out, as are the smashed tots. the portions are generally big and good for sharing.ambience: the outdoor patio makes for perfect people watching on the weekends, otherwise slide into a booth inside and bask in the industrial chic aesthetic. also check out the zoltar dealing fortunes downstairs on the way to the restrooms. service: i have never had anything but very friendly service. the waitresses have always given great advice on food and drinks. being honest, sometimes they're super speedy bringing out dishes but other times they're a little slow - so be mindful of this.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is 3-7 daily, grab some cheap sangria, schnitzel sliders and thank me later!
i come here often for brunch. the food is great; the corned beef hash, cholo fried rice, and mustwich are a few of my favorites. they have a great bottomless mimosa deal and tasty biscuits. however, the service has been terrible every time i've been here. once our server walked out on his shift during my meal. today i was sitting down for 30 minutes and asked 3 bus boys for my server before someone arrived. reading other reviews it seems that service is great during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so i will have to try then.
disclaimer****i was a huge fan of the old must on spring street. we use to come for &quot;pre&quot; <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and hang out. loved the food, the vibe and the wine.i have to say this must may be better... the old must was great but their selection of food was limited and i just had the brisket chili and it was awesome.i probably/ really/ almost gave our visit 5 stars but it did take a minute to order but who cares... actually changing it to 5 stars.
it's back! &nbsp;it's really, really, really back! &nbsp;the original must was a place that encapsulated so many fond memories of downtown, a dependable <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> gathering spot and the home base for the forging of lifelong friendships. &nbsp;downtown has gone through a lot of turnover, adjustments, and settling in, but the must is a place that comes up in conversation quite often... &quot;ah, i wish the must was still around.&quot; and now they are!!!! &nbsp;it's bigger, swankier, snazzier, cozier... but it still has the full essence and heart of the original must. &nbsp;this is my first choice when downtown and this is the place to be.
i am so <span class="highlighted">happy</span> in my heart now that the must...is back!!i used to be a huge fan of the old location and i love the new spot more. it's roomier, but with great service and the same favorite items on the must menu. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is everyday until 7pm!we had the smashed tators, the mac and cheese (recommend), hush puppies, the sliders and a round of black sangrias. everything was mighty tasty. &nbsp;this is my very favorite spot in dtla because the food and drinks are extensive but good, casual and unpretentious and comfortable. if i lived in the area, i would probably be here at least three times a week. come with your friends and just kick it. i am so <span class="highlighted">happy</span> it's back!
the best part about this place is it's ambiance. &nbsp;the beautifully low lit outdoor patio is hard to resist. &nbsp;the drinks have been good all three times i've been. &nbsp;i've had beer and mixed cocktails. &nbsp;the food is good, but not great, however. &nbsp;i've had the arugula salad, avocado salad, smashed latkes and cholo fried rice. &nbsp;the cholo friend rice is the best but i think it's really overpriced for what it is. &nbsp;this place is one i'd rather go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> - to drink and snack. &nbsp;don't forget to take a trip to the bathroom - the wallpaper is amazing!
i've been here 5x since feb... i must like it! &nbsp; turned others onto it. &nbsp; &nbsp;good ambience, solidly reliable food with creative flair (we ordered extra side of the fried green tomatoes that come with an entree ). &nbsp; the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is excellent with nice selection of wine, bubbles, brews. &nbsp; &nbsp;the location is part of the appeal. &nbsp;wedged between old bank district and skid row. &nbsp; scheck it ouuuutttttt.....!!
first off, the mac and cheese is the best i have ever had! that said the last time i was there it was taken off the menu (boo!) i've heard it's now on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu so i suppose it's still worth checking out. unfortunately this place is really hit or miss, i either love the food or it's to the point of being inedible. the mac and cheese though, it's the tops!
i was at an open house near glassell park a few weeks ago and it was clear the neighbors were none too excited about the prospect a white guy in skinny jeans getting out of a prius blasting kcrw on sunday mornings moving in. i knew the look on their faces because it's the same look on my face the first time i see a bar or restaurant downtown, especially further east. there's an arms race to ruin downtown before it fully understands its changing body. (side note: don't get tattoos when you're 18.)the must is an awesome neighbor. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is solid. it's especially great on sunday early evening when you want to get out of your place and just chill. it draws a great, eclectic crowd. i've been sucked into paying full price for drinks after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> not because i'm so drunk but because i'm having so much fun talking to other people from the neighborhood. i've only done drinks, so no clue about food. always looks delicious.
this place is great! we came here and had the dinela menu along with some beers and the sangria. the food was amazing! the inside ambiance is fun, too bad i can't say the same about the sketchy looking neighborhood it's in. they've got a nice bar area as well as outside seating. there's convenient parking all over the place. the service was amazing thanks to nicole, she was very friendly and insightful. &nbsp;i will def be coming back here to try their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu.
oh my fucking god! to hell with animal, to hell with little tokyo (if you want ramen and you're not local, go to torrance or costa mesa for better and less crowds)..... a big space, nice bar, amazing downstairs adventure to the restrooms (including zoltar), $13 bone marrow that blow animal to shit, and a killer <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that includes a $6 duck liver mousse that is liberally to die for.... and a bloody mary served with the world's greatest peppercini -- stuffed with feta chesse (move over, blue cheese olives) by a columbian that is easy on the eyes &nbsp;and a kitchen staff that knows excellence. amazing.
i love a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> that lasts til 7!house sparkling - generous pour. &nbsp;it was described as &quot;very drinkable&quot; and indeed it was - i had two! &nbsp;5/5. $5 each.eggplant dip - &nbsp;almost gross it was so bad. &nbsp;i am not an eggplant fan in general though... therefore the cold pur&eacute;ed variety is unlikely to please my palate. pita chips looked like they had seasoning on them- not so! &nbsp;they were dry and flavorless. &nbsp;1/5 &nbsp;$5smashed latkes - tasty! i do wish they came with sour cream instead of ketchup but they were a nice change up from the usual truffle fries offered everywhere. &nbsp;came out hot and fresh with a nice fried crust - yum. 5/5chicken wings - reportedly good, looked a bit slimy- i didn't have any. &nbsp;not breaded. they come in a little bowl all piled on top of each other. ambiance - adorable. &nbsp;open air and the patio is off a side street so there's not much traffic and it's very pleasant to sit out there. &nbsp;musical stylings of 1960-70s r&amp;b artists like stevie wonder and gladys knight intermixed with modern songs such as mark ronson doing a cover of toxic = a hip and eclectic soundtrack. indoors the booths were lined with racks of magazines to peruse. &nbsp;unique idea! &nbsp; 5/5
first time here, thanks to yelp! did not disappoint. went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, and had the white sangaria, delicious! had some mac&amp;cheese and mashed tater tots, also really good! entr&eacute;e was the &quot;cholo fried rice,&quot; (carnitas, rice, half cooked egg, jalape&ntilde;o, and avocado) amazing! very attentive staff, overall great!
really had a good time, i can't really comment on the food too much. we had two appetizers, yup that was why we can't comment on the food too much. what we did have was good comfort food, the slider with mushroom was tasty. the blackberry sangria was very good, and the staff were awesome upbeat and <span class="highlighted">happy</span>, we had to tell other people that we have already been helped as many others were asking if we were ok. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was good, drinks were great prices were awesome and location is cool. ate later at baco mercat around the corner and waaaaaaay too salty. cheers!
so beyond <span class="highlighted">happy</span> that this place is back. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> everyday - heck yeah! the appetizers are delicious, tonight we had the jalape&ntilde;o hush puppies, mac and cheese and the pretzel bites. this was enough food for the 2 of us. i had both sangrias and they were mighty tasty and a big size for 5 bucks. the service was great. can't wait for my next visit.
can't speak for the rest of the menu...but you must try that mac n' cheese.dtla is becoming more and more gentrified (hey, i'm not here to argue whether it's a good or bad thing). but i was shopping on a saturday on the dirty outskirts for cheap sunglasses, then i see this nice building looking me dead in the eye.i step in--it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, so i order a brew ($3 bucks...i think) and mac n' cheese. overall, the menu looks pretty tasty, and the establishment itself is very clean. however, it's dog friendly (at least on the patio), and i don't like that...unsanitary to me.
came here for a co workers birthday lunch maybe around 1130 on a weekday. service was super slow i don't know if this is because they just opened or what. the menu options didn't leave me with a comfortable feeling of what to choose. i felt the cesar salad was safe. although my co workers were adventurous ordering different items. i wasn't a fan of the salad and my co workers weren't too enthused with their options either saying it wasn't very flavorful but everyone's tastebuds are different. if i come back here again it may just be for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for some cocktails but i don't plan on having any lunch or dinner.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and sampled the jalapeno hush puppies and also the famous cholo fried rice. the hush puppies were standard. &nbsp;tasted a tad floury and breaded.the fried rice was nothing to rave about either. &nbsp;at the $12 price point i expected a larger portion and a tad more innovation. &nbsp;it was definitely decent, hence the three stars.
with everything averaged, &nbsp;i would say this place is a 4/5. there is not separate lot for parking here, &nbsp;so that's a major inconvenience. &nbsp;however, &nbsp;if you're lucky there are about 3-4 metered parking spots right across the small street from the must. &nbsp;we didn't make a reservation on a saturday night, &nbsp;but they didn't make a big deal out of it. &nbsp;we were seated right away. we got a round of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks and i must say their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink menu is pretty superb. wine, &nbsp;beer, &nbsp;vodka, &nbsp;gin, &nbsp;whiskey &nbsp;etc. &nbsp;they seriously have something for everyone. i got the mac n cheese ($6) for starters and would say i wouldn't recommend this. &nbsp;it was salty and greasy and the cheese flavor was lost. &nbsp;it's mac and cheese, &nbsp;once the cheese flavor is gone, &nbsp;it lost its identity. &nbsp;it is topped with goldfish as crumbles and wasn't a big fan. &nbsp;the cholo fried rice ($15) was very delicious though. &nbsp;i chose the tofu one. the fried rice has a very nice flavor mixed due to the cilantro &nbsp;salsa verde and avocado mixed in..this is all topped with an egg. i asked for siracha hot sauce, but they only had louisiana hot sauce, &nbsp;which actually complimented the fried rice nicely. the avocado salad ($14) comes with grilled shrimp and watermelon radish, &nbsp;fried capers and upland cress. this salad was pretty forgettable because of the cholo fried rice. &nbsp;the servers were so friendly and gave our table vouchers for brunch/lunch and it's 15%off. &nbsp;can't wait to try some other dishes!
i came here last week on a weekday for an early dinner. &nbsp;no reservations, and my party of three was seated instantly. &nbsp;they weren't too busy, so we had our choice between the patio and seating inside.our 6 p.m. dinner was timed perfectly with <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (3-7 p.m. on weekends(!), 4-7 p.m. on weekdays). &nbsp;we started with the mac and cheese, the jalape&ntilde;o hush puppies, and the schnitzel (basically sliders).then we moved onto entrees. &nbsp;we got the cholo fried rice and the must soy hamburger helper. &nbsp;overall, i was a bigger fan of the hh than dinner. &nbsp;at $5 for the hh snacks and $5 for some drinks, it's a good bargain. &nbsp;the mac and cheese was okay - i liked that they had goldfish crackers crumbs as a topping, but other than that, the actual dish itself was pretty standard. &nbsp;i liked the hush puppies a lot more. &nbsp;they come with honey butter. &nbsp;the combination is flawless! &nbsp;the schnitzel was okay, too, but a little expensive at $3 for two or three bites. &nbsp;the fried mushroom, however, was thinly sliced and very crispy.the cholo fried rice did not live up to the hype. &nbsp;the carnitas were a nice touch, as was the fried egg and the avocado, but it didn't do enough to justify the price tag. &nbsp;i felt similarly about the hamburger helper. our waitress was right - i couldn't taste that the hamburger helper was fake meat, but that didn't mean the dish was good.service: &nbsp;our waitress was very friendly. &nbsp;she made small talk with us, checked in on us frequently, and overall made our dining experience more enjoyable. &nbsp;the busboys were very good about refilling our water too. &nbsp;a note about the space - it's new and nice. &nbsp;the walls are lined with wine bottles, and it's just dark enough that the restaurant is kind of intimate but not so dark you can't see. &nbsp;also, on the way to the bathroom downstairs, there's a small room that looks like it can be booked for private events. &nbsp;it looks like a lot of fun; there's even a movie projector and screen!bottom line: &nbsp;come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
this might be my new favorite spot in dtla. &nbsp;3-7 <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, to die for smashed tater tots, a cool outdoor patio, a bartender (jason) that doesn't hate his job (at least not apparently) and hilarious wallpaper in the ladies room. &nbsp;what more do you want? &nbsp;our drinks were good (white peach sangria $5 on hh) and strong. &nbsp;the smashed tater tots were stupid good. &nbsp;jason, the bartender was hilarious and has an awesome sad music mix on his ipod. &nbsp;the vibe is cool, laid back and friendly. &nbsp;shocking for la, right? &nbsp;zoltar scares the crap out of you on the way to the underground bathroom (you've been warned) and that might kill your buzz for a second, but then you come back up and order another cheap drink and pick up where you left off. &nbsp;i'm definitely coming back for brunch and more sinead o'connor.
this place is situated in a not-so-great area of dtla but the restaurant itself, and the mural of audrey hepburn next to it, was a great contrast. i just slightly missed <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and the bartender would not budge on letting us have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. service was not so great when i was here. my friend and i weren't really checked up on and we had to flag our bartender down to get cups of water. the black sangria reminded me something one would drink on a juice diet. it tasted like blueberry, acai and blackberry. it was very thick and did not taste good. my friend and i figured we'd drink it since we already ordered it. i'm pleased to say that i at least got a good buzz from it. the smashed tater tots tasted ordinary and the cholo fried rice was good but nothing amazing. the star of the night had to be the mac n cheese for me! i love mac n cheese and the mac n cheese here was so gooey and cheesy. topping it with goldfish crackers only made it more amazing! what a great idea!the atmosphere was very chill and laid-back. i liked the outdoor patio and the scattered candles softly lighting up the place. however, for the most part, i found the food to be ordinary with the exception of the mac n cheese. the black sangria was not flavorful at all and customer service was almost non-existent.
okay-- so food was fine. had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tots and hush puppies- they were above friday's standards but what was really bizarre is the staff... just a weird group of odballs &nbsp;that don't seem to really want to serve you. no smiles. no &quot;how are yous&quot; no &quot;can i help you&quot; not rude- but actually worse- like completely could care less. and the crowd was just loud and awkward and uncomfortable. really a cringe worthy experience all around. mediocre food. awful service. will not go back.
i bring friends here a lot now, and it's always solid! there wine list is great and their servers are always very knowledgeable of the items on their list. they have some good beer selections as well. i've tried the cholo fried rice and mac n cheese and smashed tots which are all very good and i can see the reason why they are popular menu items. i love the avocado salad as well :)they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which i recommend! the only thing i don't like about this place is that it's dark as frick at night for dinner service. like why does it have to be so dark? i can't see anything. and sometimes the music is a little loud. these are minor details. great place to go with friends! 5 stars!
coworker recommend this place and after seeing her picture of the cauliflower i decided to check it out. there was 5 of us in our party. got there at 6:30pm and found out they were still doing <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!! the boys got a few drinks and i ordered the smashed tater tots, the jalape&ntilde;o hush puppies and the gooey mac and cheese. i did my homework and came prepared in terms of what to order. the smashed tater tots were a little salty for my taste. it would have been good if it wasn't so salty. the jalape&ntilde;o hush puppies came with honey butter and were just so so. the mac and cheese was delicious! they top it with goldfish crackers which gave it a unique twist. we ordered the roasted half head of cauliflower, cholo fried rice with carnitas, beet loaf and the duck sloppy joe served with mixed greens. i would highly recommend the duck sloppy joe. the cauliflower was good but i did not like the chimichurri sauce. the cholo fried rice was a favorite amongst the table. i was disappointed with the beet loaf. i am a huge fan of beets but this was a fail. service was good. we had a super sweet waitress. bill came out to $25 a person. not bad. we did not do dessert since we had plans to check out mcconnell's fine ice cream. definitely be back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! there is a parking lot next to it, otherwise street parking. we only had to circle twice before finding something.
a lovely lady introduced me to this place last evening, and i have to admit it's a nice little place, good seating array, but i have to admit the two person booths are a bit tight, my knees barely fit under the table. &nbsp;i know i'm over 6 feet tall and everything but i'm not shaq either! &nbsp;great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> choices, i love the sangria, and the jalapeno hush puppies with remoulade are really tasty. &nbsp;now, having said that...so since i have southern roots i was quite curious what 'yo momma's chicken' tasted like. &nbsp;that...was not what i was expecting. &nbsp;i guess my momma was a yank? &nbsp;the tastes kind of conflicted with the each other, in my opinion when it comes to a dish with that name, keep the flavor simple. &nbsp;the server asked how the food was and i didn't really want to lie to him, and he could tell it wasn't too great, so he insisted i try the chicken pot pie instead. &nbsp;well, i decided to take him up on his offer, and this dish? &nbsp;wasn't really doing much for me either. &nbsp;crap. &nbsp;i really want to like these dishes, and others may enjoy them, but they just weren't doing it for me! &nbsp;the potatoes and carrots tasted boiled instead of baked, the biscuit was too dry, and the chicken wasn't anything to write home about. &nbsp;so why did i give 4 stars? &nbsp;let's review:-1 &nbsp;stellar service all around, from the bartenders, waiters, servers, and busboys.-2 &nbsp;amazing appetizers and drinks, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> was a great value also.-3 &nbsp;even though i wasn't enjoying the food, i can tell it was well prepared and effort was put into it.i'm sure on the next visit i'll find a dish more to my liking, so yes the next time i'm in dtla i shall give it another whirl.
this place is legit. &nbsp; the ambiance is perfect - they have a great outdoor patio with strung lights, a cool indoor/outdoor bar, and really nice inside seating as well. &nbsp;it has a warm, creative vibe.the food is very good. &nbsp;the latkas were a great appetizer, and the cholo rice was very good. &nbsp;great black sangria with real berries.the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great - 3-7pm daily.parking was fairly easy for me on a friday night around 6:30pm. &nbsp;there are meters that are about $3/<span class="highlighted">hour</span>, but are free after 8pm. &nbsp;there are also some lots with flat rates of about $5-$9.service was great - attentive and friendly. &nbsp;the old bank district is a great downtown area to check out. &nbsp;i wouldn't walk too far, though - it gets really rough really fast just a few streets down from the area with all the restaurants. &nbsp;the best thing about the must is the gluten free options (so many!) &nbsp;they also label their menu so you know what is vegetarian and what is gluten-free - yes, thank you. &nbsp;the gluten-free stuff is great, too - not just like a salad or a fruit bowl. ;) &nbsp;the latkas are gluten free; they have meatballs that are gluten free - lots of stuff that usually wouldn't be gluten free. &nbsp;bravo! &nbsp;i will definitely be back.
hidden gem just off the old bank district. this place was awesome and i can't wait to go back!it's right at the edge of a sketchy area (los angeles street) but i felt totally safe here so if you're concerned about that, don't be.the drinks were fresh and they even garnished my greyhounds with a grapefruit slice. our server, armando was awesome and dealt with our drunken loudness so thank you for that :)i was with a big group so we ordered a bunch of stuff and shared it. the cholo fried rice was nothing short of amazing! smashed tater tots, mac &amp; cheese,&amp; the chili also stood out. i would go back for any one of those.there is a parking lot right next door and a big structure right on main &amp; winston so thankfully parking isn't an issue here.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> lasts until 7 so that automatically deserves at least half an additional star.i will definitely be back for brunch as the menu looks great!
this is a good looking place right on the edge of a questionable neighborhood. they have a good amount of outdoor seating including a portion of the bar.we came by for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. we tried a few of their options. the jalape&ntilde;o hush puppies were solid. you get a decent number and the honey butter adds a nice accent. the sharp cheddar gooey mac &amp; cheese is also fairly good. you get a good sized bowl. it is gooey and has good flavor. the goldfish crumble topping is a nice touch too. the last thing we tried was the drew's bomb brisket chili. the chili tasted pretty darn good. i just wish there was a little less hominy in it. they pack in a good amount of brisket, but it was lost on me because of all the hominy. i do not dislike hominy, i just do not want it to dominate the dish from a texture perspective.overall this is a cool place to meet for drinks and appetizers. i would just feel better about it if it was a few blocks further west. i realize that is not what people want to hear, but it is reality.
i love going to wine bars where the employees know their stuff but aren't super pretentious about wines. like, don't serve me box wine but i'm not paying $80 for a glass of beaujolais because the grapes were crushed by toddlers in the south of france. after going to the california science center to see the dead sea scrolls i had a hankering for some good wine. the bf found this place which is located down the most random alley in the fashion district. like, as we drove through the fashion district i was trying to think of wine bars but i could only think of random hot dog or falafel carts. when we parked in some random parking lot and walked over i could start to tell how cool the must is. first of all, the music was on point. there were some people that just had to jump up and start dancing and i couldn't even blame them.we sat at the bar and were immediately served. since it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> we worked from that menu. we ordered olives, latkes, and a cheese board. oh, and a couple glasses of wine, of course. we also looked at the cocktail menu and the cocktails looked good. i hate when i'm conflicted. like when i go somewhere looking for wine and then the cocktails look bomb. ugh. first world problems. anyway, the latkes were something special. nicely deep fried and a little salty. l'chaim! the service was awesome and for our second glass the bartender recommended a chilled red that was outstanding. i really liked this place. i just love unstuffy wine bars.
after getting a drink at perch my friends and i wanted some inexpensive food so we walked over to the must. it's in a strange area, where you wouldn't expect to see such a trendy bar. the atmosphere is awesome. interior brick, large patio, high ceilings. we went during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (3-7 daily) on a saturday and there was like no one there which was great! we ordered the french fries ($4), chicken wings ($5), flying dog ipa ($8), and two glasses of the house white wine ($5). the fries were so good, and topped with parmesan. two orders were definitely enough for four people. the boyfriends loved the wings as well. i was skeptical about the house white wine but it turned out to be very refreshing and not too sweet. my only reason for the three stars is the service. our server (who i think was named lauren), was very nice and pleasant at the beginning. when we first sat down she came and took our order quick, and we received our drinks and food relatively fast. but then she kind of disappeared. we got there around 3:30 and didn't leave until about 4:45, and we didn't even order that much. we were on a time constraint and since there weren't that many people at the restaurant there was really no excuse for her to take so long to come check on us. she was a very nice girl though! i'll probably give it another try someday!
we came down to downtown for a concert and were looking for a good place to eat beforehand. the must was a perfect place to stop for early night noshing! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on saturday: awesome! service: incredibly helpful and nice! (the waitress was appropriately funny/snarky in her banter throughout the entire meal) drink selection: many great wine and beer choices with a full bar that we didn't try (the bier milano doppio malto was very yummy!). food: all very good! (the smashed tater tots are a must!) desserts: all looked super good, and we got to enjoy a very good birthday ice cream cake (for free!!! bro-in-laws bday!) and atmosphere: very cool, clean, modern, and warm as well. we would definitely come back!
you must try the must! i kept hearing over and over from the bff about how great it was so i let him bring me here to try it out. walk in, grab a table, and the servers come to you. i didn't catch her name but she was awesome. we arrived during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (daily 4-7 pm) so we got our appetizer at hh price! she also helped him pick out a beer to quench his thirst. while we waited we grabbed some of the board games they have to play!we started off with the latkes (basically they are smashed tater tots). there were plenty and a yummy start. we also ordered the cholo fries rice and the pork pie to share. the portions are large and even though we shared there was food leftover. the cholo fried rice is to die for, with plenty of meat and jalape&ntilde;os! it was hot, yummy, and i was not disappointed. the pork pie, omg, no words can explain how de-lish it was. i wanted to keep eating although my tummy said to stop! for dessert we ended up with the chocolate bar, i absolutely love the honey comb on top. this is perfect for chocolate lovers!parking in la is dreadful but luckily you can park in the lot right next door for about $7. i think the price varies depending on the time and event schedule. the must has a cool vibe, great food, and awesome service! i definitely recommend.
i booked a table for a large group of clients on tuesday the april 28th and they easily accommodated us even when i had to increase the number of people coming at the last minute. &nbsp;super nice on the phone which is not always the case at some restaurants. &nbsp;the waitress was adorable (nicole-i think) and very attentive, even though she ran the whole place on her own that night. &nbsp;it wasn't super crowded so it was a perfect time to take a group of 14 at 6:30. &nbsp;everyone enjoyed the ambiance and food. &nbsp;the talk at the end of the evening was the cute wallpaper in the bathroom of a girl on a hot dog! &nbsp;the 2 owners are women and the paper was custom made! &nbsp;so cute! &nbsp;i ordered a variety of starters before i got our clients to drunk :). &nbsp;fried cheese curds, brussel sprouts, lamb meatballs, and mushroom toast and all were so delicious! &nbsp;cholo fried rice was a hit with a few of the vegetarians including me! &nbsp;fun place with a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu! &nbsp;great for large groups and suited the &quot;coolest fashion clients&quot;. &nbsp;thanks guys! &nbsp;i'll look forward to seeing you again! &nbsp;if your questioning this place, don't! &nbsp;you won't be dissapointed! &nbsp;the only reason for 4 and 5 stars is because my &quot;boss&quot; is a total wine-o and couldn't find a good chardonnay. &nbsp;some unusual offerings like whites from serbia! &nbsp;who knew?! &nbsp;cool though!
i !@#$ing love the must!probably the best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in dt. the beers on tap and wine &nbsp;are excellent. they have a great variety of options and sizes: half-pitchers, half pints, pints and pitchers. they have low-end and high-end drinks so whether you feel like drinking on a budget or balling out on a nice bottle, you can do either at the must. some of my favorite menu options are the schnitzl schlydaz (however you spell it!), pork and beans, beet loaf and all of the salads are great!the place is beautiful on the inside, very well done and it creates a nice atmosphere day or night. the unique options on the menu might have you second-guessing your order at first, but once it arrives at the table you will definitely be <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. i'm a frequent customer so i'm always trying new things and honestly they're all great. the whole staff is so helpful and the service is amazing. the food is delicious and the drinks delightful. this is hands down my favorite bar and restaurant in downtown and i'm loving the new location. it's a great pre-game spot for art walk.
wife had a coworker who raved about the must so we ended up here for dinner with some friends on a thursday night. &nbsp;ordered a few coctails as we waited for our friends to arrive which were all good. &nbsp;don't remember exactly what i ordered but the drinks were pretty good.since it was <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, we opted to order a few appetizers to share while we browsed the menu.we opted for the jalapeno hush puppies <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-must-los-angeles-2#uubxzknmo1pqhlv7nbekiq">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…</a> which were just so so.smashed tater tots <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-must-los-angeles-2#za8o_v0rsnmc7toviykwvw">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…</a>. &nbsp;these were good but were over salted. &nbsp;mac n cheese w/ crushed gold fish crackers on top <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-must-los-angeles-2#ol3vubfzxt-jffcxbwzjeq">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…</a>. &nbsp;this was extremely tasty and was quickly devoured. &nbsp;i loved the texture of the gold fish crackers mixed in. &nbsp;people raved about the cholo fried rice so we ended up ordering it <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-must-los-angeles-2#eprejbkw5ifddagn0ajigw">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…</a>. &nbsp;the fried rice was good but it didn't live up to the hype.beet loaf <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-must-los-angeles-2#zsz52dvau-mmhmojgpihaa">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…</a>. &nbsp;this was only so so and i think its because there's no real meat!duck sloppy joe <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-must-los-angeles-2#usptllw07gw-_mx4wigdmq">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…</a>. &nbsp;probably the best entree that we ordered that night. &nbsp;a must order when coming to dine here!roasted cauliflower <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-must-los-angeles-2#w0r6mtbvdfmohy21-cgayw">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…</a>. &nbsp;perfectly roasted and well seasoned head of cauliflower that comes with a side of chimichurri sauce.
i must've been a fool to not come here sooner i tells ya. so the popular yelper miss mimi d. owed me a nice gourmet meal because i was forced to buy lunch for her this one time, and i opted to try the must since neither one of us had been there. didn't really know what to expect so i went with an open mind and willing to try anything out. first thing i noticed was the location was so off the cut i never would've even seen or noticed this place ever had i been in this area of dtla. without yelp i never would've found it actually. the really awesome mural of audrey hepburn was located on the adjacent wall. &nbsp;apparently the must was reincarnated from a previous location in dtla. &nbsp;i never had the pleasure at that time but i'm glad it came back. we chose to sit in the patio area which was perfect for a summer evening. the restaurant seating inside was dim and had more of a romantic feel. i noticed a lot of board games scattered on this one table for customers to use if they felt they needed any distractions while eating lol i really enjoyed my meal. &nbsp;i had the pork and greens while mimi opted for the shrimp salad. &nbsp;she doesn't particularly like shrimp so she got them on the side (side shrimp) so i ate all of them and they were delicious shrimps hahawhen we had gotten there we caught the tail end of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so capitalized as quickly as we could. &nbsp;the black sangria was awesome. never had a sangria with blackberries before. i liked it more than the peach sangria but that was tasty as well.i must go back soon i feel that i missed out on the cholo fried rice everyone is raving about
awesome ambience on the patio. pricey hit-and-miss food.1. mac n' cheese ($5 hh) - cheesy, thin-gooey, with crushed goldfish crackers on top. good size portion (like a cup of soup), tasty 2. hush puppies ($4 hh) - dense, a-ok but not great, has slivers of jalepeno for a little spice, honey butter was so-so (kinda plastic tasting is that weird?)3. smothered (in chili) hush puppies ($7 hh) - waitress didn't mention the extra charge was when she asked if we wanted it smothered or not... i assumed there would be a charge but when it almost doubles the price you'd think it'd be nice to know. chili should be called saucy brisket instead. 4. blistered peppers and fried anchovies ($8 not on hh) - <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sized portion but normal appetizer price. taste was good but i only got 7 anchovies, smaller than my pinkie finger. peppers were blistered properly - warning some are very spicy others are not :) its kinda like a lotto game of spiciness5. cholo fried rice ($15 +$3 for an extra egg) - came with 1 sunny side up egg, that went well with the warm avocado slices and carnitas (choice of tofu or carnitas in the fried rice). unique blend of flavors, tastes like no other fried rice i've had, good. i like it but the price tag is a little steep- i'd order it again.. better value than the peppers/anchovies6. sangria (choice of white or red) ($5) - i got white, comes with peach slices, and apricot liqueur. good, sweet, and more of a nectar cocktail than a sangria (see photo). thick, kinda like they used kern's nectar in it. i like it! (but don't expect traditional sangria)
&quot;they have the same bathroom wallpaper as before- with girls riding hot dogs!&quot; &nbsp;that was one of my silly fangirl statements from last night, at the newly reincarnated must. &nbsp;i loved the old must- i even celebrated a birthday there once. &nbsp;so i was incredibly excited when i heard that they reopened in a new location downtown. &nbsp;the old must was great; the new must is excellent! &nbsp;the new space is larger and more upscale, with an indoor/outdoor bar, lots of booths, and a patio area. &nbsp;they also expanded and upgraded the food menu, with comfort food options like chicken pot pie, beef back ribs, and &quot;schnitzel schlydaz&quot;. &nbsp;they still have the fluffernutter dessert, if you were worried! &nbsp;we didn't eat there last night, so i'll have to review the food later. &nbsp;i love my black sangria. &nbsp;it was just as delicious as i remembered, with lots of blueberries and blackberries. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deals are great, with appetizers and several wine and beer options, but i always end up with the $5 sangrias. i also found out that the must has its own wine label now, and our bartender was nice enough to give me a taste. &nbsp; a cocktail menu is in the works, since this new must has a full bar. &nbsp;our bartender, casey, was very cute and he took great care of us. &nbsp;i'm so <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to have one of my favorite spots back, and i'm already craving another black sangria!
our friends wanted to meet downtown for dinner so it was the perfect opportunity for me to try the must that i had bookmarked a while ago. &nbsp;unfortunately, the downtown spots that i go to are usually for lunch mon.-fri. &amp; they're not open for lunch during the work week. &nbsp;maybe they would consider opening for lunch on fridays? &nbsp;just a thought. &nbsp;anyway we are here for a saturday dinner. &nbsp;we got there first since google maps got our friends lost. &nbsp;one quick phone call to me set them back on track. &nbsp;we all found street parking without a problem. &nbsp;the decor is a laid back bar vibe w/ indoor &amp; outdoor seating. &nbsp;we sat inside due to an engagement party taking place. &nbsp;she was a cute bride to be w/ a cute vintage looking dress on. &nbsp;oh sorry...got distracted...back to the restaurant. &nbsp;we were initially seated in a tiny booth but my husband &amp; i asked to be moved across the way since we were a party of 4 &amp; the booth looked comfortable for 3. &nbsp;a few minutes later our friends arrived. &nbsp;we reviewed the menu &amp; decided on drinks. &nbsp;when my husband asked about a pitcher of napa smith pale ale our serverdanielle says that it's on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu &amp; that it would be cheaper by the pint. what a sweetheart! &nbsp;unfortunately the beer i wanted was not on the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu. &nbsp;i ordered the telegraph&quot;prime meridian&quot; a belgium style brown ale w/ dry hops. &nbsp;it was really tasty. &nbsp;for our starters we got jalape&ntilde;o hush puppies, ribbon fries &amp; smashed tater tots. &nbsp;the smashed tater tots were my favorite. &nbsp;my husband also ordered the smoked half head of cauliflower that was smothered in worcestershire &amp; dijon mustard. &nbsp;yummy! my first instinct was to order the cholo fried rice...maybe it reminded me of my childhood neighborhood but i just had some amazing carnitas sopes the night before so i opted for the chicken pot pie a la mode. &nbsp;it was o.k. &nbsp;maybe the goat cheese was a little overpowering. &nbsp;my husband had the pork pie. &nbsp;the flavors were good but too salty. &nbsp;our friend marc had the drewben which he thoroughly enjoyed. &nbsp;i had a bite &amp; it was the best of the entrees that we ordered. &nbsp;our friend randy ordered the beet loaf...he said that it was between that &amp; the soy hamburger. &nbsp;i had to check his forehead because he is normally a carnivore. &nbsp;he asked danielle her honest opinion &amp; she suggested the beet loaf. &nbsp;randy enjoyed it. &nbsp;i had a bite &amp; although i like beets, i would get a real meat loaf any day! &nbsp;the service was excellent &amp; we would come back to try other options. &nbsp;they have a nice selection of beers on draught &amp; although i would never order it, they have a 40 oz. old english that comes in a paper bag. &nbsp;funny!
my 3rd time here and i will no longer be coming back. i came here yesterday on father's day with a group of 14 and was very surprised the restaurant was not packed for dinner (well, after this experience i'm not surprise the restaurant wasn't packed). therefore we were seated right away without having to make reservations. 1. our waitresses was a mess. please get it together.they did not take our orders according to where we were seated. when i usually go to restaurants the waiter/waitress would know who ordered what. nope, not here. you would think they would do that because we have such a large party. orders came out and the waitress did not even tell us what it was. for example a few people on the able got sliders, but our table was so big and the other end of the table ended up eating the sliders i ordered. 2. not only did our order did not come out. the manager on duty, which was the chef came out to talk to us. he was not only very very defensive, but we felt that he was trying to prove us wrong by showing us his little receipt order notes stating that everything he cooked came out. we felt that he was trying to argue with us. he was not very apologetic, we had to explain ourselves over and over again about how our orders got mixed up and one of our orders never came out. very poor customer service. the chef made it even worst. was he trying to tell us that we were lying to him? the whole situation was handled very poorly. the must, please learn how to talk to your customers. after all, customer loyalty/service is a must right? walked out of here, frustrated, still hungry and not <span class="highlighted">happy</span>. &nbsp;3. we got here at 6pm on a sunday and it was still happyhour. ordered the wings... and had no idea it was only 2 wings per a order. 2 little wings for 6 bucks?! no thanks! i can go to costco and get a whole chicken! got the cholo fried rice... it was very good but for $16 dollars... expect to still be hungry. happyhour menu is not impressive at all. beers are still $6-$8 each. i would totally suggest to go else where if you are looking for happyhour. would not recommend coming here if you have a large group. they will charge you 20% gratuity with groups 6 or more. would not recommend <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or dinner. been here for brunch and it was alright. if you would like to try new restaurants for dinela...dont come here.
what a fun place--just steps from skid row in hipster la. the restaurant is on a small street in la, with plenty of street or lot parking nearby. the block slopes downhill toward los angeles street, so the restaurant is slightly elevated from street level with a bar and interior seating. but the patio is the bomb! we sat outside enjoying the early evening breeze and views of street art on the walls across the street. they have a nice <span class="highlighted">happy</span> menu of drinks and snacks. we indulged in the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks, but hit the regular menu for its unique and tasty morsels. our group of four shared the smashed tots and chimichurri cauliflower, both delicious and unusual. the restaurant has a small, but eclectic group of larger plates as well, which are vegan and omnivore- friendly. my veg friend couldn't resist ordering the beet loaf, which was made of red beets and quinoa, sitting in a delicious pool of mashed potatoes. my wife had the green bucatini, which was a think spaghetti-like pasta covered in a pesto and enhanced by salty, delicious sea beens. my other friend and i both had the sockeye salmon, which was served in a broth of manila clams and accompanied by a toasted piece of french bread and those tasty sea beans as well. be sure to ask your server for a spoon to sop up the broth. unfortunately, we were too full to sample the fluffernutter pie, which brings you right back to your childhood. much better than vegemite i might add. nicole, our server, was just the right amount of fun. there are plenty of good restaurants on the block from blossom to baco mercat, but you ought to, you should, heck you must try the must.
we've must have come on a really off day for the must because so many things weren't offered on the menu. good thing we were a light hearted crowd and laughed off our luck on not being able to try most of the things that are hyped on yelp. 1) when we walked in, we were told the bottomless sorbet mimosas weren't being offered... my heart sank because that's the whole reason why i wanted to come! but then the server comes back and says, &quot;just kidding&quot;! -_-2) we wanted to order the cholo fried rice and the french toast...and were told they weren't offering those today so we regrouped and decided to do the flutternutter for dessert....after which we finished our food, the server tells us....&quot;we're out of the flutternutter&quot;. 3) they were also out of hot sauce....eggs with no hot sauce??? (=() out of the samplings of the food i was &nbsp;able to order, it was pretty good. my biscuit on my eggs benedict was kind of a tad too hard though. breakfast potatoes were roasted and seasoned well. &nbsp;the sorbet mimosas were tasty and not too sweet. &nbsp;i could sip on those for <span class="highlighted">hours</span>.my other brunchmates weren't too <span class="highlighted">happy</span> with their corned beef hash though. it was kind of just corned beef served with a side of potatoes. not very hashy. nonetheless, props to our server for keeping our bottomless mimosas refilled and constantly checking in. i guess it wasn't his fault someone forgot to go shopping in the kitchen to restock for memorial day brunch.should i come back and give it another chance?

they've changed their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> recently:their 35 cent martini is only offered on thursdays during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (until 7), and they have about 5 items on their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu at a reduced price. &nbsp;all mixed drinks are $8 or under.place is rad, and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is perfect for college students looking for something fancier then the usual dive bar
my favorite spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and meeting interesting people. lots of good memories made here. buyer beware: 75% of the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> patrons are attorneys.. i'm not hating.. just stating a fact. must try their 35 cent <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> martinis :)
great lounge. spacious, and the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is pretty phenomenal. pricey but what can you expect. lines are long on the weekends.
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! &nbsp;it definitely is different and marcos tello is an excellent mixologist. &nbsp;beware of the 35 cents martini because it will definitely knock you out if you're not ready for it. &nbsp;i wish the food menu was better, but you can't beat the sweet potato fries with a burger, but the prices for food are better at other <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spots.
cheap <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drinks, unique decor, mixed downtown crowd, what more do you need? oh, better bar food.
amazing 30's style club. &nbsp;love the atmosphere. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> gin drinks are yum.
i have to give it up for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal. a cocktail for under $1 and a little cup of tomato soup and &nbsp;grilled cheese wedge. yeah, very cool.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is fantastic....the &quot;bailout&quot; is a whiskey drink for 35 cents that rocks. &nbsp;also, the soup kitchen is &nbsp;a nice touch.
great ambiance! &nbsp;fun, interesting shows! &nbsp;a good place to meet up with friends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, dinner, or just a fun night out. &nbsp;wednesdays are my favorites!
a ton of fun, trendy, and the perfect la bar. strict dress code for the guys tho. try <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on friday and stay for the friday night crowd.
i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with a cousin, and loved it. &nbsp;it was happening on a thursday night with live music. &nbsp;i would definitely recommend and come back.
i've only been here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (not into the lounge club scene), and it's awesome. i love the classy decor and its attentive bartenders. the atmosphere is hard to beat. it's quiet, classy and calm, just the way i like it. the mistress drink was delicious- a sweet fizzy cocktail made with vodka, hibiscus liqueur, lemon juice, and prosecco. i hadn't had the chance to try the food, but will return soon to get my share. highly recommended for la visitors and with co-workers for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> downtown, hands down.great drinks, great looking people and great staff!
speak-easy, with entrance in ally-way and extensive cocktail list! &nbsp;great ambiance, dark industrial steampunk meets art nouveau. during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (5pm-7pm) the crowds were no were near overwhelming. ordered a cocktail as soon as i walked in. tip: - <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> 5pm-7pm wed.- fri., 35 cent cocktails &amp; $5 bar food.
there are no words to properly describe the edison. &nbsp;there are no pictures or video that could remotely do it justice. &nbsp;i've always heard about it here.came in super early last night ( 5:30 .) &nbsp;i walked around the entire place twice. &nbsp;it is huge and beyond gorgeous.speak-easy feel. &nbsp;details detail details. &nbsp;wherever a little lighting could go, there it was. &nbsp;ambiance city, people. &nbsp;and immaculate. &nbsp;and what architecture. &nbsp;jeesh.from the door man, to the hostess and server- all were super friendly. &nbsp;i had a delicious cocktail. &nbsp;okay two. -the edison. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices on cocktails are 30% off of all that are 14 and lower.also on <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i really enjoyed the shrimp cocktail -$9.i haven't had one *this* fantastic since living in new england. &nbsp;firm, huge, fresh, phenomenal cocktail sauce. &nbsp;perfect amount of kick. &nbsp;i cannot wait to come back.
the first time i came here it was for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with my cousin. it's a really neat place inside...1920s theme with black n white movies showing on the walls, live jazz on certain nights, waiters and waitresses all dress in that era. the decor alone is worth coming to check out. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a-okay. certain drinks are discounted by a couple bucks and the food prices stay the same (~$9 for fries!!!). though they do give you a $1 cocktail ticket for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. it'll buy you whatever drink the bartender chose as the drink special for that night, last time i went it was like a whiskey sour of sorts. real cool place to catch up with a friend or friends, not so much a place to pick up on chicks or guys really. it's a sophisticated lounge with a hip and fun old time flair.
the website looks like the video game myst with flip through menus and music. i am going wednesday night! their <span class="highlighted">hours</span> have changed now open wed. through sat. (wed-fri 5-2, sat 8-2). they have a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> now. (pause) beginning at the time most other <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> close down. this must be investigated for the sake of science.
came for a friend's birthday and loved it. had to go back. go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on thursday or friday. you wont regret it. i am not gonna say much but have the dude shine your shoes. money!
never had a dull moment at edison. very diverse and mature crowd. weekends can get really packed so try to arrive early. i've also had <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> there and the crowd was great! there was a live band when i went and people even started dancing! i don't usually see that on the weekends. did i metion the sliders are delicious but at $16 each plate. drinks are average priced very much comparable to hollywood. great spot for celebration, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or just to hang out with friends.
absolutely loved how huge and classy this place is! lots of different private and large areas to converse. &nbsp;$1single drink and one quarter cheese sandwich for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;had a great time with friends.
i think the edison is sexy.i went here awhile back on a weekday and during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. this place has a burlesque theme and on this particular day there was a burlesque dancer! her performance was cool to watch.we got there early enough to sit and have drinks and some food at a table before the party who reserved it arrived. the tables are very small and circular. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> menu has good prices but the portions are really small. i remember their fries being delicioussssssssss!! the drink were strong, i had a few glasses of white wine, and i left buzzing for sure!this place is really dark for a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot...i felt like vampires were gonna jump out after a certain time. however, i had a good time. i met a lot of good people, mostly people who had just gotten off work and were still in their professional clothes. i would definitely recommend checking out <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with a couple of friends whose conversation you enjoy. dress up, or don't :)

this review is for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> only! &nbsp;great spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> with &nbsp;a couple girlfriends. &nbsp;arrived at 5pm on a friday, no line, no hassle, no cover. &nbsp;we walked in and the hostess gave us a token. &nbsp;i didn't really get it at first but later we gave our waitress the token and in return received a 35 cent martini!! nice! the martini of the day was a vodka gimlet, which was prepared nicely. &nbsp;a little on the sweet wide, but it was nice and strong. &nbsp;best welcome ever!they also had $5 appetizers during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;ordered the calamari and sliders (both came with generous serving of fries). &nbsp;both items were good, and the regular and sweet potato fries were good as well. &nbsp;only thing is the &quot;sliders&quot; actually was a &quot;slider&quot; ... 1 slider. &nbsp;yes, the drinks here are expensive. &nbsp;but during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> it's 40% off any drink $13 or more. &nbsp;that's $7.80 for a nice fancy fairly strong drink. &nbsp;not the cheapest, but not bad. &nbsp;had the mistress and bermuda kiss. &nbsp;both tasted nicely and weren't too strong or weak. &nbsp;2 appetizers and 4 drinks later (including our nearly free drink) the bill was $27. &nbsp;not bad! service was mediocre. &nbsp;while the waitress was very friendly and <span class="highlighted">happy</span> to help us when we ordered, she didn't really come by often. &nbsp;maybe 3 times in 2 <span class="highlighted">hours</span>? &nbsp;it was kind of busy so maybe she had too many tables. &nbsp;worst come to worst, you can just order from the bar.i found the ambiance and decor to be really unique. &nbsp;dim lit, lots of different little rooms and caveats, waitresses in flapper style dresses, french music playing, you get a feel of mystery and sophistication. &nbsp;there weren't many seats available for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> as most of the tables were reserved for dinners. &nbsp;but we found a couple comfy chairs. &nbsp;if you're looking for a spot to be rowdy or a place to get drunk for cheap, this isn't really the place. &nbsp;but if you want to catch up with a couple friends, talk and relax over some drinks in dtla.... i definitely recommend this place. &nbsp;saw some people eating dinner here...not sure about that but will def be back for another <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!
beautiful place, great atmosphere, good drinks, and friendly service.came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a friday after work with some co-workers. &nbsp;getting here that early, it was pretty empty and we walked right in. &nbsp;service was efficient and attentive. &nbsp;they have a pretty good signature drink selection, and some decent beers on tap. &nbsp;didn't try a lot of food, but the fries and soft pretzel were delicious, and great to snack on between drinks.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is a pretty good deal, but if it's not <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, it can be pretty pricey. &nbsp;also, a note to anyone who comes here straight from work and who carries a laptop or work bag, they require you to check those bags before entering the bar and charge you a few dollars for it. &nbsp;this wasn't a huge problem for my co-workers, but they probably would have left their things at the office if they'd known this. &nbsp;overall, the service and ambiance here are top-notch, and we had a great time. &nbsp;we'll definitely be back again for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> soon!
stopped in for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> last night. great atmosphere, dim lighting, high ceilings,historic setting that is practically a museum. drinks and beer selection was good, and the kobe sliders were great.
this is defintely a &quot;company card&quot; type place. you know the place where you can enjoy ridiculously priced food and drinks while enjoying a vibe that you wouldn't normally do on your own dime. picture mcormick's at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and you pretty much have this joint.the upside to this place is the decor and its uniqueness especially in la. the downside is the prices (14 bucks a pop for cocktails though <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is half price) and that you have to pay for parking (5 bones--though the parking garage is relatively close). service is a bit erratic. our waitress was so overworked, she was practically running from table to table so if you're going to eat here--be patient.and oh yeah beware the attire requirement. they're serious about it though they seem more lax during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> versus later on in the night.
my friend took me here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. drinks were ehh...i'm not impressed. but its a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> deal 35 cents for a drink and you get a ticket for a free (albeit extremely small) cup of tomato soup and a 1/4 of a grilled cheese sandwich. i am not a fan of grilled cheese, but this grilled cheese was good.what makes this place is the ambiance. it looks like an old powerhouse, complete with the edison light bulbs and old silent movies playing in the background. if i lived in la, i'd probably be coming here after work pretty often.
great place for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, late night performance of weird vintage french clowns (i think) or friday &quot;depression era&quot; 35cent drinks. and it's really an amazing space; very impressive and interesting decor.
wow, this place is gorgeous. you are greeted by a bouncer in a 20's style suit and hostess in flapper garb. the decor and architecture are stunning. we went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and got there around 6- <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is from 5-7. first, they gave us each a ticket good for one 35cent martini. the martini you get is whatever they have decided is the &quot;special&quot; of the night. they were fairly strong and really tasty. most of the tables were taken or reserved, but they let us sit in a reserved table until just before the party was set to arrive an <span class="highlighted">hour</span> later. good service overall. they also have a 5 for $5 deal for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food. this does not mean you get 5 items for $5 though. you get 5 items priced at $5 each. the serving sizes aren't bad though, and you get sweet potato or regular fries with each! the calamari was good, nice lemony flavor going on. my friend said the kobe burgers were really good as well. it was a bummer that the drinks were so expensive though. i would absolutely come back for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> again, but i need to be richer before i'm down with $15 drinks. the place is so nice though- i won;t take away a star for that.
i love this place! &nbsp;i've been to the edison only once so far and i will be definaltely be coming back really soon! &nbsp;the decor is awesome! &nbsp;i spent the first 10-15 minutes there just looking around and checking out the place! &nbsp;the crowd was cool. &nbsp;mostly people from the nearby offices in downtown l.a. &nbsp;the prices are the norm. &nbsp;i was there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> which had a 20%(?) discount on the drinks only. &nbsp;the food that i ordered did not have any <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. &nbsp;only the drinks.....which is still fine with me. &nbsp;i came there to drink! =)
omfg! i was so blown away by the interior of this place! beautiful! i was so underprepared for this.i went with 2 friends for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. we found a small table and enjoyed a couple drinks and $5 appetizers.i need to go back for dinner with reservations to enjoy the full experience!
i have very conflicting feelings about the edison. the decor and atmosphere is the best in la in my opinion. they have creative ideas for <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> and the green fairy floating around with her absinthe cart is cool. the only problem: the overpriced cocktails that taste awful. the cocktails are consistently weird, especially the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials. last time i was there on a thursday night i was served a strange gin banana beer mixture that started to curdle. i think i'll have to opt for the beer if i go in the future.
the order.<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> wings<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> calamarii dig the theme and ambience of this place. the setup is gorgeous. the thai-inspired wings were good for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> offerings. the coconut milk/cream dipping sauce not so much. the calamari is a miss. the lime aioli dipping sauce &nbsp;was probably better than the actual calamari.the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is more than reasonable. okay wine offerings. my cabernet paired really well with the food. the syrah was pretty average. the sweeter riesling had a nice subtle sweetness (apple-sweet).my only gripe is that you can't really sit anywhere. and at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> i kind of want to sit somewhere. maybe if i came here with reservations and had a place to sit other than in front of the bathroom, i'd like it a lot more. i don't like to wander aimlessly and pretend im comfortable. kind of hard to find but it's a gem indeed if you do find it in the alleyway off of 2nd.
best <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> in la! really good drinks at 40% off. it's a really cool bar that is chill for after work, it is too dramatic at night. and there is an awesome bartender, diahnna, there, not pronounced like diana.
it is a crime against humanity that i have never written a review about this unique dtla bar. &nbsp;the edison has been a beautiful backdrop to many wonderful dtla outings with friends et. al. &nbsp;although it was not a part of minty's dtla dive bar crawl last friday (how could it be? &nbsp;it is not divey at all! &nbsp;it's gorgeous), it was my first stop and meeting place with anthony. &nbsp;as a restored basement of the southern california edison power plant with incredible, low-lit, cool, jazz-playing ambiance, you'll take a trip back to the roaring 1920's, flappers, classic bartenders, beautiful woodwork, with good drinks and food. &nbsp;they used to have these <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> for .35 cocktails and free grill cheese with tomato soup. &nbsp;but long after that special stopped, they have a 40% off <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. the sliders are made to perfection, medium rare, watercress topped, juicy and delicious. &nbsp;the truffle mac and cheese is yummy. &nbsp;the drinks are made of unique flavors and served with class. i loved the mistress and the brass flower. &nbsp;the dress code also brings the crowd up to a nice level of class. &nbsp;they have dinner and dancing later in the evening. &nbsp;unfortunately, i was disappointed at the lack of crowd when i went last friday for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;meaning, people... why are you not supporting great classic <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spots like the edison?!?!?! &nbsp;go and support these beautiful fantastic dtla venues! &nbsp;stop chasing the new! &nbsp;it's not as good. &nbsp;fortunately, later on our bar crawl when we left the redwood and , i noticed the business was booming at the edison, right down to the red rope and limos. &nbsp;yay! &nbsp;now just get your office mates out for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, people!
we love this place. it's real close to where we work so we try to make it out there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> at least once a week. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials are great and the food is great as well! &nbsp;reservations are recommended if you want to sit down since most tables are reserved even during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> times. &nbsp;the doorman has always been really polite to me and the hostesses are great too and always try to accommodate on those days where we decide to come last minute and don't have reservations. &nbsp;i recommend the french martini as my drink of choice. &nbsp;and they brought back the pretzel on the menu with the wasabi sauce! &nbsp;yummy!!!
a real classy joint. fancy cocktails. big fan of the place. they had a great &quot;depression&quot; <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> last summer, 35 cent martini (one per person) on fridays 5-7pm. but i'm not sure if they do that anymore...their dirty vodka martini may be a mean one, but it makes me <span class="highlighted">happy</span>.
i love coming here, the vibe is totally awesome.. i had my birthday party here and it was simply a great night. &nbsp;come early as some of my friends had to wait in line and i had to tip the bouncer $20 to get them in...drinks are good.. i was there after the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so i not sure about the $2 drinks. &nbsp;but will mos def check this place out on thursdays <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...
i had never ventured into the basement of this old building but it was well worth the visit.35cent cocktails during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>...you cant beat that. its a bit dark and secluded but the seats are comfy and you can be right in the mix of things by the bar or just chilling in convo !good decor
definitely the coolest spot i've been to in the country. &nbsp; the bartender sophia was extremely friendly and sweet and got our drinks and food in super fast 1 min before <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ended. &nbsp;thank you. &nbsp; &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> burger sliders were excellent, comes with 2.. also got the shrimp cocktail also very good. shrimp were large which was nice. &nbsp; &nbsp;take a few mins to walk around to look at everything inside.. it retains many of the mechanical and architectural artifacts from it's history as la's first private power plant. very romantic, great date spot.dress code enforced. &nbsp;collared shirt, nice shoes for guys.
came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>.. though it's dim, dark, and you can't read the menu, who cares? it's $0.35 martinis on thursdays.. well, it's watered down but what do you think you get for 35 cents. &nbsp;overall, still an great place to chill... bar food is one of the best i've had.
favorite bar in la. it's swank and speakeasy-like but spacious. last time i was there a woman did aerial silks by the bar which was really awesome (and totally random). the drinks are pricey but really good. also, they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. dress code is pretty strictly enforced so dress to impress!
i want to live here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i fell in love.got there early for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a fri. eve, no line.found a seat right away, and with the dim lighting and decor it was the perfect place to be!!---i almost felt like i was in the early prohibition era and felt a bit guilty about having a drink like it was illegal!!lol
this place was amazing!! my first time and went before art walk met up with some new friends and had a blast ....people were very friendly great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>..good starting point for art walk....downside was the bathrooms are pitch black....go figure...lol
life has been stressful and i really needed a drink. &nbsp;so tonight i went back to the edison for another <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to what they called the &quot;depression era cocktail <span class="highlighted">hour</span>&quot; from 5pm to 7pm on thursdays. &nbsp;tonight, their special 35 cent martini was &quot;the direct flight&quot; made with aviation gin, a splash of pernod, and a squeeze of blood orange. &nbsp;it was a cute pink martini, but too fruity. &nbsp;don't get me wrong, it was still well worth 35 cents. &nbsp;i wanted something more interesting so i ordered the absinthe 75 made with absinthe, sugar, and champagne. &nbsp;i was disappointed that i didn't see any green fairies, but i got a nice buzz from it. &nbsp;the drink wasn't super sweet, fruity, or weak, but refreshing. &nbsp;i liked it.my friend ordered the side car martini and it did not disappoint. &nbsp;it was golden and had a strong liquor flavor. &nbsp;i later found out it was made with cognac. this visit i decided to try something different and made a reservation at open table. &nbsp;luckily i was able to get a reservation at 5pm. &nbsp;this was the last reservation available for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for the next month. &nbsp;crazy! &nbsp;well, it worked out and they brought me to an intimate little corner booth where the music wasn't as loud. &nbsp;it was nice to carry on a good conversation here without shouting and losing my voice.waiter service needs to be improved, thus one less star. &nbsp;it took awhile for them to come by my table and take my order. &nbsp;however, the food service was great and the tesla fries arrived to the table in good time.parking is always an obstacle in downtown. &nbsp;the lot adjacent to the edison building was $8, but if you wanted to save some money, try parking a few blocks away where it's $4-5 from 4pm to closing. &nbsp;if you don't like parking in downtown at all, try taking the metro. &nbsp;the red and purple lines can take you to civic center station, where the edison is just a 5 minute walk away.overall, it was another great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;great vibe at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and there was no line to get into the place. &nbsp;i love their martinis and tesla fries!
i loved the atmosphere of the edison bar with the exposed brick, dark wood and high ceilings... although with the loud music it felt much more like a club than an after work <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> spot. &nbsp;nevertheless, we friday night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> tour-ers elbowed our way into a seating area, finally flagged down a waitress and began diligent consumption. &nbsp;their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ran from 5-8pm (love the extended <span class="highlighted">hour</span> to 8pm!) and offered half off anything on their menu. &nbsp;we love love loved the original french 75 cocktail and the calamari and sweet potato fries weren't bad either. &nbsp;be warned that service is very slow... we ordered our next round as soon as our drinks were delivered.
edison <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, i love you. 40% off drinks. bites of food. not that it's even that good a deal because the cocktails are normally $14, but man, i love this place. can i just come here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and curl up with a book in a little crevice until all those fancy people come who are sitting at all those reserved tables. (i mean, are those tables all really reserved? come on. i also liked the various sized reserved signs. some were small. some were big. some were hiding behind candles.) regardless. love this cavernous place. i'm just going to come here to do cartwheels and walk laps.
by far one of the best venues in downtown right now. it's hard to believe how big this place is, especially since it's not easy to find. the entrance is kinda hidden in the alley where the bums kick it, and you actually go downstairs once you come in. what used to be the boiler room for this building, is now this really nice and trendy lounge inside with lots of room to sit and mingle.to be honest, i've only been in on thursdays and fridays for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and i'm usually dressed up for work... so i can't give solid imput on the complaints getting in or the strict dress code policy.drinks run in the $6-8 range during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and go up in the $10+ range after 7pm. they used to offer free appetizers during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. i'm not sure if thats the case anymore. it's mostly the young professionals and the new neighbors early evenings during the week and the &quot;too cool for school&quot; crowd late nites and weekends. this is definitely not a t-shirt / jeans / nikes place if you know what i mean... so westsiders and eastsiders beware. not ideal for dancing and topping off your drink tanks here either. basically, this is the place to come to when its time to act and look cooler than you really are.
im torn between giving this place a 5 star or a 2 star so i'll give it a 3 star.the good1. they have a &nbsp;theme and follow it - everything from the old skool trench coat door guards to the black and white movies showing on the walls2. the live band3. thursday night <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> &nbsp;.35 martinis4. it's a large place5. ample couches to park ur ass6. people seem cool/friendlythen there's the bad1. lack of parking2. 9.00 valet parking! (not including tip!)3. after <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> drink prices are pricey - i got 1 beer and a long island - 23.00! (not including tip!) (btw - the long island was the weakest long island i have ever had... i'm serious)so i would say it's a 5 star on thursdays and 2 star on every other night.
i love this place. the ambiance is really unique. you definitely need to go at least once. i've been here several times for various occasions - <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, lucent dossier nights, and birthday parties - and i've always had a great time and there's no cover charge!
great place to have <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work. food is pretty good and i'm in love with their sweet potatos frys. if you like sweets try their desserts. if your going on a friday or sat night get ready to wait. best &nbsp;time to go is around 9:30 when its still early.
this place is a nice establishment, nostalgic feeling. you walk down a flight of stairs into the 1920's. &nbsp;good drinks, amazing waitresses that seem to always be around your location and attentive to your drinking needs. &nbsp;this place is has low lighting and is very loud. &nbsp;i have been there several times and all times it has been packed. &nbsp;if you show up late, most likely you will be standing. &nbsp;the drinks are a bit pricey but well worth it. &nbsp;i would come more often but it is a bit far from my work for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;hmm, they do have taxi's, oh well. &nbsp;this is a good spot for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and on.
yes, it's busy. yea, it's in downtown. but the venue is pretty awesome, and if you haven't been there you should definitely give it a chance. i've only been there twice (once at night, and once for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>). the bartenders have always been awesome and friendly. drinks are unique and strong. crowd is late 20's, early 30's maybe. for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they give you a drink coupon for the drink of the day for $1. the one i had was a mix of ginger beer, bourbon, other stuff. sorry that wasn't that descriptive. not a huge fan of bourbon, but it was a well-made drink. the absinthe fairy is also a cool touch, but note that she only works thursday-sunday. what a slacker. i think they have burlesque dancers on thursday. come before 10 if you want to avoid the crowd.
been here twice and my best advice would be is arrive early or avoid saturday nights because it tends to get too crowded. the ambiance and decor is awesome. not your ordinary hollywood scene. they had a burlesque type show when i went which was great to see. lol but not sure if it is a permanent thing they have. the place doesn't have a dance floor. also its somewhat of a loud place.the drinks are solid but cost around $10- $15. their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is great. their food service tends to be really busy on the weekends. i went on a saturday and it took us about 30 min to get inside and about 15 min to order drinks. the second time i went was on a thursday night and i think i had a better time! no waiting in line. food was awsome. <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices. &nbsp;the place had enough people where we could mingle. overall it was more relaxed.
the edison is a former power plant. &nbsp;the venue is broken up into a variety of spaces from intimate curtained booths to lounge areas, a stage and dance floor and an upstairs smoking lounge. they claim they enforce elegant dress code, but anyone dressed appropriately can get in. &nbsp;the cocktail here is amazing. &nbsp;the food is ok. &nbsp;they have great deals for <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> if you on a budget. &nbsp;people were friendly. &nbsp;we got invited to and ended up sharing a booth with people we met there. &nbsp;it's a classy club.
i came here for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> after work. this place has such a cool vibe to it. the evening we came there was a live band. live music is always a nice touch for watering holes. the ambiance had a &quot;classic&quot; feel to it. there were plenty of seating options whether you were looking to be in the middle of it all, in an intimate area, or at a bar. the drink prices were a little richer but to me it's worth the ambiance.
i wish that i could give it a 3.5 to be honest but i am rounding up, feeling generous today. its a trendy little lounge to hang with your friends but not the kind of place for any real conversations. have not tried their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> but have heard good things.
it's places like edison that makes downtown such a gem. it's a great place to hang out for <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> or on the weekends. i love friday <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> for their soup kitchen deals. the line to get in on the weekends can be 1 <span class="highlighted">hour</span> long so thank goodness i know somebody that lives in the loft building that this place is under who can take us in without a wait. dress code is enforced so please don't be the guy wearing sneakers while the rest of your group actually paid attention to the dress code. be classy and don't ruin it for them. it's a great place to meet people and be able to talk to them without having to yell at the top of your lungs. they have a great drink called the english afterthought that they won 2nd place for at some competition. try it if you like st. germaine and ginger. you can also order food too for the late night munchies.
new icon of los angeles. &nbsp;if you actually know how to dress yourself you won't need to wait in line. &nbsp;classy. &nbsp;tip - fantastic cigar store next door. &nbsp;grab one and enjoy it in the upstairs smoking lounge after a few <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> snacks and cocktails.
i've been there 3-4 times over the past year and each time the experience was kind of blase and it felt like asian night (i'm half so i can say these things), but last night sold me on this place.i went there after work for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (after grabbing some dinner at mccormick's <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>) and was delighted. &nbsp;the crowd is just trying to let off some steam (ha, that works with the theme of the place) after work and is pretty laid back. &nbsp;it also wasn't overcrowded as i had expected to be.found a seat easily and proceeded to order drinks. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here is uh-mazing for what it is. &nbsp;don't get me wrong this place is expensive but <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> most everything is half off so you get to experience a place that usually gets a $$$ on yelp for $$ and maybe even $ if you choose correctlydrinks ordered:champagne -- probably not top shelf but definitely not andre.tom collins -- way to stiff and only really had a hint of what a tom collins tastes like; if you wanna get fucked up in a classy space, this place is the place to do it with this drink.czechvar (beer) -- looked like an ale, i'm not good classifying beers. &nbsp;wow, smooth almost sweet taste that had a crisp finish. &nbsp;no bitter bite at the end that a lot of beer has. &nbsp;smooth until the very end even as it warmed up. &nbsp;lady macbeth -- she couldn't wring her hands of the blood but she definitely knows how to make a creative drink. &nbsp;champagne mixed with port (giving it a blood red appearance). &nbsp;champagne and port actually went well together.the hemingway -- i like absinthe. &nbsp;i like champagne. &nbsp;this gave me both! &nbsp;i wasn't sure if they put absinthe in there or if it was just anise flavoring but i definitely got that peculiar absinthe buzz so its def. in there. &nbsp;problem with this drink: the absinthe overpowers the taste of the champagne so if you're not a fan of black licorice and want a safe choice, this isn't it. total spent: &nbsp;$32. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>....awesome.we also ordered the elvis which was a total binge considering its like a french toast with peanut butter (creamy as hell and didn't really stick like a jif commercial), bananas, and caramel dipping sauce. &nbsp;amazing stuff, but this was not on special and cost more than one of the specialty drinks.spending about $6.40 a drink in one of the coolest looking bars you'll ever see was well worth it.definitely recommend this to anyone.
the edison is gorgeous inside. &nbsp;it really is like stepping into 1920's new york or something. &nbsp;4 stars for the ambience. &nbsp;the crowd there was meh. &nbsp;wasn't terribly impressed, but hey, it is la after all. &nbsp; i loved the cute little fairy/waitress serving absinthe. &nbsp;such a cute idea! &nbsp; this would be a fun place to come for a birthday with a group of friends. &nbsp;i think it would def be more fun with a table! &nbsp;still - amazing decor - i want to go back sometime to catch it during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>!!
love this place!! great atmosphere. fun for a date or a night with friends. i personally like the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> a bit better than the evening crowd. the inside is utterly gorgeous. i have never had the food, so i have no idea how that is, but the drink selection is very good.
i love this place! it's my new favorite bar. decor and ambiance are amazing and the service and cocktails were superb. i was there for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (5:00-7:00, mon-fri) and drinks were 40% off. i can't wait to go back!
i love this bar. it's such a cool idea in a really awesome spot. i just wish it was more affordable to make myself a regular.the appetizers are &quot;ok&quot;. nothing great. the staff will try to push the mac and cheese with truffle oil which is kind of dry. rest of the apps aren't anything special, but <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pricing is fair.the beer selection is awesome as they have my favorite - delirium tremens - in stock (with the glasses if you're lucky and people haven't stolen them all).drinks are pretty pricey outside of <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but reasonable compared to other downtown bars. if you make friends with a waitress and complain a bit during their &quot;off-<span class="highlighted">hours</span>&quot; they will willingly waive the &quot;per-person&quot; charge. be sure to tip generously. the waitstaff is pretty awesome. the atmosphere is very laid back, and the attire is upscale, a bit. but you can really go in wearing anything other than street clothes and i think you'll be alright.you'll see a lot of cool old pieces from the old edison electric plant there, but beware of their stools as they've been known to come apart. not sure if that's the intention.again, cool place, pretty chill - but be prepared to pay for it. upscale comes with a price tag and it ain't cheap.
this place is amazing, especially when you know the secret of coming early for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and staying here for the evening when it turns into a really elegant bar/nice club. &nbsp;the scene here is not awful like hollywood clubs, it is more...classy. &nbsp;the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> stuff is great, you can try their yummy drinks on the cheaper as well as their yummy food. &nbsp;i have been here once late and had to pay a $10 cover, but i wasn't bummed out by it because i was enjoying a fun night of drinking and dancing with my friends. &nbsp;the green fairy comes around with cute little bottles of different colored absinthe. $8 each. &nbsp;the mescal drink on the menu is great, and they have a nice selection of whiskeys if you are into that sort of thing. &nbsp;the place is beautiful and huge and must see.come early if you are not the clubby/crowded places type of person.come late if you like crowds and clubs and want to dance and drink the night away.also, there were burlesque dancers on the saturday night that i went. &nbsp;they were pretty great. &nbsp;as was the dj. &nbsp;she was excellent!ohhhh...and they project old silent films on the walls, soooooo cool!
fabulous old-school classy lounge. the atmosphere, staff and decor will take you back to the 1920s. you can sip on an ol' french 75 (my personal favorite) in the boiler room while you lounge on a comfy couch and people watch. good during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, drinks are 40% off. and ladies, wear a dress! that's pretty much the standard attire for ladies. gentlemen, wear something classy. no sports bar attire. :)
great decor, fun environment. i went for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> to meet for a friends birthday. the bartenders seemed really slammed, and our cocktail server was slow but the ambiance was enough to keep me entertained whist i wait for my $15 martini. over all it was interesting enough for me to want to go back. definitly worth another shot.
i honestly have no complaints.conveniently located downtown - you can park on the street, in a cheap garage, or take the metro.you do have to dress nice, but that's part of the fun. it can be pricey if you go with the specialty cocktails, but that's normal for la! if you go during the week before 7pm, you get a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> cocktail (35 cent drink), and if you go during the winter and donate an unwrapped toy, you get a free drink.
this place is going downhill!latest visit on a thu night for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! 35c martini is available but only for your 2nd drink and only 1 option: this disgusting drink that looks and probably tastes like horse urine. so, you will have to buy 1 drink first, which even with 40% off at hh, is still $10, what a rip-off. food choices are very limited and very pricey $7/$9/$14, very tiny portions. seriously, where did all the good-looking people go?
i came here expecting a speakeasy environment but in reality the environment felt like any other restaurant. their drinks were overpriced but still managed to grab a few during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> for 40% off. the sliders i ordered were over done and dry. idk if it's just me or not, but the whole place was so dark i had to turn on my flashlight on from my phone to look at the menu. it was a mediocre experience for me, will not be returning back. &nbsp;p.s. anyone getting absinthe should avoid it at all cost, you're better off buying real absinthe online.
<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on a thursday is pretty good. the .35cent cocktail was nice and they offered a nice selection of drinks and appetisers. the bartenders were very friendly but once it started getting busy i felt that there wasn't enough of them. seating is tricking if you arrive late. be careful going down the stairs especially when you are drunk! you can seriously hurt yourself if not careful... pretty scary. would go there on a weekday but definitely avoid it on the weekends (fri-sat).
this place used to be awesome! &nbsp;the ambiance is still the best thing about the edison. if you plan to go on saturday you must make reservations. &nbsp;i would recommend a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> during the week. &nbsp;drinks are pricy but overall this place is good spot to hit up if you are in downtown during the week.
beautiful venue. &nbsp;great place to go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;traffic can be tough coming from dtla, but both lot and street parking are available once you get there. &nbsp;this is the type of lounge i've always been looking for. &nbsp;too bad i don't get to frequent this place on a regular basis. &nbsp;good decor, good drinks, good food, good service, good music, good times.
the edison is in a super shady part of downtown, but it is a gem. the spiral staircase leads you downstairs. it has an almost mystical feeling to it. there is something very old hollywood about this place. on any given night you may see a group of flappers swing dancing, a cirque du soleil act, a burlesque show, etc. the bartenders and girls on the floor are great. &nbsp;they all look sharp and are very friendly. good drinks, fair prices. i've heard they have a great <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but i've never been. definitely a spot to check out.
i like the decor of this place and it's incredibly spacious. the drinks are pretty strong always a plus. this is a great place to have a celebration with friends. the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> specials they have are a steal. the stairs are serious for the girls that love to wear stilletos walk very slowly for the floor throughout is slippery too.i didn't stay for the entertainment but i heard it can get wild literally.
bumping up my rating of the edison thanks to my visit last wednesday. &nbsp;<span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> prices and drinks selection are still excellent, but they've addressed my main issue which was the wait for service. &nbsp;gone is the cattle call at the bar, and now you can enjoy the attentive service of a slew of waitstaff. &nbsp;also, the bartenders themselves have gone way up in quality of service.another big plus is the entertainment - make sure to check out the show on wednesdays. &nbsp;and don't miss the kobe sliders!
one of the coolest places in la. such interesting decor and so many fun drinks (go during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> because it gets super crowded later on). oh yeah and the place is enormous!i'm not a huge fan of the location, but eh, what are you gonna do. also, it's very mellow so don't arrive expecting to get your boogie on...
the edison is definitely a swanky bar done right and on wednesday nights, when there is a pseudo-carnival/burlesque show, it is a steampunk fantasy done right. &nbsp;that being said, its cover charges are annoying and its drinks are way too expensive -- $10 for a well vodka soda is annoying anywhere, especially in a place that is not a club.wednesday nights feature a fun burlesque show and on thursday there is a jazz band. &nbsp;moreover, there are movies being shown on multiple walls so this place is ideal for someone with add -- sensory overload at all times.there is a popular <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> here and this place is one of the go-to spots for the downtown <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> scene. &nbsp;there is no shortage of attorneys here. &nbsp;hahaif you come later at night, especially on friday or saturday, expect a long line. &nbsp;that can definitely be super annoying when the line is not moving and when you walk inside to see so much space available. &nbsp;it's something that i expect in hollywood but not in dtla.the clientele is generally nicely dressed and good looking -- no complaints here.a good spot, though expensive. &nbsp;and i do recommend the english after-thought drink. &nbsp;yum.
time: 8pmday: fridaycrowd: lingering <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> professionals, couples, groups of girls and groups of guysthere was no line. we had no trouble finding two tables. our waiter was on top of shizz and best of all? i didn't give a damn about how much the drinks and food cost. i just wanted to have a good time. and, i did.if you tend to complain about queues, expensive food and drink, and standing whilst eating and drinking said expensive vittles, then don't go to the edison. please, don't. go elsewhere. go!
i was pleasantly surprised by the edison. &nbsp;i've been hearing about it for a while but had never ventured in. &nbsp;i was even more pleased when there was no cover and the flapper chick at the front door handed us gold coins for our 35 cent cocktail. &nbsp;35 cents? whatch talkin bout willis? and it was damn good! &nbsp;after this the drinks were between $5-$10. still not too bad.their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> features $5 appetizers. i had the kobe beef slider. my friend had the calamari. &nbsp;both came with a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. &nbsp;yum!their house drinks have fancy little names that you will never remember but if you're the adventurous type give them a try. &nbsp;the vibe is cool, no sleazy guys trying to hit on us. bartenders were friendly. although one guy was a complete ass, but i think he thought he was being cool. &nbsp;all in all their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> is on point. &nbsp;i'll definitely be back!
it's been awhile since i came back, but this place is still uber cool and groovy, and i still love this unpretentious downtown diverse crowd. as soon as nance and i walked in, a cute lady handed us a ticket for 35 cents martini, then she goes, 'you better hurry, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> ends soon.' now i love establishments like this where they honor <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and give you a heads up. grant it, the martini sort of tastes like a hint of lemon juice with aspirin, but heck, it's freaking 35 cents! although it was like 10 min. past 7pm, the waitress still took our hh order. i love her! here is my favorite to least hh menu (5 bucks for each): - kobe beef slider (comes with sweat potato fries) - yummo! - wings - sweet and meaty, just the way i like it! (comes with skinny fries) - calamari - where are did they go?!? (so little and so mediocre) - grilled cheese sandwich - honestly, i can make better grilled cheese sandwich with kraft cheese and wonder bread... (it was so sad and so pathetic, super disappointed)need more excuse to come out? &nbsp;check out during the art walk (every 2nd thursday of the month), grab a drink before heading out.

so, nikola tesla and thomas edison go into a bar...oh, you've heard this one. the edison is a glamourous place in downtown with impeccable design and a quirky sense about its pricing and <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>. you could easily pay $50 for a straight scotch, or $0.35 for champagne. it depends on what time you go. it's small, but cavernous, expensive; yet features soup-kitchen era prices for its specials. all and all, it's a gem in los angeles and worth experiencing.
this place is amazing. it's located in what used to be the old edison building, hence the name. the old generators are still there. the decor is 1920's, and it does remind me of the glitz and glamour of that era. there's silent movies playing on various walls and hostesses dressed up in era costumes. the cocktails here are amazing. i recommend the edison martini and their gin cocktails. prices are steep, i recommend going during their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> or sometimes on thurs night, they have a 35 cent drink special.
a few girlfriends and i ventured over to the edison for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> food/drinks on a friday. main reason we went was to score the 35 cent martini's they give out during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> (5-7 pm)!we went pretty early and paid $5 for parking not even a block away. once you get to the entrance to the edison, you'll see bouncers who check id (so official!) outside of what looks like a bit shady. walk inside and wallah, beautiful. walk down a flight of stairs and become enthused about the beautiful interior design and architecture. self seating, wherever you can find a table (recommend you reserving one in advance though) or high top where people just lounge and be cool. for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> they have the 5 for $5 each deal and i would say everything on the menu is worth it! we (5 of us) ordered two grilled cheeses, chicken wings, sliders, and fries. they were all so delicious, especially the grilled cheese = melt in your mouth delicious. although at first we figured the portions were small, it was plenty of food to keep us &quot;just right&quot; for the rest of the night. the drinks were a bit pricier. i remember it being about $12 or $13?? personally don't think they were exceptional but good nonetheless. as for the 35 cent cocktails...apparently they change drinks every week or something? the day we went they served some cherry cocktail which tasted like robitussin bleghmy ratings are mostly on the actual loung/bar/restaurant and food more than the drinks. hope to experience the nightlife there soon though! ohhhh and even if you don't have to use it, i recommend you fancying yourself over to use the restroom. so cute and they have complimentary andes mint chocolates ;)
rocked up to the edison around 9 on sat. nite with a friend and they let my slobby self in -- i only had to button down my untucked shirt... door guy said the jeans are not a problem. i wasn't wearing sneakers -- not sure whether or not that woulda been an issue.the space really truly is awesome, and massive -- apparently you can still move around easily when it's at its 400+ capacity. we got to sit in one of the primo booths overlooking the place since the people who would inevitably kick us out because of their reservation ($400 -- it was &nbsp;unclear as to whether or not that is just for the table, for bottle service, or a minimum bar tab). a dj was spinning some great hard bop (the kind of jazz that i happened to listen to obsessively in the late '90s before i convinced myself that alas there still is great music being made today), apparently there's live jazz on wednesday evenings on the smallish stage.i&quot;ll only return during weeknight <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span>, most likely, 5-8 i believe, when drinks are &quot;cheap&quot; as the bartender said, which actually means normally priced. everything is about 40% off at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. normally priced, however, beers go for $7 and martinis (my friend had this killer scharfenbarger chocolate and i had a makers manhattan) were $13 and probably went up from there. there are numerous sitting areas and, at the time we were there, pretty early on a sat nite, groups of guys and girls wearing probably too much black were sitting around yapping. by the time we left, folks that appeared to think a bit too highly of themselves began strutting down the stairs. i mean there wasn't snot visibly coming out of their noses, but -- i don't know, they were probably really nice actually.the manager said its been getting more chill there, although fridays and sats can get pretty packed. this is one of the most handsome large bar/lounges i've ever been in and, yeah, it's true, you've all gotta check it out. i'm down for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> anytime.
come here for the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! you will not be disappointed. they have their special <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> serving $.35 aviators and $1 martinis every wednesday and thursday. they open at 5:00 pm for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, right in time to welcome the young professionals through the door.food: they have a menu with 5 items, each for $5. get anything with fries because their fries are delicious! the kobe beef slider is also really good too. each plate of food is the perfect portion to eat by yourself while not filling you up too much.service: right at 5:00 pm, there aren't too many people here yet so you get a lot of attention from your bartender who are very friendly and helpful. also, another perk for getting here on the early side is that you beat the crowd and assure yourself a nice and comfy seat at the bar. seating at the bar is key because seating at any of the open tables requires a minimum charge.decor: the interior of this place is amazingly gorgeous. inspired by the 1920s prohibition era, it gives off a vibe of secret and speak-easy bar. it's also very spacious inside, sure to be a great destination for any large party.tip: be sure to get a token from the hostess at the entrance. this token will give you access to the cheap drinks. i think you only get to choose one. the aviators are pretty good and surprisingly strong. i think i remember the martinis from my last visit weren't that great, but i'm not really a martini girl anyway.
i was hesitant at first when i heard about this place being an old powerplant. &nbsp;&quot;am i going to deteriorate from the radiation?&quot; or &quot;is my skin going to change colors?&quot;. &nbsp;i know i'm just exaggerating and they wouldn't open a prestige place like this for the public to hang out and have some c&amp;c (company and conversation).the 1920's ambiance is very unique. &nbsp;it has that gothic/vintage atmosphere when you enter from the spiral staircase. &nbsp;me and the wifey came here during <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> from 5pm-7pm on a weeknight. &nbsp;it was the best time after work and have a drink or two chilling in a old fashionable sofa. &nbsp;when i was kinda buzzed, i would trip out from watching the silent movies they were showing in tv. they serve different kinds of beer poured in a big glass and mixed drinks. &nbsp;on weeknights at <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, you get a free token for a free martini. i love that. self parking is plenty coming from the entrance at main st. and i paid $5. &nbsp;i had fun hanging out having my glass of stella artois.
with 1099 reviews, the edison probably doesn't need one more from me, but oh well.advice on how to best enjoy it if you're not looking to spend a lot:1. have fun with the dress code. don't get stressed out and start talking about &quot;guh so la&quot; ... just treat it as a fun excuse to dress up;2. go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. at 5-5:30, the edison is empty. you can sit anywhere, explore the whole bar, and avoid some of the more intense patrons. also! <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> features drink tickets for a $1 cocktail... the cocktail changes (i think daily), but they make their drinks well. i've never had anything that wasn't at least decent, and for $1 plus that setting, who can complain?3. don't valet (if you're being cost conscious, at least). there's tons of cheaper parking available downtown;4. get your $1 cocktail, wander around a little, use the fancy bathrooms, and then move on. all of a sudden, the edison is the cheapest bar experience in la. there are a lot of great bars downtown to move onto.
one of the coolest places to go to in downtown los angeles. &nbsp;weekend nights are hot-- come here early on friday and saturday nights if you want to avoid a line, before 1030pm.thursday night <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> are also cool-- i believe they have a drink special before 6 or 7pm. &nbsp;i highly recommend this place-- the crowd is cool, the venue is chic, and it is just a great place to hang out at.
very cool and very hip decor! &nbsp;i love this space. &nbsp;it's stupid expensive unless you go for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, but the hh deals are really cool. &nbsp;i had a steak and fries meal that was only $12. &nbsp;the steak was really pretty great for the money--i could not see paying the regular $24 for this though. &nbsp;the place is cool, but not that cool. :) &nbsp;their wings were good...the bf liked the mac and cheese too.the wine was just ok, but i loved their selections of rum and found a lovely spiced one that i drank most of the night instead of my usual wine.if you want to eat here, make reservations.
i'd been wanting to check out the edison for awhile. i had red about it and seen it on tv. finally one of my friends was having a <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> and decided to do it at the edison. it's an after work <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> so i ended getting to the place around 7:30pm, no line parking is easy. things are looking up. i'm in a full suit no tie and i walk right up to the doorman had him my id. he stares at my id, then me, then proceeds to look me up and down, its 7:30 no one is there, if he didn't let me in it was going to be a problem, he finally lets me in. i go look for my friends and as i look for them i check out the place. to me it definitely lives up to the hype, the decor is great combining the old edison industrial warehouse feel with that of a bar/club. this place definitely gets warm as the night progresses. there is a dj and music is playing but i can still have a conversation. i ended up leaving at around 11pm. the line to get in now goes down the block. i wonder how many the doorman will turn away.
the only good thing mentioning is the venue itself. classy 20's decor, spacious, mature crowd (in terms of age), and has dancing performances once in a while. on the flip side, they have this ridiculous line that is usually a one <span class="highlighted">hour</span> minimum wait. i'm going to probably call out everybody right now but whoever waits in this line is sad. i say this in the nicest way possible, this place is for douchebags on the weekends. though <span class="highlighted">happy hours</span> here are great! they have great promotions... so say no to weekends children!
after one visit, i'm in love. beautiful decor, friendly staff, and great atmosphere. the drinks are a little on the high end, but they are awesome and well worth your money. the bartenders know what they are doing. went here for a friend's party, our bartender billy made us the best drinks. i will definitely be back, maybe i can make it for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>?
one of favorite places to go for a downtown drink.great retro, prohibition-era decor out of a former edison (get it?) power plant. &nbsp;it's like experience a bit of american as well as local la-history at the same time.lots of entertainment that also follows this retro theme.this place does have a dress code so if you're dressed casual/shabby, esp on weekend nights, good luck getting in, even if there isnt a line.for more hassle free entry, <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> on the weekdays is suggested.
i love the decor. so i came here today after work for their friday <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>: 35cent cocktail w/ complimentary grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup.35cent = a choice of two drinksgrilled cheese sandwich, you get half of a sandwich (cut diagonally)tomato soup - it was a baby portion ... a size of a shot of espresso, i would say.parking... well it's downtown, what do you expect? you either come here after 6pm for free meter parking (if you're lucky) or you pay $9 for their valet.you have another option of parking in one of those public parking lots...flat rates of $3, $5, $8, or $9 (depending how far / close you want to park)i think this would be a nice place to host a party, i really like the vibe of the depression era.my friend and i were so hungry that we went around the corner to pitfire pizza for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> pizza.. go read my review
+ &nbsp;amazing scenery/ambiance/decor+ &nbsp;experienced bartenders- &nbsp;long lines if you come late- &nbsp;reservations needed for any seating, even if it just a stool in a random corner of the loungei'm lucky to have this place basically across the street from my office. &nbsp;there are generally no lines right at 5pm if folks want to go to <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>. &nbsp;the decor of the place is very unique and everyone i bring here is always impressed. &nbsp;drinks are good (but can be pricey) and sometimes you can be lucky to catch a show on the stage.my only complaint is that any seating in the lounge requires a reservation (or $50/person bill if there isn't a sold out event). &nbsp;i suppose it is okay if you intend to spend some time here, but sometimes i would like to sit down. &nbsp;even the small stools/chairs in a small corner of the place has a &quot;reserved&quot; tag so you're left to stand the entire time.the crowd is definitely older and more classy which is what i like. &nbsp;you generally won't see low to mid 20 year old here. &nbsp;i would say most are 30 or older at least.
4 stars all the way for their <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>! honestly, what can beat 35 cent martinis?! unfortunately, you only get one and sadly for me i'm not a big enough fan of gin to enjoy the martini they were serving the day i was there. but hey, can't complain too much! it was worth less than what i would find under my sofa cushion. on top of that, there is also a 40% off special on all other drinks and a $5 food menu, which consists of typical bar food like fries and burgers -- nothing great. however, i will say that their hotdogs are pretty good. i was expecting something bland and basic, but instead it was an actual juicy sausage resting on a toasted sourdough bun with whole grain mustard. really tasty! another thing is that their dress code seemed non-existent during the <span class="highlighted">hours</span> of 5-7pm. so that's that, because the edison is only worth the trip during that time. anything other than <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, you will have to deal with a douchey bouncer, douchey crowd, and a &quot;strict&quot; dress code that's half-assedly enforced. one time they wouldn't let my friend in because he was wearing black asics, while a group of middle-aged bros wearing affiction t-shirts pranced right in. it was ridiculous.
5 stars, but it's best to come by on the weeknights.a sure bet for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, especially on thursdays for $.35 martinis. the music is good, crowd is great, and there are lots of beautiful areas to roam around and appreciate the history of the la's first private power plant.weekends are a complete zoo, and pull in more of the clubbing crowd. plan on waiting in line forever and dealing with all nuisances of a club atmosphere.
love this venue! great interior and ambiance. schedueld a meetup here on a thursday night because they had the live burlesque show in the evening. the absinthe fairy comes out a little aftr 8:30pm and start of the live shows.if you get here in time for <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>, the greeter gives you a token for a 35 cents 2nd drink. don't get too excited, it's half a glass and kind of taste like a white russian. &nbsp;seating is scarce here, monday - thursday there is a $25/person minumim in order to at one of the tables. fridays and saturdays it's $50.strict dress code for guys, you must wear a collar shirt, even if you have a jacket on.
1642-beer-and-wine-los-angeles
wine &amp; beer bar. this place is awesome. hidden, off the beaten path, dark private ambiance. &quot;tamale <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span>&quot; rules, thursdays from 6 to 8 pm. great live music. pretty packed late night.
hipster alert! hipster alert! you wouldn't even think so, considering the neighborhood it's in &amp; the bar's facade. you can barely tell it's a bar from the outside! seriously thought i needed a password to get in. haha. the beer selection is great. truth be told, i didn't even pay attention to the wine menu, as i was completely and utterly mesmerized by the stone smoked porter with vanilla bean that a friend ordered for me. yuuuum! i'd totally pour it into my coffee mug every morning, if it weren't frowned upon at work. the place is literally a hole in the wall. one long hallway with a bar, a few tables &amp; a pseudo-stage area. it was happening on a sunday night...not sure if it's normally that way or the bands were able to scrounge up all their friends to attend... making it super hot and claustrophobic. pretty chill spot to come have a good drank. will have to check out the tamale <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> peeps speak of.
the best way i can describe this place is as a diamond in the rough. you open the door and are transported to this world that you wouldn't think exists judging by the outside and adjacent buildings. a friend brought me here after work (super close) and i was glad she did. you won't even know this spot is here as there is no signage indicating this fine establishment exists. and to that i say, &quot;let's keep it like that; i don't wanna share you, 1642!&quot;like the name says, they serve wine and beer. not a huge selection, but a good one. oh, and on thursdays they have tamale <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> -- each beer entitles you to a free tamal (yeah...i know, right?). they have cool music playing, chill people socializing, and the drinks are a'pouring. this place is dark, cozy, and unassuming -- and i like it a lot!
prior to it's current installment, the 1642 was infamously known as &quot;lupita's&quot; which attained somewhat of a rep. amongst neighborhood resident's. it's good to see that the latest rendition has steered clear from it's predecessors past exploits.from the outside, the bar has the appearance of a &quot;hole in the wall&quot; so keep an eye out for the address while passing by or you just might miss it [hint: the locale is across the street from the cafe that looks like something outta the film 'george of the jungle' - minus brendan frasier, than again...encino man ii might not hit theaters until 2016. he's likely bussing tables]. as far as the interior, management has done a fine job with fixing up the joint. the decor is subtle &amp; the lighting fixtures are perfect -- not too dim nor too bright. aside from the bar area, a nice arrangement of tables are available for couples or small groups. the place somewhat resembles el prado in ep.with regards to the selection of brews; if your hankering for pbr, corona or miller light, well head out the front door &amp; take your behind to the nearest convenient store. because they ain't having that ish here. rather, a diverse selection of domestic &amp; international brews are at your disposal; from victory prima pils, iron fist - spice of life, maui coconut porter, and (one of my personal fav's) avery white rascal (rather rare in these parts -- earns a gold star in my book) on the flip side, the <span class="highlighted">happy hour</span> sch'd is rather sketchy. no <span class="highlighted">happy</span> hr present at 6pm on a friday night! what gives? for all the animal enthusiast (and haters), they have a feline mascot that lounges around the bar. cute &amp; all, but sylvester laying atop of the bar &amp; tables kinda raises the county health red card. there is a back area where patrons are permitted to smoke; however, i don't think neighboring residents would be too appreciative.patrons are a mixture of a neighborhood residents, scenesters &amp; aspiring artist/ musicians. on the night i ventured on out, i had colorful convo's with an artist who bared a striking resemblance to ramona flowers (&agrave; la scott pilgrim vs.) and a gentleman who claimed to be part &nbsp;of a &quot;secret society&quot; via a prestigious ivy league school out of the east coast (ha!). the 1642 is a welcoming addition to the neighborhood. on wednesday's live bands perform a mixture of genre's; from bluegrass to indie-folk. another welcoming sight, complementary peanuts &amp; pretzels at your disposal. this may sound pretty basic, but far too often these days, numerous establishments across socal don't bother to offer or in some instances...even charge for peanuts n' munchies (i'm looking at you bigfoot lodge). c'mom people, have we've lost our mannerisms &amp; etiquette at our local watering-hole's? for shame...luckily, there are still joints similar to the 1642 that remembers the way of the pint: affordable prices set to the common folks budget.
